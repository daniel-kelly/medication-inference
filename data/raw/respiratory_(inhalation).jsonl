The active component of FLOVENT DISKUS 50 mcg, FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg, and FLOVENT DISKUS 250 mcg is fluticasone propionate, a corticosteroid having the chemical name S- (fluoromethyl) 6\u03b1,9-difluoro-11\u03b2,17-dihydroxy-16\u03b1-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-17\u03b2-carbothioate, 17-propionate and the following chemical structure: Fluticasone propionate is a white powder with a molecular weight of 500.6, and the empirical formula is C 25 H 31 F 3 O 5 S. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide, and slightly soluble in methanol and 95% ethanol. FLOVENT DISKUS is an orange plastic inhaler containing a foil blister strip. Each blister on the strip contains a white powder mix of micronized fluticasone propionate (50, 100, or 250 mcg) in 12.5 mg of formulation containing lactose monohydrate (which contains milk proteins). After the inhaler is activated, the powder is dispersed into the airstream created by the patient inhaling through the mouthpiece. Under standardized in vitro test conditions, FLOVENT DISKUS delivers 46, 94, and 229 mcg of fluticasone propionate from FLOVENT DISKUS 50 mcg, FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg, and FLOVENT DISKUS 250 mcg, respectively, when tested at a flow rate of 60 L/min for 2 seconds. In adult subjects with obstructive lung disease and severely compromised lung function (mean FEV 1 20% to 30% of predicted), mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the DISKUS inhaler was 82.4 L/min (range: 46.1 to 115.3 L/min). In children with asthma aged 4 and 8 years, mean PIF through FLOVENT DISKUS was 70 and 104 L/min, respectively (range: 48 to 123 L/min). The actual amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors, such as inspiratory flow profile. Chemical structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When corticosteroids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer. Trials in subjects with asthma have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects with recommended doses of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, negligible oral systemic bioavailability (<1%), and the minimal pharmacological activity of the only metabolite detected in man. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using dosages up to and including 250 mcg twice daily, occasional abnormal short cosyntropin tests (peak serum cortisol <18 mcg/dL assessed by radioimmunoassay) were noted both in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and in subjects receiving placebo. The incidence of abnormal tests at 500 mcg twice daily was greater than placebo. In a 2-year trial carried out with the DISKHALER inhalation device in 64 subjects with mild, persistent asthma (mean FEV 1 91% of predicted) randomized to fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily or placebo, no subject receiving fluticasone propionate had an abnormal response to 6-hour cosyntropin infusion (peak serum cortisol <18 mcg/dL). With a peak cortisol threshold of <35 mcg/dL, 1 subject receiving fluticasone propionate (4%) had an abnormal response at 1 year; repeat testing at 18 months and 2 years was normal. Another subject receiving fluticasone propionate (5%) had an abnormal response at 2 years. No subject on placebo had an abnormal response at 1 or 2 years. In a placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in subjects aged 4 to 11 years, a 30-minute cosyntropin stimulation test was performed in 41 subjects after 12 weeks of dosing with 50 or 100 mcg twice daily of fluticasone propionate via the DISKUS inhaler. One subject receiving fluticasone propionate via the DISKUS inhaler had a prestimulation plasma cortisol concentration <5 mcg/dL, and 2 subjects had a rise in cortisol of <7 mcg/dL. However, all poststimulation values were >18 mcg/dL. The potential systemic effects of inhaled fluticasone propionate on the HPA axis were also studied in subjects with asthma. Fluticasone propionate given by inhalation aerosol at dosages of 220, 440, 660, or 880 mcg twice daily was compared with placebo or oral prednisone 10 mg given once daily for 4 weeks. For most subjects, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by 6-hour cosyntropin stimulation, remained intact with inhaled fluticasone propionate treatment. No subject had an abnormal response (peak serum cortisol <18 mcg/dL) after dosing with placebo or fluticasone propionate 220 mcg twice daily. For subjects treated with 440, 660, and 880 mcg twice daily, 10%, 16%, and 12%, respectively, had an abnormal response as compared with 29% of subjects treated with prednisone. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluticasone propionate acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate is negligible (<1%), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. In contrast, the majority of the fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung is systemically absorbed. The absolute bioavailability of fluticasone propionate from the DISKUS inhaler in healthy volunteers averages 7.8%. Peak steady-state fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations in adult subjects with asthma (N = 11) ranged from undetectable to 266 pg/mL after a 500-mcg twice-daily dose of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using the DISKUS inhaler. The mean fluticasone propionate plasma concentration was 110 pg/mL. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averages 99%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Metabolism The total clearance of fluticasone propionate is high (average, 1,093 mL/min), with renal clearance accounting for <0.02% of the total. The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Elimination Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Specific Populations Male and Female Patients: Full pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained from 9 female and 16 male subjects given 500 mcg twice daily. No overall differences in fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics were observed. Pediatric Patients: In a clinical trial conducted in subjects aged 4 to 11 years with mild to moderate asthma, fluticasone propionate concentrations were obtained in 61 subjects at 20 and 40 minutes after dosing with 50 and 100 mcg twice daily of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using the DISKUS. Plasma concentrations were low and ranged from undetectable (about 80% of the plasma samples) to 88 pg/mL. Mean peak fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations at the 50- and 100-mcg dose levels were 5 and 8 pg/mL, respectively. Patients with Hepatic and Renal Impairment: Formal pharmacokinetic studies using FLOVENT DISKUS have not been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, since fluticasone propionate is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. Drug Interaction Studies Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4: Ritonavir: Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range: 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC (0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022h/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC (0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range: 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022h/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in serum cortisol AUC. Ketoconazole: In a placebo-controlled, crossover trial in 8 healthy adult volunteers, coadministration of a single dose of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) with multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg) to steady state resulted in increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, a reduction in plasma cortisol AUC, and no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. Following orally inhaled fluticasone propionate alone, AUC (2-last) averaged 1.559 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 0.555 to 2.906 ng\u2022h/mL) and AUC (2-\u221e) averaged 2.269 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 0.836 to 3.707 ng\u2022h/mL). Fluticasone propionate AUC (2-last) and AUC (2-\u221e) increased to 2.781 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 2.489 to 8.486 ng\u2022h/mL) and 4.317 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 3.256 to 9.408 ng\u2022h/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ketoconazole with orally inhaled fluticasone propionate. This increase in plasma fluticasone propionate concentration resulted in a decrease (45%) in serum cortisol AUC. Erythromycin: In a multiple-dose drug interaction trial, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg 3 times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics."], "manufacturer_name": ["GlaxoSmithKline LLC"], "substance_name": ["FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE"], "effective_time": "20230811", "product_ndc": ["0173-0601", "0173-0602", "0173-0600"], "brand_name": ["FLOVENT DISKUS"]}

The drug substance tiotropium bromide monohydrate is chemically described as (1\u03b1, 2\u00df, 4\u00df, 5\u03b1, 7\u00df)-7-[(Hydroxydi-2-thienylacetyl)oxy]-9,9-dimethyl-3-oxa-9-azoniatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ] nonane bromide monohydrate. It is a synthetic, non-chiral, quaternary ammonium compound. Tiotropium bromide is a white or yellowish white powder. It is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in methanol. The structural formula is: Tiotropium bromide (monohydrate) has a molecular mass of 490.4 and a molecular formula of C 19 H 22 NO 4 S 2 Br \u2219 H 2 O. The drug substance olodaterol hydrochloride is chemically described as 2H-1,4-Benzoxazin-3H(4H)-one, 6-hydroxy-8-[(1R)-1-hydroxy-2-[[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,1-dimethylethyl]-amino]ethyl]-, monohydrochloride. Olodaterol hydrochloride is a white to off-white powder that is sparingly-slightly soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. The molecular weight is 422.9 g/mole (salt): 386.5 g/mole (base), and the molecular formula is C 21 H 26 N 2 O 5 \u00d7 HCl as a hydrochloride. The conversion factor from salt to free base is 1.094. The structural formula is: The drug product, STIOLTO RESPIMAT, is composed of a sterile aqueous solution of tiotropium bromide and olodaterol hydrochloride filled into a 4.5 mL plastic container crimped into an aluminum cylinder (STIOLTO RESPIMAT cartridge) for use with the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler. Excipients include, benzalkonium chloride, edetate disodium, hydrochloric acid, and water for injection. The STIOLTO RESPIMAT cartridge is only intended for use with the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler. The STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler is a hand held, pocket sized oral inhalation device that uses mechanical energy to generate a slow-moving aerosol cloud of medication from a metered volume of the drug solution. The STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler has a light green-colored cap. When used with the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler each cartridge, containing 4 grams of sterile aqueous solution, delivers the labeled number of metered actuations after preparation for use. Each dose (one dose equals two actuations) from the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler delivers 5 mcg tiotropium (equivalent to 6.247 mcg tiotropium bromide monohydrate) and 5 mcg olodaterol (equivalent to 5.473 mcg olodaterol hydrochloride) in 22.1 mcL from the mouthpiece. As with all inhaled drugs, the actual amount of drug delivered to the lung may depend on patient factors, such as the coordination between the actuation of the inhaler and inspiration through the delivery system. The duration of inspiration should be at least as long as the spray duration (1.5 seconds). Chemical Structure Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action STIOLTO RESPIMAT STIOLTO RESPIMAT contains both tiotropium and olodaterol. The properties described below for the individual components apply to STIOLTO RESPIMAT. These drugs represent 2 different classes of medication (an anticholinergic and a beta-agonist) that have different effects on clinical and physiological indices. Tiotropium Tiotropium is a long-acting, muscarinic antagonist which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors, M 1 to M 5 . In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M 3 -receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The bronchodilation following inhalation of tiotropium is predominantly a site-specific effect. Olodaterol Olodaterol is a long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABA). The compound exerts its pharmacological effects by binding and activation of beta 2 -adrenoceptors after topical administration by inhalation. Activation of these receptors in the airways results in a stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, an enzyme that mediates the synthesis of cyclic-3', 5' adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Elevated levels of cAMP induce bronchodilation by relaxation of airway smooth muscle cells. In vitro studies have shown that olodaterol has 241-fold greater agonist activity at beta 2 -adrenoceptors compared to beta 1 -adrenoceptors and 2,299-fold greater agonist activity compared to beta 3 -adrenoceptors. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Beta-adrenoceptors are divided into three subtypes: beta 1 -adrenoceptors predominantly expressed on cardiac muscle, beta 2 -adrenoceptors predominantly expressed on airway smooth muscle, and beta 3 -adrenoceptors predominantly expressed on adipose tissue. Beta 2 -agonists cause bronchodilation. Although the beta 2 -adrenoceptor is the predominant adrenergic receptor in the airway smooth muscle, it is also present on the surface of a variety of other cells, including lung epithelial and endothelial cells and in the heart. The precise function of beta 2 -receptors in the heart is not known, but their presence raises the possibility that even highly selective beta 2 -agonists may have cardiac effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology STIOLTO RESPIMAT In two 52-week randomized, double-blind trials using STIOLTO RESPIMAT that enrolled 5,162 patients with COPD, ECG assessments were performed post-dose on days 1, 85, 169, and 365. In a pooled analysis the number of subjects with changes from baseline-corrected QT interval of >30 msec using both the Bazett (QTcB) and Fredericia (QTcF), corrections of QT for heart rate were not different for the STIOLTO RESPIMAT group compared to olodaterol 5 mcg and tiotropium 5 mcg across the assessments conducted. Tiotropium The effect of tiotropium dry powder for inhalation on QT interval was also evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled crossover study in 53 healthy volunteers. Subjects received tiotropium inhalation powder 18 mcg, 54 mcg (3 times the recommended dose), or placebo for 12 days. ECG assessments were performed at baseline and throughout the dosing interval following the first and last dose of study medication. Relative to placebo, the maximum mean change from baseline in study-specific QTc interval was 3.2 msec and 0.8 msec for tiotropium inhalation powder 18 mcg and 54 mcg, respectively. No subject showed a new onset of QTc >500 msec or QTc changes from baseline of \u226560 msec. In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial using tiotropium dry powder for inhalation that enrolled 198 patients with COPD, the number of subjects with changes from baseline-corrected QT interval of 30\u201360 msec was higher in the tiotropium group as compared with placebo. This difference was apparent using both the Bazett (QTcB) [20 (20%) patients vs. 12 (12%) patients] and Fredericia (QTcF) [16 (16%) patients vs. 1 (1%) patient] corrections of QT for heart rate. No patients in either group had either QTcB or QTcF of >500 msec. Other clinical trials with tiotropium did not detect an effect of the drug on QTc intervals. Olodaterol The effect of olodaterol on the QT/QTc interval of the ECG was investigated in 24 healthy male and female volunteers in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active (moxifloxacin)- controlled study at single doses of 10, 20, 30, and 50 mcg. Dose-dependent QtcI (individual subject corrected QT interval) prolongation was observed. The maximum mean (one-sided 95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcI from placebo after baseline correction was 2.5 (5.6) ms, 6.1 (9.2) ms, 7.5 (10.7) ms, and 8.5 (11.6) ms following doses of 10, 20, 30, and 50 mcg, respectively. The effect of 5 mcg and 10 mcg olodaterol on heart rate and rhythm was assessed using continuous 24-hour ECG recording (Holter monitoring) in a subset of 772 patients in the 48-week, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials. There were no dose- or time-related trends or patterns observed for the magnitudes of mean changes in heart rate or premature beats. Shifts from baseline to the end of treatment in premature beats did not indicate meaningful differences between olodaterol 5 mcg, 10 mcg, and placebo. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics STIOLTO RESPIMAT When STIOLTO RESPIMAT was administered by the inhalation route, the pharmacokinetic parameters for tiotropium and for olodaterol were similar to those observed when each active substance was administered separately. Tiotropium Tiotropium is administered as an inhalation spray. Some of the pharmacokinetic data described below were obtained with higher doses than recommended for therapy. Olodaterol Olodaterol showed linear pharmacokinetics. On repeated once-daily inhalation, steady-state of olodaterol plasma concentrations was achieved after 8 days, and the extent of exposure was increased up to 1.8-fold as compared to a single dose. Absorption Tiotropium Following inhalation of the solution by young healthy volunteers, urinary excretion data suggests that approximately 33% of the inhaled dose reaches the systemic circulation. Oral solutions of tiotropium have an absolute bioavailability of 2% to 3%. Food is not expected to influence the absorption of tiotropium for the same reason. Maximum tiotropium plasma concentrations were observed 5 to 7 minutes after inhalation. Olodaterol Olodaterol reaches maximum plasma concentrations generally within 10 to 20 minutes following drug inhalation. In healthy volunteers the absolute bioavailability of olodaterol following inhalation was estimated to be approximately 30%, whereas the absolute bioavailability was below 1% when given as an oral solution. Thus, the systemic availability of olodaterol after inhalation is mainly determined by lung absorption, while any swallowed portion of the dose only negligibly contributes to systemic exposure. Distribution Tiotropium The drug has a plasma protein binding of 72% and shows a volume of distribution of 32 L/kg. Local concentrations in the lung are not known, but the mode of administration suggests substantially higher concentrations in the lung. Studies in rats have shown that tiotropium does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Olodaterol Olodaterol exhibits multi-compartmental disposition kinetics after inhalation as well as after intravenous administration. The volume of distribution is high (1,110 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissue. In vitro binding of [ 14 C] olodaterol to human plasma proteins is independent of concentration and is approximately 60%. Elimination Metabolism Tiotropium The extent of metabolism is small. This is evident from a urinary excretion of 74% of unchanged substance after an intravenous dose to young healthy volunteers. Tiotropium, an ester, is nonenzymatically cleaved to the alcohol N-methylscopine and dithienylglycolic acid, both not binding to muscarinic receptors. In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes suggest that a fraction of the administered dose (74% of an intravenous dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, leaving 25% for metabolism) is metabolized by cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation and subsequent glutathione conjugation to a variety of Phase 2 metabolites. This enzymatic pathway can be inhibited by CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors, such as quinidine, ketoconazole, and gestodene. Thus, CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 are involved in the metabolic pathway that is responsible for the elimination of a small part of the administered dose. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that tiotropium in supra-therapeutic concentrations does not inhibit CYP450 1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. Olodaterol Olodaterol is substantially metabolized by direct glucuronidation and by O-demethylation at the methoxy moiety followed by conjugation. Of the six metabolites identified, only the unconjugated demethylation product binds to beta 2 -receptors. This metabolite, however, is not detectable in plasma after chronic inhalation of the recommended therapeutic dose. Cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C8, with negligible contribution of CYP3A4, are involved in the O-demethylation of olodaterol, while uridine diphosphate glycosyl transferase isoforms UGT2B7, UGT1A1, 1A7, and 1A9 were shown to be involved in the formation of olodaterol glucuronides. Excretion Tiotropium The terminal half-life of tiotropium in COPD patients following once daily inhalation of 5 mcg tiotropium was approximately 25 hours. Total clearance was 880 mL/min after an intravenous dose in young healthy volunteers. Intravenously administered tiotropium bromide is mainly excreted unchanged in urine (74%). After inhalation of the solution by patients with COPD, urinary excretion is 18.6% (0.932 mcg) of the dose, the remainder being mainly non-absorbed drug in the gut that is eliminated via the feces. The renal clearance of tiotropium exceeds the creatinine clearance, indicating secretion into the urine. After chronic once-daily inhalation by COPD patients, pharmacokinetic steady state was reached by day 7 with no accumulation thereafter. Olodaterol Total clearance of olodaterol in healthy volunteers is 872 mL/min, and renal clearance is 173 mL/min. The terminal half-life following intravenous administration is 22 hours. The terminal half-life following inhalation in contrast is about 45 hours, indicating that the latter is determined by absorption rather than by elimination processes. However, the effective half-life at daily dose of 5 mcg calculated from C max from COPD patients is 7.5 hours. Following intravenous administration of [ 14 C]-labeled olodaterol, 38% of the radioactive dose was recovered in the urine and 53% was recovered in feces. The amount of unchanged olodaterol recovered in the urine after intravenous administration was 19%. Following oral administration, only 9% of olodaterol and/or its metabolites was recovered in urine, while the major portion was recovered in feces (84%). More than 90% of the dose was excreted within 6 and 5 days following intravenous and oral administration, respectively. Following inhalation, excretion of unchanged olodaterol in urine within the dosing interval in healthy volunteers at steady state accounted for 5% to 7% of the dose. Drug Interactions STIOLTO RESPIMAT Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with STIOLTO RESPIMAT have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with individual components tiotropium and olodaterol. When tiotropium and olodaterol were administered in combination by the inhaled route, the pharmacokinetic parameters for each component were similar to those observed when each active substance was administered separately. Tiotropium An interaction study with tiotropium (14.4 mcg intravenous infusion over 15 minutes) and cimetidine 400 mg three times daily or ranitidine 300 mg once-daily was conducted. Concomitant administration of cimetidine with tiotropium resulted in a 20% increase in the AUC 0-4h , a 28% decrease in the renal clearance of tiotropium and no significant change in the C max and amount excreted in urine over 96 hours. Co-administration of tiotropium with ranitidine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium. Common concomitant medications (long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)) used by patients with COPD were not found to alter the exposure to tiotropium. Olodaterol Drug-drug interaction studies were carried out using fluconazole as a model inhibitor of CYP 2C9 and ketoconazole as a potent P-gp (and CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9) inhibitor. Fluconazole : Co-administration of 400 mg fluconazole once a day for 14 days had no relevant effect on systemic exposure to olodaterol. Ketoconazole : Co-administration of 400 mg ketoconazole once a day for 14 days increased olodaterol C max by 66% and AUC 0-1 by 68%. Tiotropium : Co-administration of tiotropium bromide, delivered as a fixed-dose combination with olodaterol, for 21 days had no relevant effect on systemic exposure to olodaterol, and vice versa. Specific Populations Olodaterol A pharmacokinetic meta-analysis showed that no dose adjustment is necessary based on the effect of age, gender, and weight on systemic exposure in COPD patients after inhalation of olodaterol. Geriatric Patients Tiotropium: As expected for all predominantly renally excreted drugs, advancing age was associated with a decrease of tiotropium renal clearance (347 mL/min in COPD patients <65 years to 275 mL/min in COPD patients \u226565 years). This did not result in a corresponding increase in AUC 0-6,ss and C max,ss values. Renal Impairment Tiotropium Following inhaled administration of therapeutic doses of tiotropium to steady-state to patients with COPD, mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 - <90 mL/min) resulted in 23% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 17% higher C max,ss values. Moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 - <60 mL/min) resulted in 57% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 31% higher C max,ss values compared to COPD patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance \u226590 mL/min). In COPD patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR <30 mL/min), a single intravenous administration of tiotropium bromide resulted in 94% higher AUC 0-4 and 52% higher C max compared to COPD patients with normal renal function. Olodaterol Olodaterol levels were increased by approximately 40% in subjects with severe renal impairment. A study in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment was not performed. Hepatic Impairment Tiotropium The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium were not studied. Olodaterol Subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed no changes in C max or AUC, nor did protein binding differ between mild and moderate hepatically impaired subjects and their healthy controls.

Fluticasone Propionate One active component of this product is fluticasone propionate, a corticosteroid having the chemical name S -(fluoromethyl) 6\u03b1,9-difluoro-11\u00df,17-dihydroxy-16\u03b1-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-17\u00df-carbothioate, 17-propionate, and the following chemical structure: Fluticasone propionate is a white powder with a molecular weight of 500.6, and the empirical formula is C 25 H 31 F 3 O 5 S. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide, and slightly soluble in methanol and 95% ethanol. Salmeterol Xinafoate The other active component of this product is salmeterol xinafoate, a beta 2 \u2013adrenergic bronchodilator. Salmeterol xinafoate is the racemic form of the 1\u2011hydroxy\u20112\u2011naphthoic acid salt of salmeterol. It has the chemical name 4-hydroxy-\u03b1 -[[[6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexyl]amino]methyl]-1,3-benzenedimethanol, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthalenecarboxylate and the following chemical structure: Salmeterol xinafoate is a white powder with a molecular weight of 603.8, and the empirical formula is C 25 H 37 NO 4 \u2022C 11 H 8 O 3 . It is freely soluble in methanol; slightly soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and isopropanol; and sparingly soluble in water. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is a multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) for oral inhalation only. It contains fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate, and lactose monohydrate (which may contain milk proteins). The opening of the mouthpiece cover meters 5.5 mg of the formulation from the device reservoir, which contains 55 mcg, 113 mcg, or 232 mcg of fluticasone propionate, and 14 mcg of salmeterol base (equivalent to 20.3 mcg of salmeterol xinafoate). Patient inhalation through the mouthpiece causes the deagglomeration and aerosolization of the drug particles as the formulation moves through the cyclone component of the device. This is followed by dispersion into the airstream. Under standardized in vitro test conditions, the Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI delivers 49 mcg, 100 mcg, or 202 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 12.75 mcg of salmeterol base (equivalent to 18.5 mcg of salmeterol xinafoate), with lactose from the mouthpiece when tested at a flow rate of 85 L/min for 1.4 seconds. The amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors such as inspiratory flow profiles. In adult subjects (N=50, aged 18 to 45 years) with asthma, mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI was 108.28 L/min (range: 70.37 to 129.24 L/min). In adolescent subjects (N=50, aged 12 to 17 years) with asthma, mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI was 106.72 L/min (range: 73.64 to 125.51 L/min)."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action This product contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol. The mechanisms of action described below for the individual components apply to this combination product. These drugs represent 2 different classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a LABA) that have different effects on clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory indices. Fluticasone Propionate : Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in humans are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in the treatment of asthma. Salmeterol : Salmeterol is a selective LABA. In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta 2 \u2011adrenoceptors than albuterol. Although beta 2 \u2011adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta 1 \u2011adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta 2 \u2011adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta\u2011adrenoceptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta 2 \u2011agonists may have cardiac effects. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2 \u2011adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including salmeterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3\u2032,5\u2032-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. In vitro tests show that salmeterol is a potent and long\u2011lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D 2 , from human lung. Salmeterol inhibits histamine\u2011induced plasma protein extravasation and inhibits platelet\u2011activating factor\u2011induced eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of guinea pigs when administered by the inhaled route. In humans, single doses of salmeterol administered via inhalation aerosol attenuate allergen\u2011induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal Axis Effects (HPA) There are no HPA data from controlled trials of the Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI in healthy subjects or subjects with asthma. Cardiovascular Effects and Effects on Potassium and Glucose Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI in Healthy Subjects There were no clinical trials conducted with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI that assessed cardiovascular (CV) effects in healthy subjects. Other Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) Products in Healthy Subjects Since systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol are not normally seen at the maximum approved salmeterol dosage, higher doses were used to produce measurable effects. Four trials were conducted with healthy adult subjects to assess CV effects: Single\u2011dose crossover trial using 2 inhalations of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol DPI (500 mcg/50 mcg) (two times the maximum approved salmeterol dosage for that DPI per dosing interval), fluticasone propionate DPI 500 mcg and salmeterol DPI 50 mcg given concurrently, or fluticasone propionate DPI 500 mcg given alone, Cumulative dose trial using 50 to 400 mcg of salmeterol DPI (1 time to 8 times the maximum approved salmeterol dosage per dosing interval for that DPI, respectively) given alone, or fluticasone propionate and salmeterol DPI (500 mcg/50 mcg), Repeat\u2011dose trial for 11 days using 2 inhalations twice daily of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol DPI (250 mcg/50 mcg) (two times the maximum approved salmeterol dosage for that DPI per dosing interval), fluticasone propionate DPI 250 mcg, or salmeterol DPI 50 mcg, and Single-dose trial using 5 inhalations of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol DPI (100 mcg/50 mcg) (five times the maximum approved salmeterol dosage for that DPI per dosing interval), fluticasone propionate DPI 100 mcg alone, or placebo. In these trials, no significant differences were observed in the pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol (pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, potassium, and glucose) whether the salmeterol was given as fluticasone propionate and salmeterol DPI, concurrently with fluticasone propionate from separate inhalers, or as salmeterol alone. The systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol were not altered by the presence of fluticasone propionate in the fluticasone propionate and salmeterol DPI product. Other Salmeterol Products in Subjects with Asthma: Inhaled salmeterol, like other beta\u2011adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce dose\u2011related CV effects and effects on blood glucose and/or serum potassium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 , 5.17 )] . The CV effects (heart rate, blood pressure) associated with salmeterol inhalation aerosol occurred with similar frequency, and are of similar type and severity, as those noted following albuterol administration. The effects of rising inhaled doses of salmeterol and standard inhaled doses of albuterol were studied in volunteers and in subjects with asthma. Salmeterol doses up to 84 mcg administered as inhalation aerosol resulted in heart rate increases of 3 to 16 beats/minute, about the same as albuterol dosed at 180 mcg by inhalation aerosol (4 to 10 beats/minute). Adult and adolescent subjects receiving 50 mcg doses of salmeterol MDPI (N=60) underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during two 12\u2011hour periods after the first dose and after 1 month of therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted. Concomitant Use of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI With Other Respiratory Medications: Short-Acting Beta 2 \u2011Agonists: In clinical trials in subjects with asthma, the mean daily need for albuterol by 166 adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older using another fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DPI product was approximately 1.3 inhalations/day and ranged from 0 to 9 inhalations/day (0 to about 4.5 times the maximum approved salmeterol dosage for that DPI per dosing interval). Five percent (5%) of subjects using another fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DPI product in these trials averaged 6 or more inhalations per day (3 times the maximum approved salmeterol dosage for that DPI per dosing interval) over the course of the 12-week trials. No increase in frequency of CV adverse events was observed among subjects who averaged 6 or more inhalations per day. Methylxanthines: In clinical trials in subjects with asthma, 39 subjects receiving another fluticasone propionate/salmeterol MDPI product, fluticasone propionate 100 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg, fluticasone propionate 250 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg, or fluticasone propionate 500 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily concurrently with a theophylline product had adverse event rates similar to those in 304 subjects receiving another fluticasone propionate/salmeterol product without theophylline. Similar results were observed in subjects receiving salmeterol 50 mcg plus fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily concurrently with a theophylline product (n = 39) or without theophylline (n = 132). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels may not predict therapeutic effect. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate was negligible (<1%), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. In contrast, the majority of the fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung was systemically absorbed. After administration of 232 mcg/14 mcg Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI to patients aged 12 years and older with persistent asthma in a clinical trial, the mean C max value of fluticasone propionate was 66 pg/mL with a median t max value of approximately 2 hours. Salmeterol: After administration of 232 mcg/14 mcg Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI to patients aged 12 years and older with persistent asthma, the mean C max values of salmeterol was 60 pg/mL. The median t max was 5 minutes. Distribution Fluticasone Propionate: Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averages 99%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Salmeterol: Volume of distribution data are not available for salmeterol. The percentage of salmeterol bound to human plasma proteins averages 96% in vitro over the concentration range of 8 to 7,722 ng of salmeterol base per milliliter, much higher concentrations than those achieved following therapeutic doses of salmeterol. Elimination Fluticasone Propionate: Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Terminal half-life estimates of fluticasone propionate following oral inhalation administration of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI were approximately 10.8 hours. Metabolism The total clearance of fluticasone propionate is high (average, 1,093 mL/minute), with renal clearance accounting for less than 0.02% of the total. The only circulating metabolite detected in humans is the 17\u03b2 carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This metabolite has less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in humans. Excretion Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Salmeterol : Terminal half-life estimates for salmeterol for Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI were approximately 12.6 hours. The xinafoate moiety has no apparent pharmacologic activity. The xinafoate moiety is highly protein bound (greater than 99%) and has a long elimination half-life of 11 days. Metabolism Salmeterol base is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation. An in vitro study using human liver microsomes showed that salmeterol is extensively metabolized to \u03b1 hydroxysalmeterol (aliphatic oxidation) by CYP3A4. Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, essentially completely inhibited the formation of \u03b1 hydroxysalmeterol in vitro. Excretion In 2 healthy adult subjects who received 1 mg of radiolabeled salmeterol (as salmeterol xinafoate) orally, approximately 25% and 60% of the radiolabeled salmeterol was eliminated in urine and feces, respectively, over a period of 7 days. Specific Populations A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol utilizing data from 9 controlled clinical trials that included 350 subjects with asthma aged 4 to 77 years who received treatment with another fluticasone propionate and salmeterol MDPI product, the combination of HFA\u2011propelled fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation aerosol, fluticasone propionate MDPI, HFA\u2011propelled fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol, or CFC\u2011propelled fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. The population pharmacokinetic analyses for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol showed no clinically relevant effects of age, gender, race, body weight, body mass index, or percent of predicted FEV 1 on apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is not approved in pediatric patients younger than 12 years. Age: No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI in geriatric patients. Adolescents Aged 12 to 17 Years: A subgroup analysis was conducted to compare patients aged 12 to 17 (n=15) and \u226518 (n=23) years following administration of 232 mcg/14 mcg Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. No overall differences in fluticasone propionate and salmeterol pharmacokinetics were observed. Male and Female Patients: A subgroup analysis was conducted to compare male (n=21) and female (n=16) adolescent and adult patients following administration of 232 mcg/14 mcg Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. No overall differences in fluticasone propionate and salmeterol pharmacokinetics were observed. Patients with Renal Impairment : The effect of renal impairment of the pharmacokinetics of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI has not been evaluated. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Formal pharmacokinetic studies using Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. However, since both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol are predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol in plasma [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interaction Studies In a single-dose trial, the presence of salmeterol did not alter fluticasone propionate exposure. No studies have been performed with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI to investigate the effect of fluticasone propionate on salmeterol pharmacokinetics when given in combination. Drug Interaction Studies with Another Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI Product : The population pharmacokinetic analysis from 9 controlled clinical trials in 350 subjects with asthma showed no significant effects on fluticasone propionate or salmeterol pharmacokinetics following co-administration with beta 2 -agonists, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or theophyllines. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range: 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC 0-\u03c4 averaged 8.43 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022h/mL). However, the fluticasone propionate C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increased to 318 pg/mL (range: 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022h/mL), respectively, after 7 days of coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily). This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in serum cortisol AUC. Ketoconazole: In a placebo-controlled crossover trial in 8 healthy adult volunteers, coadministration of a single dose of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) with multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg) to steady state resulted in increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, a reduction in plasma cortisol AUC, and no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. In a placebo-controlled, crossover drug interaction trial in 20 healthy male and female subjects, coadministration of salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure as determined by a 16-fold increase in AUC (ratio with and without ketoconazole 15.76 [90% CI: 10.66, 23.31]) mainly due to increased bioavailability of the swallowed portion of the dose. Peak plasma salmeterol concentrations were increased by 1.4-fold (90% CI: 1.23, 1.68). Three (3) out of 20 subjects (15%) were withdrawn from salmeterol and ketoconazole coadministration due to beta-agonist-mediated systemic effects (2 with QTc prolongation and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole did not result in a clinically significant effect on mean heart rate, mean blood potassium, or mean blood glucose. Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol administration alone and placebo administration. Erythromycin: In a multiple-dose drug interaction trial, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg 3 times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. In a repeat-dose trial in 13 healthy subjects, concomitant administration of erythromycin (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) and salmeterol inhalation aerosol resulted in a 40% increase in salmeterol C max at steady state (ratio with and without erythromycin 1.4 [90% CI: 0.96, 2.03], P = 0.12), a 3.6-beat/min increase in heart rate ([95% CI: 0.19, 7.03], P<0.04), a 5.8-msec increase in QTc interval ([95% CI: -6.14, 17.77], P = 0.34), and no change in plasma potassium."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bryant Ranch Prepack"], "substance_name": ["FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE", "SALMETEROL XINAFOATE"], "effective_time": "20240404", "product_ndc": ["63629-8811"], "brand_name": ["Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol"]}

The active component of FLOVENT DISKUS 50 mcg, FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg, and FLOVENT DISKUS 250 mcg is fluticasone propionate, a corticosteroid having the chemical name S- (fluoromethyl) 6\u03b1,9-difluoro-11\u03b2,17-dihydroxy-16\u03b1-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-17\u03b2-carbothioate, 17-propionate and the following chemical structure: Fluticasone propionate is a white powder with a molecular weight of 500.6, and the empirical formula is C 25 H 31 F 3 O 5 S. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide, and slightly soluble in methanol and 95% ethanol. FLOVENT DISKUS is an orange plastic inhaler containing a foil blister strip. Each blister on the strip contains a white powder mix of micronized fluticasone propionate (50, 100, or 250 mcg) in 12.5 mg of formulation containing lactose monohydrate (which contains milk proteins). After the inhaler is activated, the powder is dispersed into the airstream created by the patient inhaling through the mouthpiece. Under standardized in vitro test conditions, FLOVENT DISKUS delivers 46, 94, and 229 mcg of fluticasone propionate from FLOVENT DISKUS 50 mcg, FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg, and FLOVENT DISKUS 250 mcg, respectively, when tested at a flow rate of 60 L/min for 2 seconds. In adult subjects with obstructive lung disease and severely compromised lung function (mean FEV 1 20% to 30% of predicted), mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the DISKUS inhaler was 82.4 L/min (range: 46.1 to 115.3 L/min). In children with asthma aged 4 and 8 years, mean PIF through FLOVENT DISKUS was 70 and 104 L/min, respectively (range: 48 to 123 L/min). The actual amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors, such as inspiratory flow profile. Chemical structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When corticosteroids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer. Trials in subjects with asthma have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects with recommended doses of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, negligible oral systemic bioavailability (<1%), and the minimal pharmacological activity of the only metabolite detected in man. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using dosages up to and including 250 mcg twice daily, occasional abnormal short cosyntropin tests (peak serum cortisol <18 mcg/dL assessed by radioimmunoassay) were noted both in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and in subjects receiving placebo. The incidence of abnormal tests at 500 mcg twice daily was greater than placebo. In a 2-year trial carried out with the DISKHALER inhalation device in 64 subjects with mild, persistent asthma (mean FEV 1 91% of predicted) randomized to fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily or placebo, no subject receiving fluticasone propionate had an abnormal response to 6-hour cosyntropin infusion (peak serum cortisol <18 mcg/dL). With a peak cortisol threshold of <35 mcg/dL, 1 subject receiving fluticasone propionate (4%) had an abnormal response at 1 year; repeat testing at 18 months and 2 years was normal. Another subject receiving fluticasone propionate (5%) had an abnormal response at 2 years. No subject on placebo had an abnormal response at 1 or 2 years. In a placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in subjects aged 4 to 11 years, a 30-minute cosyntropin stimulation test was performed in 41 subjects after 12 weeks of dosing with 50 or 100 mcg twice daily of fluticasone propionate via the DISKUS inhaler. One subject receiving fluticasone propionate via the DISKUS inhaler had a prestimulation plasma cortisol concentration <5 mcg/dL, and 2 subjects had a rise in cortisol of <7 mcg/dL. However, all poststimulation values were >18 mcg/dL. The potential systemic effects of inhaled fluticasone propionate on the HPA axis were also studied in subjects with asthma. Fluticasone propionate given by inhalation aerosol at dosages of 220, 440, 660, or 880 mcg twice daily was compared with placebo or oral prednisone 10 mg given once daily for 4 weeks. For most subjects, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by 6-hour cosyntropin stimulation, remained intact with inhaled fluticasone propionate treatment. No subject had an abnormal response (peak serum cortisol <18 mcg/dL) after dosing with placebo or fluticasone propionate 220 mcg twice daily. For subjects treated with 440, 660, and 880 mcg twice daily, 10%, 16%, and 12%, respectively, had an abnormal response as compared with 29% of subjects treated with prednisone. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluticasone propionate acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate is negligible (<1%), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. In contrast, the majority of the fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung is systemically absorbed. The absolute bioavailability of fluticasone propionate from the DISKUS inhaler in healthy volunteers averages 7.8%. Peak steady-state fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations in adult subjects with asthma (N = 11) ranged from undetectable to 266 pg/mL after a 500-mcg twice-daily dose of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using the DISKUS inhaler. The mean fluticasone propionate plasma concentration was 110 pg/mL. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averages 99%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Metabolism The total clearance of fluticasone propionate is high (average, 1,093 mL/min), with renal clearance accounting for <0.02% of the total. The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Elimination Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Specific Populations Male and Female Patients: Full pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained from 9 female and 16 male subjects given 500 mcg twice daily. No overall differences in fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics were observed. Pediatric Patients: In a clinical trial conducted in subjects aged 4 to 11 years with mild to moderate asthma, fluticasone propionate concentrations were obtained in 61 subjects at 20 and 40 minutes after dosing with 50 and 100 mcg twice daily of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using the DISKUS. Plasma concentrations were low and ranged from undetectable (about 80% of the plasma samples) to 88 pg/mL. Mean peak fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations at the 50- and 100-mcg dose levels were 5 and 8 pg/mL, respectively. Patients with Hepatic and Renal Impairment: Formal pharmacokinetic studies using FLOVENT DISKUS have not been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, since fluticasone propionate is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. Drug Interaction Studies Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4: Ritonavir: Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range: 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC (0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022h/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC (0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range: 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022h/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in serum cortisol AUC. Ketoconazole: In a placebo-controlled, crossover trial in 8 healthy adult volunteers, coadministration of a single dose of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) with multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg) to steady state resulted in increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, a reduction in plasma cortisol AUC, and no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. Following orally inhaled fluticasone propionate alone, AUC (2-last) averaged 1.559 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 0.555 to 2.906 ng\u2022h/mL) and AUC (2-\u221e) averaged 2.269 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 0.836 to 3.707 ng\u2022h/mL). Fluticasone propionate AUC (2-last) and AUC (2-\u221e) increased to 2.781 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 2.489 to 8.486 ng\u2022h/mL) and 4.317 ng\u2022h/mL (range: 3.256 to 9.408 ng\u2022h/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ketoconazole with orally inhaled fluticasone propionate. This increase in plasma fluticasone propionate concentration resulted in a decrease (45%) in serum cortisol AUC.

Albuterol Sulfate chemical structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on beta 2 -adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. Although beta 2 -adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta 1 -adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta 2 -adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta 2 -agonists may have cardiac effects. Activation of beta 2 -adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenyl cyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3\u2032,5\u2032-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). This increase of cyclic AMP leads to the activation of protein kinase A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in relaxation. Albuterol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles. Albuterol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway. Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects. Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The systemic levels of albuterol are low after inhalation of recommended doses. A trial conducted in 12 healthy male and female subjects using a higher dose (1,080 mcg of albuterol base) showed that mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3 ng/mL occurred after dosing when albuterol was delivered using propellant HFA-134a.

Sevoflurane is a clear, colorless, liquid containing no additives. Sevoflurane is not corrosive to stainless steel, brass, aluminum, nickel-plated brass, chrome-plated brass or copper beryllium. Sevoflurane is nonpungent. It is miscible with ethanol, ether, chloroform and benzene, and it is slightly soluble in water. Sevoflurane is stable when stored under normal room lighting conditions according to instructions. No discernible degradation of sevoflurane occurs in the presence of strong acids or heat. When in contact with alkaline CO 2 absorbents (e.g., Baralyme \u00ae and to a lesser extent soda lime) within the anesthesia machine, sevoflurane can undergo degradation under certain conditions. Degradation of sevoflurane is minimal, and degradants are either undetectable or present in non-toxic amounts when used as directed with fresh absorbents. Sevoflurane degradation and subsequent degradant formation are enhanced by increasing absorbent temperature increased sevoflurane concentration, decreased fresh gas flow and desiccated CO 2 absorbents (especially with potassium hydroxide containing absorbents e.g., Baralyme). Sevoflurane alkaline degradation occurs by two pathways. The first results from the loss of hydrogen fluoride with the formation of pentafluoroisopropenyl fluoromethyl ether, (PIFE, C 4 H 2 F 6 O), also known as Compound A, and trace amounts of pentafluoromethoxy isopropyl fluoromethyl ether, (PMFE, C 5 H 6 F 6 O), also known as Compound B. The second pathway for degradation of sevoflurane, which occurs primarily in the presence of desiccated CO 2 absorbents, is discussed later. In the first pathway, the defluorination pathway, the production of degradants in the anesthesia circuit results from the extraction of the acidic proton in the presence of a strong base (KOH and/or NaOH) forming an alkene (Compound A) from sevoflurane similar to formation of 2- bromo-2-chloro-1,1-difluoro ethylene (BCDFE) from halothane. Laboratory simulations have shown that the concentration of these degradants is inversely correlated with the fresh gas flow rate (See Figure 1). Since the reaction of carbon dioxide with absorbents is exothermic, the temperature increase will be determined by quantities of CO 2 absorbed, which in turn will depend on fresh gas flow in the anesthesia circle system, metabolic status of the patient, and ventilation. The relationship of temperature produced by varying levels of CO 2 and Compound A production is illustrated in the following in vitro simulation where CO 2 was added to a circle absorber system. Compound A concentration in a circle absorber system increases as a function of increasing CO 2 absorbent temperature and composition (Baralyme producing higher levels than soda lime), increased body temperature, and increased minute ventilation, and decreasing fresh gas flow rates. It has been reported that the concentration of Compound A increases significantly with prolonged dehydration of Baralyme. Compound A exposure in patients also has been shown to rise with increased sevoflurane concentrations and duration of anesthesia. In a clinical study in which sevoflurane was administered to patients under low flow conditions for \u2265 2 hours at flow rates of 1 Liter/minute, Compound A levels were measured in an effort to determine the relationship between MAC hours and Compound A levels produced. The relationship between Compound A levels and sevoflurane exposure are shown in Figure 2a. Compound A has been shown to be nephrotoxic in rats after exposures that have varied in duration from one to three hours. No histopathologic change was seen at a concentration of up to 270 ppm for one hour. Sporadic single cell necrosis of proximal tubule cells has been reported at a concentration of 114 ppm after a 3-hour exposure to Compound A in rats. The LC 50 reported at 1 hour is 1050 - 1090 ppm (male-female) and, at 3 hours, 350-490 ppm (male-female). An experiment was performed comparing sevoflurane plus 75 or 100 ppm Compound A with an active control to evaluate the potential nephrotoxicity of Compound A in non-human primates. A single 8-hour exposure of Sevoflurane in the presence of Compound A produced single-cell renal tubular degeneration and single-cell necrosis in cynomolgus monkeys. These changes are consistent with the increased urinary protein, glucose level and enzymic activity noted on days one and three on the clinical pathology evaluation. This nephrotoxicity produced by Compound A is dose and duration of exposure dependent. At a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L/min, mean maximum concentrations of Compound A in the anesthesia circuit in clinical settings are approximately 20 ppm (0.002%) with soda lime and 30 ppm (0.003%) with Baralyme in adult patients; mean maximum concentrations in pediatric patients with soda lime are about half those found in adults. The highest concentration observed in a single patient with Baralyme was 61 ppm (0.0061%) and 32 ppm (0.0032%) with soda lime. The levels of Compound A at which toxicity occurs in humans is not known. The second pathway for degradation of sevoflurane occurs primarily in the presence of desiccated CO 2 absorbents and leads to the dissociation of sevoflurane into hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and formaldehyde. HFIP is inactive, non-genotoxic, rapidly glucuronidated and cleared by the liver. Formaldehyde is present during normal metabolic processes. Upon exposure to a highly desiccated absorbent, formaldehyde can further degrade into methanol and formate. Formate can contribute to the formation of carbon monoxide in the presence of high temperature that can be associated with desiccated Baralyme. Methanol can react with Compound A to form the methoxy addition product Compound B. Compound B can undergo further HF elimination to form Compounds C, D, and E. Sevoflurane degradants were observed in the respiratory circuit of an experimental anesthesia machine using desiccated CO 2 absorbents and maximum sevoflurane concentrations (8%) for extended periods of time (> 2 hours). Concentrations of formaldehyde observed with desiccated soda lime in this experimental anesthesia respiratory circuit were consistent with levels that could potentially result in respiratory irritation. Although KOH containing CO 2 absorbents are no longer commercially available, in the laboratory experiments, exposure of sevoflurane to the desiccated KOH containing CO 2 absorbent, Baralyme, resulted in the detection of substantially greater degradant levels."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sevoflurane is an inhalational anesthetic agent for use in induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane in oxygen for a 40-year-old adult is 2.1%. The MAC of sevoflurane decreases with age (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for details). Pharmacokinetics Uptake and Distribution Solubility Because of the low solubility of sevoflurane in blood (blood/gas partition coefficient @ 37\u00b0C = 0.63- 0.69), a minimal amount of sevoflurane is required to be dissolved in the blood before the alveolar partial pressure is in equilibrium with the arterial partial pressure. Therefore, there is a rapid rate of increase in the alveolar (end-tidal) concentration (F A ) toward the inspired concentration (F I ) during induction. Induction of Anesthesia In a study in which seven healthy male volunteers were administered 70% N 2 O/30% O 2 for 30 minutes followed by 1.0% sevoflurane and 0.6% isoflurane for another 30 minutes the F A /F I ratio was greater for sevoflurane than isoflurane at all time points. The time for the concentration in the alveoli to reach 50% of the inspired concentration was 4 - 8 minutes for isoflurane and approximately 1 minute for sevoflurane. F A /F I data from this study were compared with F A /F I data of other halogenated anesthetic agents from another study. When all data were normalized to isoflurane, the uptake and distribution of sevoflurane was shown to be faster than isoflurane and halothane, but slower than desflurane. The results are depicted in Figure 3. Recovery from Anesthesia The low solubility of sevoflurane facilitates rapid elimination via the lungs. The rate of elimination is quantified as the rate of change of the alveolar (end-tidal) concentration following termination of anesthesia (F A ), relative to the last alveolar concentration (FaO) measured immediately before discontinuance of the anesthetic. In the healthy volunteer study described above, rate of elimination of sevoflurane was similar compared with desflurane, but faster compared with either halothane or isoflurane. These results are depicted in Figure 4. Protein Binding The effects of sevoflurane on the displacement of drugs from serum and tissue proteins have not been investigated. Other fluorinated volatile anesthetics have been shown to displace drugs from serum and tissue proteins in vitro . The clinical significance of this is unknown. Clinical studies have shown no untoward effects when sevoflurane is administered to patients taking drugs that are highly bound and have a small volume of distribution (e.g., phenytoin). Metabolism Sevoflurane is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2E1, to hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) with release of inorganic fluoride and CO 2 . Once formed HFIP is rapidly conjugated with glucuronic acid and eliminated as a urinary metabolite. No other metabolic pathways for sevoflurane have been identified. In vivo metabolism studies suggest that approximately 5% of the sevoflurane dose may be metabolized. Cytochrome P450 2E1 is the principal isoform identified for sevoflurane metabolism and this may be induced by chronic exposure to isoniazid and ethanol. This is similar to the metabolism of isoflurane and enflurane and is distinct from that of methoxyflurane which is metabolized via a variety of cytochrome P450 isoforms. The metabolism of sevoflurane is not inducible by barbiturates. As shown in Figure 5, inorganic fluoride concentrations peak within 2 hours of the end of sevoflurane anesthesia and return to baseline concentrations within 48 hours post- anesthesia in the majority of cases (67%). The rapid and extensive pulmonary elimination of sevoflurane minimizes the amount of anesthetic available for metabolism. Elimination Up to 3.5% of the sevoflurane dose appears in the urine as inorganic fluoride. Studies on fluoride indicate that up to 50% of fluoride clearance is nonrenal (via fluoride being taken up into bone). Pharmacokinetics of Fluoride Ion Fluoride ion concentrations are influenced by the duration of anesthesia, the concentration of sevoflurane administered, and the composition of the anesthetic gas mixture. In studies where anesthesia was maintained purely with sevoflurane for periods ranging from 1 to 6 hours, peak fluoride concentrations ranged between 12 \u03bcM and 90 \u03bcM. As shown in Figure 6, peak concentrations occur within 2 hours of the end of anesthesia and are less than 25 \u03bcM (475 ng/mL) for the majority of the population after 10 hours. The half-life is in the range of 15-23 hours. It has been reported that following administration of methoxyflurane, serum inorganic fluoride concentrations > 50 \u03bcM were correlated with the development of vasopressin-resistant, polyuric, renal failure. In clinical studies with sevoflurane, there were no reports of toxicity associated with elevated fluoride ion levels. Fluoride Concentrations After Repeat Exposure and in Special Populations Fluoride concentrations have been measured after single, extended, and repeat exposure to sevoflurane in normal surgical and special patient populations, and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. Compared with healthy individuals, the fluoride ion half-life was prolonged in patients with renal impairment, but not in the elderly. A study in 8 patients with hepatic impairment suggests a slight prolongation of the half-life. The mean half-life in patients with renal impairment averaged approximately 33 hours (range 21-61 hours) as compared to a mean of approximately 21 hours (range 10- 48 hours) in normal healthy individuals. The mean half-life in the elderly (greater than 65 years) approximated 24 hours (range 18-72 hours). The mean half-life in individuals with hepatic impairment was 23 hours (range 16-47 hours). Mean maximal fluoride values (C max ) determined in individual studies of special populations are displayed below. Table 1.

Cardiovascular Effects Sevoflurane was studied in 14 healthy volunteers (18 - 35 years old) comparing sevoflurane-O 2 (Sevo/O 2 ) to sevoflurane- N 2 O/O 2 (Sevo/ N 2 O/O 2 ) during 7 hours of anesthesia. During controlled ventilation, hemodynamic parameters measured are shown in Figures 7 - 10: Sevoflurane is a dose-related cardiac depressant. Sevoflurane does not produce increases in heart rate at doses less than 2 MAC. A study investigating the epinephrine induced arrhythmogenic effect of sevoflurane versus isoflurane in adult patients undergoing transsphenoidal hypophysectomy demonstrated that the threshold dose of epinephrine (i.e., the dose at which the first sign of arrhythmia was observed) producing multiple ventricular arrhythmias was 5 mcg/kg with both sevoflurane and isoflurane. Consequently, the interaction of sevoflurane with epinephrine appears to be equal to that seen with isoflurane. Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes, and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving volatile anesthetic agents, including sevoflurane. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS - Malignant Hyperthermia )."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bryant Ranch Prepack"], "substance_name": ["SEVOFLURANE"], "effective_time": "20240129", "product_ndc": ["72162-2245"], "brand_name": ["Sevoflurane"]}

Arformoterol is a selective beta 2 -adrenergic bronchodilator. The chemical name for arformoterol tartrate is formamide, N-[2-hydroxy-5-[(1R)-1-hydroxy-2-[[(1R)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]-, (2R,3R)-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioate (1:1 salt), and its established structural formula is as follows: The molecular weight of arformoterol tartrate is 494.5 g/mol, and its molecular formula is C 19 H 24 N 2 O 4 \u2022C 4 H 6 O 6 (1:1 salt). It is a white to off-white solid that is slightly soluble in water. Arformoterol tartrate is the United States Adopted Name (USAN) for (R,R)-formoterol L-tartrate. Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution is supplied as 2 mL of arformoterol tartrate solution packaged in 2.1 mL unit-dose, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) unit-dose ampules. Each unit-dose ampule contains 15 mcg of arformoterol (equivalent to 22 mcg of arformoterol tartrate) in a sterile, isotonic saline solution (sodium chloride), pH-adjusted to 5.0 with citric acid and sodium citrate. Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution requires no dilution before administration by nebulization. Like all other nebulized treatments, the amount delivered to the lungs will depend upon patient factors, the nebulizer used, and compressor performance. Using the PARI LC \u00ae Plus nebulizer (with mouthpiece) connected to a PARI DURA NEB\u2122 3000 compressor under in vitro conditions, the mean delivered dose from the mouthpiece (% nominal) was approximately 4.1 mcg (27.6%) at a mean flow rate of 3.3 L/min. The mean nebulization time was 6 minutes or less. Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution should be administered from a standard jet nebulizer at adequate flow rates via face mask or mouthpiece. Patients should be carefully instructed on the correct use of this drug product (please refer to the accompanying Patient Information ). 1"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Arformoterol, the (R,R)-enantiomer of formoterol, is a selective long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist (beta 2 -agonist) that has two-fold greater potency than racemic formoterol (which contains both the (S,S) and (R,R)-enantiomers). The (S,S)-enantiomer is about 1,000-fold less potent as a beta 2 -agonist than the (R,R)-enantiomer. While it is recognized that beta 2 -receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta 1 -receptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, data indicate that there are also beta 2 -receptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective beta 2 -agonists may have cardiac effects. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including arformoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3\u2032,5\u2032-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased intracellular cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. In vitro tests show that arformoterol is an inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, from the human lung. Arformoterol also inhibits histamine-induced plasma albumin extravasation in anesthetized guinea pigs and inhibits allergen-induced eosinophil influx in dogs with airway hyper-responsiveness. The relevance of these in vitro and animal findings to humans is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic Safety and Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Relationships The predominant adverse effects of inhaled beta 2 -agonists occur as a result of excessive activation of systemic beta-adrenergic receptors. The most common adverse effects may include skeletal muscle tremor and cramps, insomnia, tachycardia, decreases in plasma potassium, and increases in plasma glucose. Effects on Serum Potassium and Serum Glucose Levels Changes in serum potassium and serum glucose were evaluated in a dose-ranging study of twice daily (5 mcg, 15 mcg, or 25 mcg; 215 patients with COPD) and once daily (15 mcg, 25 mcg, or 50 mcg; 191 patients with COPD) arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution in COPD patients. At 2 and 6 hours post dose at week 0 (after the first dose), mean changes in serum potassium ranging from 0 to -0.3 mEq/L were observed in the arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution groups with similar changes observed after 2 weeks of treatment. Changes in mean serum glucose levels, ranging from a decrease of 1.2 mg/dL to an increase of 32.8 mg/dL were observed for arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution dose groups at both 2 and 6 hours post dose, both after the first dose and 14 days of daily treatment. Electrophysiology The effect of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution on QT interval was evaluated in a dose-ranging study following multiple doses of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 5 mcg, 15 mcg, or 25 mcg twice daily or 15 mcg, 25 mcg, or 50 mcg once daily for 2 weeks in patients with COPD. ECG assessments were performed at baseline, time of peak plasma concentration and throughout the dosing interval. Different methods of correcting for heart rate were employed, including a subject-specific method and the Fridericia method. Relative to placebo, the mean change in subject-specific QTc averaged over the dosing interval ranged from -1.8 to 2.7 msec, indicating little effect of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution on cardiac repolarization after 2 weeks of treatment. The maximum mean change in subject-specific QTc for the arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily dose was 17.3 msec, compared with 15.4 msec in the placebo group. No apparent correlation of QTc with arformoterol plasma concentration was observed. Electrocardiographic Monitoring in Patients with COPD The effect of different doses of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution on cardiac rhythm was assessed using 24-hour Holter monitoring in two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 1,456 patients with COPD (873 received arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution at 15 or 25 mcg twice daily or 50 mcg once daily doses; 293 received placebo; 290 received salmeterol). The 24-hour Holter monitoring occurred once at baseline, and up to 3 times during the 12-week treatment period. The rates of new-onset cardiac arrhythmias not present at baseline over the double-blind 12-week treatment period were similar (approximately 33% to 34%) for patients who received arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily to those who received placebo. There was a dose-related increase in new, treatment-emergent arrhythmias seen in patients who received arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 25 mcg twice daily and 50 mcg once daily, 37.6% and 40.1%, respectively. The frequencies of new treatment-emergent events of non-sustained (3 to 10 beat run) and sustained (>10 beat run) ventricular tachycardia were 7.4% and 1.1% in arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily and 6.9% and 1.0% in placebo. In patients who received arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 25 mcg twice daily and 50 mcg once daily, the frequencies of non-sustained (6.2% and 8.2%, respectively) and sustained ventricular tachycardia (1.0% and 1.0%, respectively) were similar. Five cases of ventricular tachycardia were reported as adverse events (1 in arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily and 4 in placebo), with two of these events leading to discontinuation of treatment (2 in placebo). There were no baseline occurrences of atrial fibrillation/flutter observed on 24-hour Holter monitoring in patients treated with arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily or placebo. New, treatment-emergent atrial fibrillation/flutter occurred in 0.4% of patients who received arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily and 0.3% of patients who received placebo. There was a dose-related increase in the frequency of atrial fibrillation/flutter reported in the arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 25 mcg twice daily and 50 mcg once daily dose groups of 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively. Two cases of atrial fibrillation/flutter were reported as adverse events (1 in arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily and 1 in placebo). Dose-related increases in mean maximum change in heart rate in the 12 hours after dosing were also observed following 12 weeks of dosing with arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily (8.8 bpm), 25 mcg twice daily (9.9 bpm) and 50 mcg once daily (12 bpm) versus placebo (8.5 bpm). Tachyphylaxis/Tolerance Tolerance to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists can occur with regularly-scheduled, chronic use. In two placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with COPD involving approximately 725 patients in each, the overall efficacy of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution was maintained throughout the 12-week trial duration. However, tolerance to the bronchodilator effect of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution was observed after 6 weeks of dosing, as measured by a decrease in trough FEV 1 . FEV 1 improvement at the end of the 12-hour dosing interval decreased by approximately one-third (22.1% mean improvement after the first dose compared to 14.6% at week 12). Tolerance to the trough FEV 1 bronchodilator effect of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution was not accompanied by other clinical manifestations of tolerance in these trials. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics (PK) of arformoterol have been investigated in healthy subjects, elderly subjects, renally and hepatically impaired subjects, and COPD patients following the nebulization of the recommended therapeutic dose and doses up to 96 mcg. Absorption In COPD patients administered 15 mcg arformoterol every 12 hours for 14 days, the mean steady-state peak (R,R)-formoterol plasma concentration (C max ) and systemic exposure (AUC 0-12h ) were 4.3 pg/mL and 34.5 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively. The median steady-state peak (R,R)-formoterol plasma concentration time (t max ) was observed approximately one-half hour after drug administration. Systemic exposure to (R,R)-formoterol increased linearly with dose in COPD patients following arformoterol doses of 5 mcg, 15 mcg, or 25 mcg twice daily for 2 weeks or 15 mcg, 25 mcg, or 50 mcg once daily for 2 weeks. In a crossover study in patients with COPD, when arformoterol 15 mcg inhalation solution and 12 and 24 mcg formoterol fumarate inhalation powder (Foradil \u00ae Aerolizer \u00ae ) was administered twice daily for 2 weeks, the accumulation index was approximately 2.5 based on the plasma (R,R)-formoterol concentrations in all three treatments. At steady-state, geometric means of systemic exposure (AUC 0-12h ) to (R,R)-formoterol following 15 mcg of arformoterol inhalation solution and 12 mcg of formoterol fumarate inhalation powder were 39.33 pg\u2022hr/mL and 33.93 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively (ratio 1.16; 90% CI 1.00, 1.35), while the geometric means of the C max were 4.30 pg/mL and 4.75 pg/mL, respectively (ratio 0.91; 90% CI 0.76, 1.09). In a study in patients with asthma, treatment with arformoterol 50 mcg with pre- and post-treatment with activated charcoal resulted in a geometric mean decrease in (R,R)-formoterol AUC 0-6h by 27% and C max by 23% as compared to treatment with arformoterol 50 mcg alone. This suggests that a substantial portion of systemic drug exposure is due to pulmonary absorption. Distribution The binding of arformoterol to human plasma proteins in vitro was 52% to 65% at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 ng/mL of radiolabeled arformoterol. The concentrations of arformoterol used to assess the plasma protein binding were higher than those achieved in plasma following inhalation of multiple doses of 50 mcg arformoterol. Metabolism In vitro profiling studies in hepatocytes and liver microsomes have shown that arformoterol is primarily metabolized by direct conjugation (glucuronidation) and secondarily by O-demethylation. At least five human uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isozymes catalyze arformoterol glucuronidation in vitro . Two cytochrome P450 isozymes (CYP2D6 and secondarily CYP2C19) catalyze the O-demethylation of arformoterol. Arformoterol was almost entirely metabolized following oral administration of 35 mcg of radiolabeled arformoterol in eight healthy subjects. Direct conjugation of arformoterol with glucuronic acid was the major metabolic pathway. Most of the drug-related material in plasma and urine was in the form of glucuronide or sulfate conjugates of arformoterol. O-Desmethylation and conjugates of the O-desmethyl metabolite were relatively minor metabolites accounting for less than 17% of the dose recovered in urine and feces. Elimination After administration of a single oral dose of radiolabeled arformoterol to eight healthy male subjects, 63% of the total radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 11% in feces within 48 hours. A total of 89% of the total radioactive dose was recovered within 14 days, with 67% in urine and 22% in feces. Approximately 1% of the dose was recovered as unchanged arformoterol in urine over 14 days. Renal clearance was 8.9 L/hr for unchanged arformoterol in these subjects. In COPD patients given 15 mcg inhaled arformoterol twice a day for 14 days, the mean terminal half-life of arformoterol was 26 hours. Special Populations: Gender A population PK analysis indicated that there was no effect of gender upon the pharmacokinetics of arformoterol. Race The influence of race on arformoterol pharmacokinetics was assessed using a population PK analysis and data from healthy subjects. There was no clinically significant impact of race upon the pharmacokinetic profile of arformoterol. Geriatric The pharmacokinetic profile of arformoterol in 24 elderly subjects (aged 65 years or older) was compared to a younger cohort of 24 subjects (18 to 45 years) that were matched for body weight and gender. No significant differences in systemic exposure (AUC and C max ) were observed when the two groups were compared. Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of arformoterol have not been studied in pediatric subjects. Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetic profile of arformoterol was assessed in 24 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment. The systemic exposure (C max and AUC) to arformoterol increased 1.3 to 2.4-fold in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to 16 demographically matched healthy control subjects. No clear relationship between drug exposure and the severity of hepatic impairment was observed. Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment The impact of renal disease upon the pharmacokinetics of arformoterol was studied in 24 subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. Systemic exposure (AUC and C max ) to arformoterol was similar in renally impaired patients compared with demographically matched healthy control subjects. Drug-Drug Interaction When paroxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, was coadministered with arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution at steady-state, exposure to either drug was not altered. Dosage adjustments of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution are not necessary when the drug is given concomitantly with potent CYP2D6 inhibitors. Arformoterol did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9/10, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5, or CYP4A9/11 enzymes at >1,000-fold higher concentrations than the expected peak plasma concentrations following a therapeutic dose. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Arformoterol is eliminated through the action of multiple drug metabolizing enzymes. Direct glucuronidation of arformoterol is mediated by several UGT enzymes and is the primary elimination route. O-Desmethylation is a secondary route catalyzed by the CYP enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. In otherwise healthy subjects with reduced CYP2D6 and/or UGT1A1 enzyme activity, there was no impact on systemic exposure to arformoterol compared to subjects with normal CYP2D6 and/or UGT1A1 enzyme activities."], "manufacturer_name": ["Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc."], "substance_name": ["ARFORMOTEROL TARTRATE"], "effective_time": "20210531", "product_ndc": ["0093-5955"], "brand_name": ["Arformoterol tartrate"]}

Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. In vitro studies have shown that formoterol has more than 200-fold greater agonist activity at beta 2 -receptors than at beta 1 -receptors. Although beta 2 -receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta 1 -receptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta 2 -receptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective beta 2 -agonists may have cardiac effects. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. In vitro tests show that formoterol is an inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, from the human lung. Formoterol also inhibits histamine-induced plasma albumin extravasation in anesthetized guinea pigs and inhibits allergen-induced eosinophil influx in dogs with airway hyper-responsiveness. The relevance of these in vitro and animal findings to humans with COPD is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic Safety and Pharmacokinetic / Pharmacodynamic Relationships The major adverse effects of inhaled beta 2 -agonists occur as a result of excessive activation of the systemic beta-adrenergic receptors. The most common adverse effects in adults include skeletal muscle tremor and cramps, insomnia, tachycardia, decreases in plasma potassium, and increases in plasma glucose. Changes in serum potassium and serum glucose were evaluated in 12 COPD patients following inhalation of single doses of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution containing 10, 20 and 244 mcg of formoterol fumarate (calculated on an anhydrous basis) in a crossover study. At 1 hour after treatment with formoterol fumarate inhalation solution, mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) serum glucose rose 26 \u00b1 30, 29 \u00b1 28, and 38 \u00b1 44 mg/dL, respectively, and was not significantly different from baseline or trough level at 24 hours post-dose. At 1 hour after dosing with formoterol fumarate inhalation solution 244 mcg, serum potassium fell by 0.68 \u00b1 0.4 mEq/L, and was not different from baseline or trough level at 24 hours post-dose. Linear pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships between urinary formoterol excretion and decreases in serum potassium, increases in plasma glucose, and increases in heart rate were generally observed with another inhalation formulation of formoterol fumarate and hence would be expected with formoterol fumarate inhalation solution also. Following single dose administration of 10-fold the recommended clinical dose of the other formoterol fumarate inhalation formulation having comparable exposure to single dose of 244 mcg of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution (approximately 12-fold the recommended clinical dose) in healthy subjects, the formoterol plasma concentration was found to be highly correlated with the reduction in plasma potassium concentration. Data from this study showed that maximum reductions from baseline in plasma potassium ranged from 0.55 to 1.52 mmol/L with a median maximum reduction of 1.01 mmol/L. Generally, the maximum effect on plasma potassium was noted 1 to 3 hours after peak formoterol plasma concentrations were achieved. Electrophysiology In the dose-ranging study of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution, ECG-determined heart rate increased by a mean of 6 \u00b13 beats per minute at 6 hours after a single dose of 244 mcg, but was back to predose level at 16 to 24 hours. The effect of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution on heart rate and cardiac rhythm was studied in a 12-week clinical trial comparing formoterol fumarate inhalation solution to placebo and an active control treatment. COPD patients, including 105 patients exposed to formoterol fumarate inhalation solution, underwent continuous electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring during two 24-hour periods (study baseline and after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment). ECGs were performed pre-dose and at 2 to 3 hours post-dose at study baseline (prior to dosing) and after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. Bazett\u2019s and Fridericia\u2019s methods were used to correct the QT interval for heart rate (QTcB and QTcF, respectively). The mean increase from baseline in QTcB interval over the 12-week treatment period was \u2264 4.8 msec for formoterol fumarate inhalation solution and \u2264 4.6 msec for placebo. The percent of patients who experienced a maximum change in QTc greater than 60 msec at any time during the 12-week treatment period was 0% and 1.8% for formoterol fumarate inhalation solution and placebo, respectively, based on Bazett\u2019s correction, and 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively, based on Fridericia\u2019s correction. Prolonged QT was reported as an adverse event in 1 (0.8%) patient treated with formoterol fumarate inhalation solution and 2 (1.8%) placebo patients. No occurrences of atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia were observed during 24-hour Holter monitoring or reported as adverse events in patients treated with formoterol fumarate inhalation solution after the start of dosing. No increase in supraventricular tachycardia over placebo-treated subjects was observed. The mean increase in maximum heart rate from baseline to 8 to 12 weeks after the start of dosing was 0.6 beats per minute (bpm) for patients treated with formoterol fumarate inhalation solution twice daily compared to 1.2 bpm for placebo patients. There were no clinically meaningful differences from placebo in acute or chronic effects on heart rate, including QTcB and QTcF, or cardiac rhythm resulting from treatment with formoterol fumarate inhalation solution. At an exposure from formoterol fumarate dry powder formulation comparable to approximately 12-fold the recommended dose of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution, a mean maximum increase of pulse rate of 26 bpm was observed 6 hours post dose in healthy subjects. This study showed that the maximum increase of mean corrected QT interval (QTc) was 25 msec when calculated using Bazett's correction and was 8 msec when calculated using Fridericia's correction. The QTc returned to baseline within 12 to 24 hours post-dose. Formoterol plasma concentrations were weakly correlated with pulse rate and increase of QTc duration. The effects on pulse rate and QTc interval are known pharmacological effects of this class of study drug and were not unexpected at this supratherapeutic formoterol fumarate inhalation dose. Tachyphylaxis / Tolerance Tolerance to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists can occur with regularly-scheduled, chronic use. In a placebo-controlled clinical trial in 351 adult patients with COPD, the bronchodilating effect of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution was determined by the FEV 1 area under the curve over 12 hours following dosing on Day 1 and after 12 weeks of treatment. The effect of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution did not decrease after 12 weeks of twice-daily treatment (Figures 1 and 2). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Information on the pharmacokinetics of formoterol (dry powder and/or inhalation solution) in plasma and/or urine is available in healthy subjects as well as patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after oral inhalation of doses at and above the therapeutic dose. Urinary excretion of unchanged formoterol was used as an indirect measure of systemic exposure. Plasma drug disposition data parallel urinary excretion, and the elimination half-lives calculated for urine and plasma are similar. Absorption Pharmacokinetic properties of formoterol fumarate were evaluated in 12 COPD patients following inhalation of single doses of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution containing 10, 20 and 244 mcg of formoterol fumarate (calculated on an anhydrous basis) and 12 mcg formoterol fumarate dry powder, through 36 hours after single-dose administration. Formoterol fumarate concentrations in plasma following the 10 and 20 mcg doses of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution and the 12 mcg dose of formoterol fumarate dry powder were undetectable or only detected sporadically at very low concentrations. Following a single 244 mcg dose of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution (approximately 12 times the recommended clinical dose), formoterol fumarate concentrations were readily measurable in plasma, exhibiting rapid absorption into plasma, and reaching a maximum drug concentration of 72 pg/mL within approximately 12 minutes of dosing. The mean amount of formoterol excreted unchanged in 24-hour urine following single oral inhalation doses of 10, 20, and 244 mcg formoterol fumarate inhalation solution were found to be 109.7 ng, 349.6 ng, and 3317.5 ng, respectively. These findings indicate a near dose proportional increase in systemic exposure within the dose range tested. When 12 mcg of a dry powder formulation of formoterol fumarate was given twice daily to COPD patients by oral inhalation for 12 weeks, the accumulation index, based on the urinary excretion of unchanged formoterol was 1.19 to 1.38. This suggests some accumulation of formoterol in plasma with multiple dosing. Although multiple-dose pharmacokinetic data is unavailable from formoterol fumarate inhalation solution, assumption of linear pharmacokinetics allows a reasonable prediction of minimal accumulation based on single-dose pharmacokinetics. As with many drug products for oral inhalation, it is likely that the majority of the inhaled formoterol fumarate delivered is swallowed and then absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Distribution The binding of formoterol to human plasma proteins in vitro was 61% to 64% at concentrations from 0.1 to 100 ng/mL. Binding to human serum albumin in vitro was 31% to 38% over a range of 5 to 500 ng/mL. The concentrations of formoterol used to assess the plasma protein binding were higher than those achieved in plasma following inhalation of a single 244 mcg dose of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution. Metabolism Formoterol is metabolized primarily by direct glucuronidation at either the phenolic or aliphatic hydroxyl group and O-demethylation followed by glucuronide conjugation at either phenolic hydroxyl groups. Minor pathways involve sulfate conjugation of formoterol and deformylation followed by sulfate conjugation. The most prominent pathway involves direct conjugation at the phenolic hydroxyl group. The second major pathway involves O-demethylation followed by conjugation at the phenolic 2'-hydroxyl group. In vitro studies showed that multiple drug-metabolizing enzymes catalyze glucuronidation (UGT1A1, 1A8, 1A9, 2B7 and 2B15 were the most predominant enzymes) and O-demethylation (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6) of formoterol. Formoterol did not inhibit CYP450 enzymes at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Some patients may be deficient in CYP2D6 or 2C19 or both. Whether a deficiency in one or both of these isozymes results in elevated systemic exposure to formoterol or systemic adverse effects has not been adequately explored. Excretion Following administration of single 10, 20, and 244 mcg formoterol fumarate inhalation solution doses (calculated on an anhydrous basis) delivered via nebulizer in 12 COPD patients, on average, about 1.1% to 1.7% of the dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged formoterol as compared to about 3.4% excreted unchanged following inhalation administration of 12 mcg of formoterol fumarate dry powder. Renal clearance of formoterol following inhalation administration of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution in these subjects was about 157 mL/min. Based on plasma concentrations measured following the 244 mcg dose, the mean terminal elimination half-life was determined to be 7 hours. Gender As reported for another formoterol fumarate inhalation formulation, upon correction for body weight, pharmacokinetics of formoterol fumarate did not differ significantly between males and females.

Following a single 244 mcg dose of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution(approximately 12 times the recommended clinical dose), formoterol fumarate concentrations were readily measurable in plasma, exhibiting rapid absorption into plasma, and reaching a maximum drug concentration of 72 pg/mL within approximately 12 minutes of dosing. The mean amount of formoterol excreted unchanged in 24-hour urine following single oral inhalation doses of 10, 20, and 244 mcg formoterol fumarate inhalation solution were found to be 109.7 ng, 349.6 ng, and 3317.5 ng, respectively. These findings indicate a near dose proportional increase in systemic exposure within the dose range tested. When 12 mcg of a dry powder formulation of formoterol fumarate was given twice daily to COPD patients by oral inhalation for 12 weeks, the accumulation index, based on the urinary excretion of unchanged formoterol was 1.19 to 1.38. This suggests some accumulation of formoterol in plasma with multiple dosing. Although multiple-dose pharmacokinetic data is unavailable from formoterol fumarate inhalation solution, assumption of linear pharmacokinetics allows a reasonable prediction of minimal accumulation based on single-dose pharmacokinetics. As with many drug products for oral inhalation, it is likely that the majority of the inhaled formoterol fumarate delivered is swallowed and then absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Distribution The binding of formoterol to human plasma proteins in vitro was 61% to 64% at concentrations from 0.1 to 100 ng/mL. Binding to human serum albumin in vitro was 31% to 38% over a range of 5 to 500 ng/mL. The concentrations of formoterol used to assess the plasma protein binding were higher than those achieved in plasma following inhalation of a single 244 mcg dose of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution. Metabolism Formoterol is metabolized primarily by direct glucuronidation at either the phenolic or aliphatic hydroxyl group and O-demethylation followed by glucuronide conjugation at either phenolic hydroxyl groups. Minor pathways involve sulfate conjugation of formoterol and deformylation followed by sulfate conjugation. The most prominent pathway involves direct conjugation at the phenolic hydroxyl group. The second major pathway involves O-demethylation followed by conjugation at the phenolic 2'-hydroxyl group. In vitro studies showed that multiple drug-metabolizing enzymes catalyze glucuronidation (UGT1A1, 1A8, 1A9, 2B7 and 2B15 were the most predominant enzymes) and O-demethylation (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6) of formoterol. Formoterol did not inhibit CYP450 enzymes at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Some patients may be deficient in CYP2D6 or 2C19 or both. Whether a deficiency in one or both of these isozymes results in elevated systemic exposure to formoterol or systemic adverse effects has not been adequately explored. Excretion Following administration of single 10, 20, and 244 mcg formoterol fumarate inhalation solution doses (calculated on an anhydrous basis) delivered via nebulizer in 12 COPD patients, on average, about 1.1% to 1.7% of the dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged formoterol as compared to about 3.4% excreted unchanged following inhalation administration of 12 mcg of formoterol fumarate dry powder. Renal clearance of formoterol following inhalation administration of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution in these subjects was about 157 mL/min. Based on plasma concentrations measured following the 244 mcg dose, the mean terminal elimination half-life was determined to be 7 hours. Gender As reported for another formoterol fumarate inhalation formulation, upon correction for body weight, pharmacokinetics of formoterol fumarate did not differ significantly between males and females.

The molecular weight of albuterol sulfate is 576.7, and the empirical formula is (C 13 H 21 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022H 2 SO 4 . Albuterol sulfate is a white to off-white crystalline solid. It is soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol is a pressurized metered-dose aerosol unit for oral inhalation. It contains a microcrystalline suspension of albuterol sulfate in propellant HFA-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), ethanol, and oleic acid.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on beta 2 -adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that beta 2 -adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there is a population of beta 2 -receptors in the human heart existing in a concentration between 10% and 50% of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established. (See WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Effects section.) Activation of beta 2 -adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenylcyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). This increase of cyclic AMP leads to the activation of protein kinase A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in relaxation. Albuterol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles. Albuterol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway. Albuterol has been shown in most clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects. Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes. Preclinical Intravenous studies in rats with albuterol sulfate have demonstrated that albuterol crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches brain concentrations amounting to approximately 5% of the plasma concentrations. In structures outside the blood-brain barrier (pineal and pituitary glands), albuterol concentrations were found to be 100 times those in the whole brain. Studies in laboratory animals (minipigs, rodents, and dogs) have demonstrated the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death (with histologic evidence of myocardial necrosis) when beta 2 -agonist and methylxanthines were administered concurrently. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Propellant HFA-134a is devoid of pharmacological activity except at very high doses in animals (380-1300 times the maximum human exposure based on comparisons of AUC values), primarily producing ataxia, tremors, dyspnea, or salivation. These are similar to effects produced by the structurally related chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which have been used extensively in metered dose inhalers. In animals and humans, propellant HFA-134a was found to be rapidly absorbed and rapidly eliminated, with an elimination half-life of 3 to 27 minutes in animals and 5 to 7 minutes in humans. Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) and mean residence time are both extremely short, leading to a transient appearance of HFA-134a in the blood with no evidence of accumulation. Pharmacokinetics In a single-dose bioavailability study which enrolled six healthy, male volunteers, transient low albuterol levels (close to the lower limit of quantitation) were observed after administration of two puffs from both Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol and a CFC 11/12 propelled albuterol inhaler. No formal pharmacokinetic analyses were possible for either treatment, but systemic albuterol levels appeared similar. Clinical Trials In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active- and placebo-controlled trial, 565 patients with asthma were evaluated for the bronchodilator efficacy of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol (193 patients) in comparison to a CFC 11/12 propelled albuterol inhaler (186 patients) and an HFA-134a placebo inhaler (186 patients). Serial FEV 1 measurements (shown below as percent change from test-day baseline) demonstrated that two inhalations of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol produced significantly greater improvement in pulmonary function than placebo and produced outcomes which were clinically comparable to a CFC 11/12 propelled albuterol inhaler. The mean time to onset of a 15% increase in FEV 1 was 6 minutes and the mean time to peak effect was 50 to 55 minutes. The mean duration of effect as measured by a 15% increase in FEV 1 was 3 hours. In some patients, duration of effect was as long as 6 hours. In another clinical study in adults, two inhalations of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol taken 30 minutes before exercise prevented exercise-induced bronchospasm as demonstrated by the maintenance of FEV 1 within 80% of baseline values in the majority of patients. In a 4-week, randomized, open-label trial, 63 children, 4 to 11 years of age, with asthma were evaluated for the bronchodilator efficacy of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol (33 pediatric patients) in comparison to a CFC 11/12 propelled albuterol inhaler (30 pediatric patients). Serial FEV 1 measurements as percent change from test-day baseline demonstrated that two inhalations of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol produced outcomes which were clinically comparable to a CFC 11/12 propelled albuterol inhaler. The mean time to onset of a 12% increase in FEV 1 for Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol was 7 minutes and the mean time to peak effect was approximately 50 minutes. The mean duration of effect as measured by a 12% increase in FEV 1 was 2.3 hours. In some pediatric patients, duration of effect was as long as 6 hours.

It is freely soluble in methanol; slightly soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and isopropanol; and sparingly soluble in water. Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder is in a gray plastic inhaler containing a foil blister strip. Each blister on the strip contains a white powder mix of micronized fluticasone propionate (100 mcg, 250 mcg, or 500 mcg) and micronized salmeterol xinafoate salt (72.5 mcg, equivalent to 50 mcg of salmeterol base) in 12.5 mg of formulation containing lactose monohydrate (which contains milk proteins).

The actual amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors, such as inspiratory flow profile. fluticasone-propionate-chemical.jpg salmeterol-xinafoate-chemical.jpg"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Inhalation Powder Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol. The mechanisms of action described below for the individual components apply to fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. These drugs represent 2 different classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a LABA) that have different effects on clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory indices. Fluticasone Propionate Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Inflammation is also a component in the pathogenesis of COPD. In contrast to asthma, however, the predominant inflammatory cells in COPD include neutrophils, CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and macrophages. The effects of corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD are not well defined and ICS and fluticasone propionate when used apart from fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder are not indicated for the treatment of COPD. Salmeterol Xinafoate Salmeterol is a selective LABA. In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta 2 -adrenoceptors than albuterol. Although beta 2 -adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta 1 -adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta 2 -adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta 2 -agonists may have cardiac effects. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including salmeterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3\u2019,5\u2019-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. In vitro tests show that salmeterol is a potent and long-lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D 2 , from human lung. Salmeterol inhibits histamine-induced plasma protein extravasation and inhibits platelet-activating factor\u2013 induced eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of guinea pigs when administered by the inhaled route. In humans, single doses of salmeterol administered via inhalation aerosol attenuate allergen-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Inhalation Powder Healthy Subjects : Cardiovascular Effects: Since systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol are not normally seen at the therapeutic dose, higher doses were used to produce measurable effects. Four (4) trials were conducted with healthy adult subjects: (1) a single-dose crossover trial using 2 inhalations of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg and salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg given concurrently, or fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg given alone, (2) a cumulative-dose trial using 50 to 400 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder given alone or as fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, (3) a repeat-dose trial for 11 days using 2 inhalations twice daily of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg, or salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg, and (4) a single-dose trial using 5 inhalations of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg alone, or placebo. In these trials no significant differences were observed in the pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol (pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, potassium, and glucose) whether the salmeterol was given as fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, concurrently with fluticasone propionate from separate inhalers, or as salmeterol alone. The systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol were not altered by the presence of fluticasone propionate in fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. The potential effect of salmeterol on the effects of fluticasone propionate on the HPA axis was also evaluated in these trials. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: No significant differences across treatments were observed in 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion and, where measured, 24-hour plasma cortisol AUC. The systemic pharmacodynamic effects of fluticasone propionate were not altered by the presence of salmeterol in fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in healthy subjects. Subjects with Asthma: Adult and Adolescent Subjects: Cardiovascular Effects: In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older with asthma, no significant differences were observed in the systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol (pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, potassium, and glucose) whether the salmeterol was given alone or as fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. In 72 adult and adolescent subjects with asthma given either fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg or fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, continuous 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring was performed after the first dose and after 12 weeks of therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: In a 28-week trial in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg twice daily was compared with the concurrent use of salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg plus fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg from separate inhalers or fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg alone. No significant differences across treatments were observed in serum cortisol AUC after 12 weeks of dosing or in 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion after 12 and 28 weeks. In a 12-week trial in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg twice daily was compared with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg alone, salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg alone, and placebo. For most subjects, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by 30-minute cosyntropin stimulation, remained intact with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. One subject (3%) who received fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg had an abnormal response (peak serum cortisol less than 18 mcg/dL) after dosing, compared with 2 subjects (6%) who received placebo, 2 subjects (6%) who received fluticasone propionate 250 mcg, and no subjects who received salmeterol. In a repeat-dose, 3-way crossover trial, 1 inhalation twice daily of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg, FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg (fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg), or placebo was administered to 20 adult and adolescent subjects with asthma. After 28 days of treatment, geometric mean serum cortisol AUC over 12 hours showed no significant difference between fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder and FLOVENT DISKUS or between either active treatment and placebo. Pediatric Subjects: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: In a 12-week trial in subjects with asthma aged 4 to 11 years who were receiving ICS at trial entry, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg twice daily was compared with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg administered twice daily via a dry powder inhaler. The values for 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion at trial entry and after 12 weeks of treatment were similar within each treatment group. After 12 weeks, 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion was also similar between the 2 groups. Subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Cardiovascular Effects: In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in subjects with COPD, no significant differences were seen in pulse rate, blood pressure, potassium, and glucose between fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, the individual components of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, and placebo. In a trial of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, 8 subjects (2 [1.1%] in the group given fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, 1 [0.5%] in the fluticasone propionate 250-mcg group, 3 [1.7%] in the salmeterol group, and 2 [1.1%] in the placebo group) had QTc intervals greater than 470 msec at least 1 time during the treatment period. Five (5) of these 8 subjects had a prolonged QTc interval at baseline. In a 24-week trial, 130 subjects with COPD received continuous 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring prior to the first dose and after 4 weeks of twice-daily treatment with either fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg, salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg, or placebo. No significant differences in ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias and heart rate were observed among the groups treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, the individual components, or placebo. One (1) subject in the fluticasone propionate group experienced atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation, and 1 subject in the group given fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg experienced heart block. There were 3 cases of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (1 each in the placebo, salmeterol, and fluticasone propionate 500-mcg treatment groups). In 24-week clinical trials in subjects with COPD, the incidence of clinically significant ECG abnormalities (myocardial ischemia, ventricular hypertrophy, clinically significant conduction abnormalities, clinically significant arrhythmias) was lower for subjects who received salmeterol (1%, 9 of 688 subjects who received either salmeterol 50 mcg or fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder) compared with placebo (3%, 10 of 370 subjects). No significant differences with salmeterol 50 mcg alone or in combination with fluticasone propionate as fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg were observed on pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a subset of subjects with COPD who underwent 12-hour serial vital sign measurements after the first dose (n = 183) and after 12 weeks of therapy (n = 149). Median changes from baseline in pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were similar to those seen with placebo. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: Short-cosyntropin stimulation testing was performed both at Day 1 and Endpoint in 101 subjects with COPD receiving twice-daily fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg, salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg, or placebo. For most subjects, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by short cosyntropin stimulation, remained intact with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg. One (1) subject (3%) who received fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg had an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol less than 14.5 mcg/dL assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography) after dosing, compared with 2 subjects (9%) who received fluticasone propionate 250 mcg, 2 subjects (7%) who received salmeterol 50 mcg, and 1 subject (4%) who received placebo following 24 weeks of treatment or early discontinuation from trial. After 36 weeks of dosing, serum cortisol concentrations in a subset of subjects with COPD (n = 83) were 22% lower in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg and 21% lower in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate 500 mcg than in subjects receiving placebo. Other Fluticasone Propionate Products Subjects with Asthma: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using dosages up to and including 250 mcg twice daily, occasional abnormal short cosyntropin tests (peak serum cortisol less than 18 mcg/dL assessed by radioimmunoassay) were noted both in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and in subjects receiving placebo. The incidence of abnormal tests at 500 mcg twice daily was greater than placebo. In a 2-year trial carried out with a dry powder inhaler in 64 subjects with mild, persistent asthma (mean FEV 1 91% of predicted) randomized to fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily or placebo, no subject receiving fluticasone propionate had an abnormal response to 6-hour cosyntropin infusion (peak serum cortisol less than 18 mcg/dL). With a peak cortisol threshold of less than 35 mcg/dL, 1 subject receiving fluticasone propionate (4%) had an abnormal response at 1 year; repeat testing at 18 months and 2 years was normal. Another subject receiving fluticasone propionate (5%) had an abnormal response at 2 years. No subject on placebo had an abnormal response at 1 or 2 years. Subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: After 4 weeks of dosing, the steady-state fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics and serum cortisol levels were described in a subset of subjects with COPD (n = 86) randomized to twice-daily fluticasone propionate inhalation powder via a dry powder inhaler 500 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg, or placebo. Serial serum cortisol concentrations were measured across a 12-hour dosing interval. Serum cortisol concentrations following 250- and 500-mcg twice-daily dosing were 10% and 21% lower than placebo, respectively, indicating a dose-dependent increase in systemic exposure to fluticasone propionate. Other Salmeterol Xinafoate Products Subjects with Asthma: Cardiovascular Effects: Inhaled salmeterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce dose-related cardiovascular effects and effects on blood glucose and/or serum potassium [see Warnings and Precautions ( , )] . The cardiovascular effects (heart rate, blood pressure) associated with salmeterol inhalation aerosol occur with similar frequency, and are of similar type and severity, as those noted following albuterol administration. The effects of rising inhaled doses of salmeterol and standard inhaled doses of albuterol were studied in volunteers and in subjects with asthma. Salmeterol doses up to 84 mcg administered as inhalation aerosol resulted in heart rate increases of 3 to 16 beats/min, about the same as albuterol dosed at 180 mcg by inhalation aerosol (4 to 10 beats/min). Adult and adolescent subjects receiving 50-mcg doses of salmeterol inhalation powder (N = 60) underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during two 12-hour periods after the first dose and after 1 month of therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted. Concomitant Use of Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Inhalation Powder with Other Respiratory Medicines Short-acting Beta 2 -agonists: In clinical trials in subjects with asthma, the mean daily need for albuterol by 166 adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older using fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder was approximately 1.3 inhalations/day and ranged from 0 to 9 inhalations/day. Five percent (5%) of subjects using fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in these trials averaged 6 or more inhalations per day over the course of the 12-week trials. No increase in frequency of cardiovascular adverse events was observed among subjects who averaged 6 or more inhalations per day. In a clinical trial in subjects with COPD, the mean daily need for albuterol for subjects using fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg was 4.1 inhalations/day. Twenty-six percent (26%) of subjects using fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg averaged 6 or more inhalations of albuterol per day over the course of the 24-week trial. No increase in frequency of cardiovascular adverse reactions was observed among subjects who averaged 6 or more inhalations per day. Methylxanthines: The concurrent use of intravenously or orally administered methylxanthines (e.g., aminophylline, theophylline) by adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder has not been completely evaluated. In clinical trials in subjects with asthma, 39 subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, or fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg twice daily concurrently with a theophylline product had adverse event rates similar to those in 304 subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder without theophylline. Similar results were observed in subjects receiving salmeterol 50 mcg plus fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily concurrently with a theophylline product (n = 39) or without theophylline (n = 132). In a clinical trial in subjects with COPD, 17 subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg twice daily concurrently with a theophylline product had adverse event rates similar to those in 161 subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder without theophylline. Based on the available data, the concomitant administration of methylxanthines with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder did not alter the observed adverse event profile. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray: In adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in clinical trials, no difference in the profile of adverse events or HPA axis effects was noted between subjects who were receiving FLONASE (fluticasone propionate) Nasal Spray, 50 mcg concurrently (n = 46) and those who were not (n = 130). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluticasone Propionate: Healthy Subjects: Fluticasone propionate acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate is negligible (less than 1%), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. In contrast, the majority of the fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung is systemically absorbed. Following administration of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder to healthy adult subjects, peak plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate were achieved in 1 to 2 hours. In a single-dose crossover trial, a higher-than-recommended dose of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder was administered to 14 healthy adult subjects. Two (2) inhalations of the following treatments were administered: fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg and salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg given concurrently, and fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg alone. Mean peak plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate averaged 107, 94, and 120 pg/mL, respectively, indicating no significant changes in systemic exposures of fluticasone propionate. In 15 healthy subjects, systemic exposure to fluticasone propionate from 4 inhalations of ADVAIR HFA 230/21 (fluticasone propionate 230 mcg and salmeterol 21 mcg) Inhalation Aerosol (920/84 mcg) and 2 inhalations of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg (1,000 mcg/100 mcg) was similar between the 2 inhalers (i.e., 799 versus 832 pg\u2022h/mL, respectively), but approximately half the systemic exposure from 4 inhalations of fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol 220 mcg (880 mcg, AUC = 1,543 pg\u2022h/mL). Similar results were observed for peak fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations (186 and 182 pg/mL from ADVAIR HFA and fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, respectively, and 307 pg/mL from the fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol). Absolute bioavailability of fluticasone propionate was 5.3% and 5.5% following administration of ADVAIR HFA and fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, respectively. Subjects with Asthma and COPD: Peak steady-state fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations in adult subjects with asthma (N = 11) ranged from undetectable to 266 pg/mL after a 500-mcg twice-daily dose of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using a dry powder inhaler. The mean fluticasone propionate plasma concentration was 110 pg/mL. Full pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained from 9 female and 16 male subjects with asthma given fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg twice daily using a dry powder inhaler and from 14 female and 43 male subjects with COPD given 250 or 500 mcg twice daily. No overall differences in fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics were observed. Peak steady-state fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations in subjects with COPD averaged 53 pg/mL (range: 19.3 to 159.3 pg/mL) after treatment with 250 mcg twice daily (n = 30) and 84 pg/mL (range: 24.3 to 197.1 pg/mL) after treatment with 500 mcg twice daily (n = 27) via a fluticasone propionate dry powder inhaler. In another trial in subjects with COPD, peak steady-state fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations averaged 115 pg/mL (range: 52.6 to 366.0 pg/mL) after treatment with 500 mcg twice daily via a fluticasone propionate dry powder inhaler (n = 15) and 105 pg/mL (range: 22.5 to 299.0 pg/mL) via fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder (n = 24). Salmeterol Xinafoate: Healthy Subjects: Salmeterol xinafoate, an ionic salt, dissociates in solution so that the salmeterol and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (xinafoate) moieties are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated independently. Salmeterol acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Following administration of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder to healthy adult subjects, peak plasma concentrations of salmeterol were achieved in about 5 minutes. In 15 healthy subjects receiving ADVAIR HFA 230/21 Inhalation Aerosol (920/84 mcg) and fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg (1,000 mcg/100 mcg), systemic exposure to salmeterol was higher (317 versus 169 pg\u2022h/mL) and peak salmeterol concentrations were lower (196 versus 223 pg/mL) following ADVAIR HFA compared with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, although pharmacodynamic results were comparable. Subjects with Asthma: Because of the small therapeutic dose, systemic levels of salmeterol are low or undetectable after inhalation of recommended dosages (50 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder twice daily). Following chronic administration of an inhaled dose of 50 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder twice daily, salmeterol was detected in plasma within 5 to 45 minutes in 7 subjects with asthma; plasma concentrations were very low, with mean peak concentrations of 167 pg/mL at 20 minutes and no accumulation with repeated doses. Distribution Fluticasone Propionate: Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averages 99%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Salmeterol: The percentage of salmeterol bound to human plasma proteins averages 96% in vitro over the concentration range of 8 to 7,722 ng of salmeterol base per milliliter, much higher concentrations than those achieved following therapeutic doses of salmeterol. Metabolism Fluticasone Propionate: The total clearance of fluticasone propionate is high (average, 1,093 mL/min), with renal clearance accounting for less than 0.02% of the total. The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Salmeterol: Salmeterol base is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation, with subsequent elimination predominantly in the feces. No significant amount of unchanged salmeterol base was detected in either urine or feces. An in vitro study using human liver microsomes showed that salmeterol is extensively metabolized to \u03b1-hydroxysalmeterol (aliphatic oxidation) by CYP3A4. Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, essentially completely inhibited the formation of \u03b1-hydroxysalmeterol in vitro . Elimination Fluticasone Propionate: Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Terminal half-life estimates of fluticasone propionate for ADVAIR HFA, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, and fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol were similar and averaged 5.6 hours. Salmeterol: In 2 healthy adult subjects who received 1 mg of radiolabeled salmeterol (as salmeterol xinafoate) orally, approximately 25% and 60% of the radiolabeled salmeterol was eliminated in urine and feces, respectively, over a period of 7 days. The terminal elimination half-life was about 5.5 hours (1 volunteer only). The xinafoate moiety has no apparent pharmacologic activity. The xinafoate moiety is highly protein bound (greater than 99%) and has a long elimination half-life of 11 days. No terminal half-life estimates were calculated for salmeterol following administration of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. Specific Populations A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol utilizing data from 9 controlled clinical trials that included 350 subjects with asthma aged 4 to 77 years who received treatment with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, the combination of HFA-propelled fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation aerosol (ADVAIR HFA), fluticasone propionate inhalation powder (FLOVENT DISKUS), HFA-propelled fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol (FLOVENT HFA), or CFC-propelled fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. The population pharmacokinetic analyses for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol showed no clinically relevant effects of age, gender, race, body weight, body mass index, or percent of predicted FEV 1 on apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution. Age: When the population pharmacokinetic analysis for fluticasone propionate was divided into subgroups based on fluticasone propionate strength, formulation, and age (adolescents/adults and children), there were some differences in fluticasone propionate exposure. Higher fluticasone propionate exposure from fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg compared with FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg was observed in adolescents and adults (ratio 1.52 [90% CI: 1.08, 2.13]). However, in clinical trials of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration comparing fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg and FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg in adolescents and adults, no differences in systemic effects of corticosteroid treatment (e.g., HPA axis effects) were observed. Similar fluticasone propionate exposure was observed from fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg and FLOVENT DISKUS 500 mcg (ratio 0.83 [90% CI: 0.65, 1.07]) in adolescents and adults. Steady-state systemic exposure to salmeterol when delivered as fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, or ADVAIR HFA 115/21 (fluticasone propionate 115 mcg and salmeterol 21 mcg) Inhalation Aerosol was evaluated in 127 subjects aged 4 to 57 years. The geometric mean AUC was 325 pg\u2022h/mL (90% CI: 309, 341) in adolescents and adults. The population pharmacokinetic analysis included 160 subjects with asthma aged 4 to 11 years who received fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg or FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg. Higher fluticasone propionate exposure (AUC) was observed in children from fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg compared with FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg (ratio 1.20 [90% CI: 1.06, 1.37]). Higher fluticasone propionate exposure (AUC) from fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg was observed in children compared with adolescents and adults (ratio 1.63 [90% CI: 1.35, 1.96]). However, in clinical trials of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration comparing fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg and FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg in both adolescents and adults and in children, no differences in systemic effects of corticosteroid treatment (e.g., HPA axis effects) were observed. Exposure to salmeterol was higher in children compared with adolescents and adults who received fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg (ratio 1.23 [90% CI: 1.10, 1.38]). However, in clinical trials of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg in both adolescents and adults and in children, no differences in systemic effects of beta 2 -agonist treatment (e.g., cardiovascular effects, tremor) were observed. Male and Female Patients: The population pharmacokinetic analysis involved 202 males and 148 females with asthma who received fluticasone propionate alone or in combination with salmeterol and showed no gender differences for fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. The population pharmacokinetic analysis involved 76 males and 51 females with asthma who received salmeterol in combination with fluticasone propionate and showed no gender differences for salmeterol pharmacokinetics. Patients with Hepatic and Renal Impairment: Formal pharmacokinetic studies using fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder have not been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, since both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol are predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. Drug Interaction Studies In the repeat- and single-dose trials, there was no evidence of significant drug interaction in systemic exposure between fluticasone propionate and salmeterol when given alone or in combination via a dry powder inhaler. The population pharmacokinetic analysis from 9 controlled clinical trials in 350 subjects with asthma showed no significant effects on fluticasone propionate or salmeterol pharmacokinetics following co-administration with beta 2 -agonists, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or theophyllines. Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 : Ritonavir: Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (less than 10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range: 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC (0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022h/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC (0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range: 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022h/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in serum cortisol AUC. Ketoconazole: Fluticasone Propionate: In a placebo-controlled crossover trial in 8 healthy adult volunteers, coadministration of a single dose of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) with multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg) to steady state resulted in increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, a reduction in plasma cortisol AUC, and no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. Salmeterol: In a placebo-controlled, crossover drug interaction trial in 20 healthy male and female subjects, coadministration of salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure as determined by a 16-fold increase in AUC (ratio with and without ketoconazole 15.76 [90% CI: 10.66, 23.31]) mainly due to increased bioavailability of the swallowed portion of the dose. Peak plasma salmeterol concentrations were increased by 1.4-fold (90% CI: 1.23, 1.68). Three (3) out of 20 subjects (15%) were withdrawn from salmeterol and ketoconazole coadministration due to beta-agonist\u2013mediated systemic effects (2 with QTc prolongation and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole did not result in a clinically significant effect on mean heart rate, mean blood potassium, or mean blood glucose. Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration. Erythromycin: Fluticasone Propionate: In a multiple-dose drug interaction trial, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg 3 times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. Salmeterol: In a repeat-dose trial in 13 healthy subjects, concomitant administration of erythromycin (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) and salmeterol inhalation aerosol resulted in a 40% increase in salmeterol C max at steady state (ratio with and without erythromycin 1.4 [90% CI: 0.96, 2.03], P = 0.12), a 3.6-beat/min increase in heart rate ([95% CI: 0.19, 7.03], P less than 0.04), a 5.8-msec increase in QTc interval ([95% CI: -6.14, 17.77], P = 0.34), and no change in plasma potassium."], "manufacturer_name": ["Preferred Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "substance_name": ["FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE", "SALMETEROL XINAFOATE"], "effective_time": "20250514", "product_ndc": ["68788-8704"], "brand_name": ["fluticasone propionate and salmeterol"]}

(1) The bioavailability of tobramycin inhalation solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1,237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7,417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1,154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8,085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin inhalation solution administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius . (1) It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death. (3) Tobramycin has in vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . It is bactericidal in vitro at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance Treatment for 6 months with tobramycin inhalation solution in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Susceptibility Test Methods Interpretive criteria for inhaled antibacterial products are not defined. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test methods used for parenteral tobramycin therapy can be used to monitor the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. If decreased susceptibility is noted, the results should be reported to the clinician. Susceptibility breakpoints established for parenteral administration of tobramycin do not apply to aerosolized administration of tobramycin inhalation solution. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear.

It is a white to off-white crystalline substance, freely soluble in water and lower alcohols, and insoluble in lipophilic solvents such as ether, chloroform, and fluorocarbons. Figure 3. 1-2. Chemical structure of ipratropium bromide. Each 3 mL vial of ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate inhalation solution contains 3 mg (0.1%) of albuterol sulfate USP (equivalent to 2.5 mg (0.083%) of albuterol base) and 0.5 mg (0.017%) of ipratropium bromide USP in an isotonic, sterile, aqueous solution containing sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid to adjust to pH 4, edetate disodium, USP (a chelating agent) and water for injection. Ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate inhalation solution is a clear, colorless solution. It does not require dilution prior to administration by nebulization. For ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate inhalation solution, like all other nebulized treatments, the amount delivered to the lungs will depend on patient factors, the jet nebulizer utilized, and compressor performance. Using the Pari-LC-Plus\u2122 nebulizer (with face mask or mouthpiece) connected to a PRONEB\u2122 compressor system, under in vitro conditions, the mean delivered dose from the mouth piece (% nominal dose) was approximately 46% of albuterol and 42% of ipratropium bromide at a mean flow rate of 3.6 L/min. The mean nebulization time was 15 minutes or less. Ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate inhalation solution should be administered from jet nebulizers at adequate flow rates, via face masks or mouthpieces (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). structure1 structure2"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate inhalation solution is a combination of the \u03b22-adrenergic bronchodilator, albuterol sulfate, and the anticholinergic bronchodilator, ipratropium bromide. Albuterol Sulfate Mechanism of Action : The prime action of \u03b2-adrenergic drugs is to stimulate adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The cAMP thus formed mediates the cellular responses. In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on \u03b22-adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that \u03b22-adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, recent data indicated that 10% to 50% of the \u03b2-\u2011receptors in the human heart may be \u03b22-receptors. The precise function of these receptors, however, is not yet established. Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects. Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other \u03b2-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients. Pharmacokinetics: Albuterol sulfate is longer acting than isoproterenol in most patients by any route of administration, because it is not a substrate for the cellular uptake processes for catecholamine nor for the metabolism of catechol-O-methyl transferase. Instead the drug is conjugatively metabolized to albuterol 4'-O-sulfate. Animal Pharmacology/Toxicology: Intravenous studies in rats with albuterol sulfate have demonstrated that albuterol crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches brain concentrations amounting to approximately 5% of plasma concentrations. In structures outside of the blood-brain barrier (pineal and pituitary glands), albuterol concentrations were found to be 100 times those found in whole brain. Studies in laboratory animals (minipigs, rodents, and dogs) have demonstrated the occurrence of cardiac arrythmias and sudden death (with histological evidence of myocardial necrosis) when beta-agonists and methyl-xanthines are administered concurrently. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Ipratropium Bromide Mechanism of Action:. Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) agent, which blocks the muscarinic receptors of acetylcholine, and, based on animal studies, appears to inhibit vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released from the vagus nerve. Anticholinergics prevent the increases in intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), resulting from the interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptors of bronchial smooth muscle. Pharmacokinetics: The bronchodilation following inhalation of ipratropium is primarily a local, site-specific effect, not a systemic one. Much of an inhaled dose is swallowed as shown by fecal excretion studies. Following nebulization of a 1 mg dose to healthy volunteers, a mean of 4% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. Ipratropium bromide is minimally (0% to 9% in vitro) bound to plasma albumin and \u03b11\u2011-acid glycoproteins. It is partially metabolized to inactive ester hydrolysis products. Following intravenous administration, approximately one-half is excreted unchanged in the urine. The half-life of elimination is about 1.6 hours after intravenous administration. Ipratropium bromide that reaches the systemic circulation is reportedly removed by the kidneys rapidly at a rate that exceeds the glomerular filtration rate. The pharmacokinetics of ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate inhalation solution or ipratropium bromide have not been studied in the elderly and in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS). Animal Pharmacology/Toxicology:. Autoradiographic studies in rats have shown that ipratropium does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution 0.5 mg/3 mg Mechanism of Action: Ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate is expected to maximize the response to treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by reducing bronchospasm through two distinctly different mechanisms: sympathomimetic (albuterol sulfate) and anticholinergic/parasympatholytic (ipratropium bromide). Simultaneous administration of both an anticholinergic and a \u03b22-sympathomimetic is designed to produce greater bronchodilation effects than when either drug is utilized alone at its recommended dosage. Animal Pharmacology/Toxicology: In 30-day studies in Sprague-Dawley rats and Beagle dogs, subcutaneous doses of up to 205.5 mcg/kg of ipratropium administered with up to 1,000 mcg/kg albuterol in rats and 3.16 mcg/kg ipratropium and 15 mcg/kg albuterol in dogs (less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m 2 basis) did not cause death or potentiation of the cardiotoxicity induced by albuterol administered alone. Pharmacokinetics: In a double blind, double period, crossover study, 15 male and female subjects were administered single doses of ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate inhalation solution or albuterol sulfate inhalation solution at two times the recommended single doses as two inhalations separated by 15 minutes. The total nebulized dose of albuterol sulfate from both treatments was 6 mg and the total dose of ipratropium bromide from ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate inhalation solution was 1 mg. Peak albuterol plasma concentrations occurred at 0.8 hours after dosing for both treatments. The mean peak albuterol concentration following administration of albuterol sulfate alone was 4.86 (\u00b1 2.65) mg/mL and it was 4.65 (\u00b1 2.92) mg/mL for ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate. Mean AUC values for the two treatments were 26.6 (\u00b1 15.2) ng\u00b7hr/mL (albuterol sulfate alone) versus 24.2 (\u00b1 14.5) ng\u00b7hr/mL (ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate). The mean t1/2 values were 7.2 (\u00b1 1.3) hours (albuterol sulfate alone) and 6.7 (\u00b1 1.7) hours (ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate). A mean of 8.4 (\u00b1 8.9)% of the albuterol dose was excreted unchanged in urine following administration of two vials of ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate which is similar to 8.8 (\u00b1 7.3)% that was obtained from albuterol sulfate inhalation solution. There were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of albuterol between the two treatments. For ipratropium, a mean of 3.9 (\u00b1 5.1)% of the ipratropium bromide dose was excreted unchanged in urine following two vials of ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate inhalation solution, which is comparable with previously reported data. Clinical Trials: In a 12 week, randomized, double-blind, positive-control, crossover study of albuterol sulfate, ipratropium bromide, and ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate, 863 COPD patients were evaluated for bronchodilator efficacy comparing ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate with albuterol sulfate and ipratropium bromide alone. Ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate demonstrated significantly better changes in FEV1, as measured from baseline to peak response, when compared with either albuterol sulfate or ipratropium bromide. Ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate was also shown to have the rapid onset associated with albuterol sulfate, with a mean time to peak FEV1 of 1.5 hours, and the extended duration associated with ipratropium bromide with a duration of 15% response in FEV1 of 4.3 hours. Figure 3. 1-3. Mean Change in FEV 1 - Measured on Day 14 This study demonstrated that each component of ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate contributed to the improvement in pulmonary function, especially during the first 4 to 5 hours after dosing, and that ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate was significantly more effective than albuterol sulfate or ipratropium bromide alone. figure1"], "manufacturer_name": ["Proficient Rx LP"], "substance_name": ["ALBUTEROL SULFATE", "IPRATROPIUM BROMIDE"], "effective_time": "20221201", "product_ndc": ["71205-726"], "brand_name": ["Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate"]}

Mometasone furoate, the active component of ASMANEX HFA, is a corticosteroid having the chemical name 9,21-dichloro-11(Beta),17-dihydroxy-16 (alpha)-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 17-(2-furoate) with the following chemical structure: Mometasone furoate is a white powder with an empirical formula of C 27 H 30 Cl 2 O 6 , and molecular weight 521.44. It is practically insoluble in water; slightly soluble in methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol; soluble in acetone. ASMANEX HFA 50 mcg, 100 mcg, and 200 mcg are each formulated as a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA-227: 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) propelled pressurized metered dose inhaler containing sufficient amount of drug for 120 actuations [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] . After priming, each actuation of the inhaler delivers 60, 115, or 225 mcg of mometasone furoate in 69.6 mg of suspension from the valve and delivers 50, 100, or 200 mcg of mometasone furoate from the actuator. The actual amount of drug delivered to the lung may depend on patient factors, such as the coordination between actuation of the device and inspiration through the delivery system. ASMANEX HFA also contains ethanol as a cosolvent and oleic acid as a surfactant. ASMANEX HFA should be primed before using for the first time by releasing 4 test sprays into the air, away from the face, shaking well before each spray.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mometasone furoate is a corticosteroid demonstrating potent anti-inflammatory activity. The precise mechanism of corticosteroid action on asthma is not known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of inhibitory effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation and in the asthmatic response. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Mometasone furoate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor, which is approximately 12 times that of dexamethasone, 7 times that of triamcinolone acetonide, 5 times that of budesonide, and 1.5 times that of fluticasone. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids are related to systemic exposure. Pharmacokinetic data have demonstrated that, in adults, systemic exposure to mometasone furoate administered by MDI is the same or lower than that of equivalent doses of inhaled mometasone furoate administered via DPI [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Based upon the pharmacokinetic data, the systemic effects (e.g., HPA-axis suppression and growth retardation) of mometasone furoate delivered by MDI in adult and pediatric patients would be expected to be no greater than what is reported for inhaled mometasone furoate when administered at comparable doses via DPI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . HPA Axis Effects (Adults) The effects of inhaled mometasone furoate administered via ASMANEX HFA on adrenal function have not been directly evaluated. However, the effects of inhaled mometasone furoate, administered as part of a mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate inhalation aerosol combination product, on adrenal function were evaluated in two clinical trials in patients with asthma. As no evidence of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction between mometasone furoate and formoterol was observed when the two drugs were administered in combination, the HPA axis effects from the combination product are applicable to ASMANEX HFA. For the mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate combination product clinical program, HPA-axis function was assessed by 24-hour plasma cortisol AUC. Although both these trials have open-label design and contain a small number of subjects per treatment arm, results from these trials taken together demonstrated suppression of 24-hour plasma cortisol AUC for the combination mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 200 mcg/5 mcg compared to placebo consistent with the known systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroid. In a 42-day, open-label, placebo- and active-controlled study, the mean change from baseline plasma cortisol AUC (0-24 hr) was 8%, 22% and 34% lower compared to placebo for the mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 100 mcg/5 mcg (n=13), mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 200 mcg/5 mcg (n=15) and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate 230 mcg/21 mcg (n=16) treatment groups, respectively. In a 52-week, open-label safety study, the mean plasma cortisol AUC (0-24 hr) was 2.2%, 29.6%, 16.7%, and 32.2% lower from baseline for the mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 100 mcg/5 mcg (n=18), mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 200 mcg/5 mcg (n=20), fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate 125/25 mcg (n=8), and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate 250/25 mcg (n=11) treatment groups, respectively. The potential effect of mometasone furoate via a dry powder inhaler (DPI) on the HPA axis was also assessed in a 29-day study. A total of 64 adult patients with mild to moderate asthma were randomized to one of 4 treatment groups: mometasone furoate DPI 440 mcg twice daily, mometasone furoate DPI 880 mcg twice daily, oral prednisone 10 mg once daily, or placebo. The 30-minute post-Cosyntropin stimulation serum cortisol concentration on Day 29 was 23.2 mcg/dL for the mometasone furoate DPI 440 mcg twice daily group and 20.8 mcg/dL for the mometasone furoate DPI 880 mcg twice daily group, compared to 14.5 mcg/dL for the oral prednisone 10 mg group and 25 mcg/dL for the placebo group. The difference between mometasone furoate DPI 880 mcg twice daily (twice the maximum recommended dose) and placebo was statistically significant. HPA Axis Effects (Pediatrics) The potential effect of mometasone furoate via a DPI on the HPA axis was assessed in 50 children aged 6 to 11 years in a 29-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. In this study, the mean difference from placebo in plasma cortisol AUC (0-12hr) for DPI 110 mcg twice daily was 3.4 mcg\u2219hr/dL (95% CI: -14.0, 20.7) and for 220 mcg twice daily was -16.0 mcg\u2219hr/dL (95% CI: -33.9, 1.9). The mean difference from placebo in plasma cortisol AUC (0-12hr) for the 440 mcg twice daily group (eight times the currently recommended mometasone furoate dose via a DPI in children ages 4-11) was -17.9 mcg\u2219hr/dL (95% CI: -35.8, 0.0). The mean differences in urinary-free cortisol changes from baseline compared to placebo were 3.1 mcg/day (95% CI: -3.3, 9.6), 3.3 mcg/day (95% CI: -3.0, 9.7), and -2.0 mcg/day (95% CI: -8.6, 4.6) for the groups treated with 110 mcg twice daily, 220 mcg twice daily, and 440 mcg twice daily, respectively. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics As no evidence of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction between mometasone furoate and formoterol was observed when the two drugs were administered from a mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate combination product, the pharmacokinetics information from the combination product is applicable to ASMANEX HFA. Absorption Adult Healthy Subjects: Following oral inhalation of single doses of ASMANEX HFA, mometasone furoate was absorbed in healthy subjects with median T max values ranging from 0.50 to 2 hours. Following single-dose administration of higher than recommended dose of ASMANEX HFA (4 inhalations of ASMANEX HFA 200 mcg) in healthy subjects, the arithmetic mean (CV%) C max and AUC (0-tf) values for mometasone furoate were 53 (102) pg/mL and 992 (80) pg\u2219hr/mL, respectively. Studies using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of mometasone furoate is negligible (<1%). Following single-dose administration of a higher than recommended dose of mometasone furoate (4 inhalations of mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 200 mcg/5 mcg) in healthy subjects, the arithmetic mean (CV%) C max and AUC (0-12 hr) values for mometasone furoate were 67.8 (49) pg/mL and 650 (51) pg\u2219hr/mL, respectively, while the corresponding estimates following 5 days of BID dosing with mometasone furoate 800 mcg/20 mcg were 241 (36) pg/mL and 2200 (35) pg\u2219hr/mL. The systemic exposure to mometasone furoate (based on AUC) was approximately 52% and 25% lower on Day 1 and Day 5, respectively, following mometasone furoate administration compared to mometasone furoate via a DPI. Adult Asthma Patients: Following oral inhalation of single and multiple doses of the mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate combination product, mometasone furoate was absorbed in asthma patients with median T max values ranging from 1 to 2 hours. Following single-dose administration of mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 400 mcg/10 mcg, the arithmetic mean (CV%) C max and AUC (0-12 hr) values for mometasone furoate were 20 (88) pg/mL and 170 (94) pg\u2219hr/mL, respectively, while the corresponding estimates following twice daily dosing of mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 400 mcg/10 mcg at steady-state were 60 (36) pg/mL and 577 (40) pg\u2219hr/mL. Distribution Based on the study employing a 1000 mcg inhaled dose of tritiated mometasone furoate inhalation powder in humans, no appreciable accumulation of mometasone furoate in the red blood cells was found. Following an intravenous 400 mcg dose of mometasone furoate, the plasma concentrations showed a biphasic decline, with a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 152 liters. The in vitro protein binding for mometasone furoate was reported to be 98% to 99% (in a concentration range of 5 to 500 ng/mL). Metabolism Studies have shown that mometasone furoate is primarily and extensively metabolized in the liver of all species investigated and undergoes extensive metabolism to multiple metabolites. In vitro studies have confirmed the primary role of human liver CYP3A4 in the metabolism of this compound; however, no major metabolites were identified. Human liver CYP3A4 metabolizes mometasone furoate to 6-beta hydroxy mometasone furoate. Excretion Following an intravenous dosing, the terminal half-life was reported to be about 5 hours. Following the inhaled dose of tritiated 1000 mcg mometasone furoate, the radioactivity is excreted mainly in the feces (a mean of 74%), and to a small extent in the urine (a mean of 8%) up to 7 days. No radioactivity was associated with unchanged mometasone furoate in the urine. Absorbed mometasone furoate is cleared from plasma at a rate of approximately 12.5 mL/min/kg, independent of dose. The effective t \u00bd for mometasone furoate following inhalation was 25 hours in adult healthy subjects and in adult patients with asthma. Special Populations Hepatic/Renal Impairment: There are no data regarding the specific use of ASMANEX HFA in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. A study evaluating the administration of a single inhaled dose of 400 mcg mometasone furoate by a dry powder inhaler to adult subjects with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment resulted in only 1 or 2 subjects in each group having detectable peak plasma concentrations of mometasone furoate (ranging from 50-105 pg/mL). The observed peak plasma concentrations appear to increase with severity of hepatic impairment; however, the numbers of detectable levels were few. Gender and Race: Specific studies to examine the effects of gender and race on the pharmacokinetics of ASMANEX HFA have not been specifically studied. Geriatrics: The pharmacokinetics of ASMANEX HFA have not been specifically studied in the elderly population. Drug-Drug Interactions A single-dose crossover study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of 4 inhalations of the following: mometasone furoate MDI, formoterol MDI, mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate MDI combination product, and mometasone furoate MDI plus formoterol fumarate MDI administered concurrently. The results of the study indicated that there was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between mometasone furoate and formoterol. Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes: Ketoconazole: In a drug interaction study, an inhaled dose of mometasone furoate 400 mcg delivered by a dry powder inhaler was given to 24 adult healthy subjects twice daily for 9 days and ketoconazole 200 mg (as well as placebo) were given twice daily concomitantly on Days 4 to 9. Mometasone furoate plasma concentrations were <150 pg/mL on Day 3 prior to coadministration of ketoconazole or placebo. Following concomitant administration of ketoconazole, 4 out of 12 subjects in the ketoconazole treatment group (n=12) had peak plasma concentrations of mometasone furoate >200 pg/mL on Day 9 (211-324 pg/mL). Mometasone furoate plasma levels appeared to increase and plasma cortisol levels appeared to decrease upon concomitant administration of ketoconazole."], "manufacturer_name": ["Organon LLC"], "substance_name": ["MOMETASONE FUROATE"], "effective_time": "20241120", "product_ndc": ["78206-111", "78206-112", "78206-113"], "brand_name": ["ASMANEX HFA"]}

These drugs represent two classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a long-acting selective beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist) that have different effects on clinical, physiological, and inflammatory indices of COPD and asthma. Budesonide Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. In standard in vitro and animal models, budesonide has approximately a 200-fold higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency than cortisol (rat croton oil ear edema assay). As a measure of systemic activity, budesonide is 40 times more potent than cortisol when administered subcutaneously and 25 times more potent when administered orally in the rat thymus involution assay. In glucocorticoid receptor affinity studies, the 22R form of budesonide was two times as active as the 22S epimer. In vitro studies indicated that the two forms of budesonide do not interconvert. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of COPD and asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non\u2013allergic-mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in COPD and asthma. Studies in asthmatic patients have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects over a wide range of doses of budesonide. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, extensive first pass hepatic degradation of orally absorbed drug (85%-95%), and the low potency of formed metabolites. Formoterol Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (beta 2 -agonist) with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. In vitro studies have shown that formoterol has more than 200-fold greater agonist activity at beta 2 -receptors than at beta 1 -receptors. The in vitro binding selectivity to beta 2 - over beta 1 -adrenoceptors is higher for formoterol than for albuterol (5 times), whereas salmeterol has a higher (3 times) beta 2 -selectivity ratio than formoterol. Although beta 2 -receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta 1 -receptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta 2 -receptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective beta 2 -agonists may have cardiac effects. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. In vitro tests show that formoterol is an inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, from the human lung. Formoterol also inhibits histamine-induced plasma albumin extravasation in anesthetized guinea pigs and inhibits allergen-induced eosinophil influx in dogs with airway hyper-responsiveness. The relevance of these in vitro and animal findings to humans is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Asthma Cardiovascular effects: In a single-dose cross-over study involving 201 patients with persistent asthma, single-dose treatments of 4.5, 9, and 18 mcg of formoterol in combination with 320 mcg of budesonide delivered via BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL were compared to budesonide 320 mcg alone. Dose-ordered improvements in FEV 1 were demonstrated when compared with budesonide. ECGs and blood samples for glucose and potassium were obtained post-dose. For budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, small mean increases in serum glucose and decreases in serum potassium (+0.44 mmol/L and -0.18 mmol/L at the highest dose, respectively) were observed with increasing doses of formoterol, compared to budesonide. In ECGs, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate produced small dose-related mean increases in heart rate (approximately 3 bpm at the highest dose), and QTc intervals (3-6 msec) compared to budesonide alone. No subject had a QT or QTc value \u2265500 msec. In the United States, five 12-week, active- and placebo-controlled studies and one 6-month active-controlled study evaluated 2976 patients aged 6 years and older with asthma. Systemic pharmacodynamic effects of formoterol (heart/pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, potassium, and glucose) were similar in patients treated with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, compared with patients treated with formoterol dry inhalation powder 4.5 mcg, 2 inhalations twice daily. No patient had a QT or QTc value \u2265500 msec during treatment. In three placebo-controlled studies in adolescents and adults with asthma, aged 12 years and older, a total of 1232 patients (553 patients in the budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate group) had evaluable continuous 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring. Overall, there were no important differences in the occurrence of ventricular or supraventricular ectopy and no evidence of increased risk for clinically significant dysrhythmia in the budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate group compared to placebo. HPA-axis effects: Overall, no clinically important effects on HPA-axis, as measured by 24-hour urinary cortisol, were observed for budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate treated adult or adolescent patients at doses up to 640/18 mcg/day compared to budesonide. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Cardiovascular effects: In two COPD lung function studies, 6 months and 12 months in duration including 3668 COPD patients, no clinically important differences were seen in pulse rate, blood pressure, potassium, and glucose between budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, the individual components of BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL, and placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . ECGs recorded at multiple clinic visits on treatment in both studies showed no clinically important differences for heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, heart rate, signs of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias between budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5 the monoproducts and placebo, all administered as 2 inhalations twice daily. Based on ECGs, 6 patients treated with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5, 6 patients treated with formoterol 4.5 mcg, and 6 patients in the placebo group experienced atrial fibrillation or flutter that was not present at baseline. There were no cases of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in the budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5, formoterol 4.5 mcg, or placebo groups. In the 12-month study, 520 patients had evaluable continuous 24-hour ECG (Holter) monitoring prior to the first dose and after approximately 1 and 4 months on treatment. No clinically important differences in ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias, ventricular or supraventricular ectopic beats, or heart rate were observed among the groups treated with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5, formoterol or placebo taken as 2 inhalations twice daily. Based on ECG (Holter) monitoring, one patient on budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5, no patients on formoterol 4.5 mcg, and three patients in the placebo group experienced atrial fibrillation or flutter that was not present at baseline. HPA-axis effects: Twenty-four hour urinary cortisol measurements were collected in a pooled subset (n=616) of patients from two COPD lung function studies. The data indicated approximately 30% lower mean 24-hour urinary free cortisol values following chronic administration (> 6 months) of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, relative to placebo. Budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate appeared to exhibit comparable cortisol suppression to budesonide 160 mcg alone or coadministration of budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg. For patients treated with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, or placebo for up to 12 months, the percentage of patients who shifted from normal to low for this measure were generally comparable. Other Budesonide Products To confirm that systemic absorption is not a significant factor in the clinical efficacy of inhaled budesonide, a clinical study in patients with asthma was performed comparing 400 mcg budesonide administered via a pressurized metered dose inhaler with a tube spacer to 1400 mcg of oral budesonide and placebo. The study demonstrated the efficacy of inhaled budesonide but not orally ingested budesonide, despite comparable systemic levels. Thus, the therapeutic effect of conventional doses of orally inhaled budesonide are largely explained by its direct action on the respiratory tract. Inhaled budesonide has been shown to decrease airway reactivity to various challenge models, including histamine, methacholine, sodium metabisulfite, and adenosine monophosphate in patients with hyperreactive airways. The clinical relevance of these models is not certain. Pretreatment with inhaled budesonide, 1600 mcg daily (800 mcg twice daily) for 2 weeks reduced the acute (early-phase reaction) and delayed (late-phase reaction) decrease in FEV 1 following inhaled allergen challenge. The systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids are related to the systemic exposure to such drugs. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that in both adults and children with asthma the systemic exposure to budesonide is lower with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, compared with inhaled budesonide administered at the same delivered dose via a dry powder inhaler [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the systemic effects (HPA-axis and growth) of budesonide delivered from budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, would be expected to be no greater than what is reported for inhaled budesonide when administered at comparable doses via the dry powder inhaler [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . HPA-axis effects: The effects of inhaled budesonide administered via a dry powder inhaler on the HPA-axis were studied in 905 adults and 404 pediatric patients with asthma. For most patients, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test, remained intact with budesonide treatment at recommended doses. For adult patients treated with 100, 200, 400, or 800 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks, 4%, 2%, 6%, and 13%, respectively, had an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol <14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography following short-cosyntropin test) as compared to 8% of patients treated with placebo. Similar results were obtained in pediatric patients. In another study in adults, doses of 400, 800, and 1600 mcg of inhaled budesonide twice daily for 6 weeks were examined; 1600 mcg twice daily (twice the maximum recommended dose) resulted in a 27% reduction in stimulated cortisol (6-hour ACTH infusion) while 10-mg prednisone resulted in a 35% reduction. In this study, no patient on budesonide at doses of 400 and 800 mcg twice daily met the criterion for an abnormal stimulated-cortisol response (peak cortisol <14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography) following ACTH infusion. An open-label, long-term follow-up of 1133 patients for up to 52 weeks confirmed the minimal effect on the HPA-axis (both basal- and stimulated-plasma cortisol) of budesonide when administered at recommended doses. In patients who had previously been oral-steroid-dependent, use of budesonide in recommended doses was associated with higher stimulated-cortisol response compared to baseline following 1 year of therapy. Other Formoterol Products While the pharmacodynamic effect is via stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, excessive activation of these receptors commonly leads to skeletal muscle tremor and cramps, insomnia, tachycardia, decreases in plasma potassium, and increases in plasma glucose. Inhaled formoterol, like other beta 2 -adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce dose-related cardiovascular effects and effects on blood glucose and/or serum potassium [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . For budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, these effects are detailed in the Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacodynamics, BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL (12.2) section. Use of LABA drugs can result in tolerance to bronchoprotective and bronchodilatory effects. Rebound bronchial hyperresponsiveness after cessation of chronic long-acting beta-agonist therapy has not been observed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL Absorption Budesonide Healthy Subjects: Orally inhaled budesonide is rapidly absorbed in the lungs and peak concentration is typically reached within 20 minutes. After oral administration of budesonide peak plasma concentration was achieved in about 1 to 2 hours and the absolute systemic availability was 6%-13% due to extensive first pass metabolism. In contrast, most of the budesonide delivered to the lungs was systemically absorbed. In healthy subjects, 34% of the metered dose was deposited in the lung (as assessed by plasma concentration method and using a budesonide-containing dry powder inhaler) with an absolute systemic availability of 39% of the metered dose. Following administration of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5, two or four inhalations twice daily for 5 days in healthy subjects, plasma concentration of budesonide generally increased in proportion to dose. The accumulation index for the group that received 2 inhalations twice daily was 1.32 for budesonide. Asthma Patients: In a single-dose study, higher than recommended doses of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (12 inhalations of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5) were administered to patients with moderate asthma. Peak budesonide plasma concentration of 4.5 nmol/L occurred at 20 minutes following dosing. This study demonstrated that the total systemic exposure to budesonide from budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate was approximately 30% lower than from inhaled budesonide via a dry powder inhaler (DPI) at the same delivered dose. Following administration of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, the half-life of the budesonide component was 4.7 hours. In a repeat dose study, the highest recommended dose of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (160/4.5, two inhalations twice daily) was administered to patients with moderate asthma and healthy subjects for 1 week. Peak budesonide plasma concentration of 1.2 nmol/L occurred at 21 minutes in asthma patients. Peak budesonide plasma concentration was 27% lower in asthma patients compared to that in healthy subjects. However, the total systemic exposure of budesonide was comparable to that in asthma patients. Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide administered by DPI in adults with asthma averaged 0.6 and 1.6 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively. In asthmatic patients, budesonide showed a linear increase in AUC and C max with increasing dose after both single and repeated dosing of inhaled budesonide. COPD Patients: In a single-dose study, 12 inhalations of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 80/4.5 (total dose 960/54 mcg) were administered to patients with COPD. Mean budesonide peak plasma concentration of 3.3 nmol/L occurred at 30 minutes following dosing. Budesonide systemic exposure was comparable between budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate pMDI and coadministration of budesonide via a metered-dose inhaler and formoterol via a dry powder inhaler (budesonide 960 mcg and formoterol 54 mcg). In the same study, an open-label group of moderate asthma patients also received the same higher dose of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. For budesonide, COPD patients exhibited 12% greater AUC and 10% lower C max compared to asthma patients. In the 6-month pivotal lung function clinical study, steady-state pharmacokinetic data of budesonide was obtained in a subset of COPD patients with treatment arms of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate pMDI 160/4.5, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate pMDI 80/4.5, budesonide 160 mcg, budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg given together, all administered as 2 inhalations twice daily. Budesonide systemic exposure (AUC and C max ) increased proportionally with doses from 80 mcg to 160 mcg and was generally similar between the 3 treatment groups receiving the same dose of budesonide (budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate pMDI 160/4.5, budesonide 160 mcg, budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg administered together). Formoterol Inhaled formoterol is rapidly absorbed; peak plasma concentrations are typically reached at the first plasma sampling time, within 5-10 minutes after dosing. As with many drug products for oral inhalation, it is likely that the majority of the inhaled formoterol delivered is swallowed and then absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Healthy Subjects: Following administration of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (160/4.5, two or four inhalations twice daily) for 5 days in healthy subjects, plasma concentration of formoterol generally increased in proportion to dose. The accumulation index for the group that received 2 inhalations twice daily was 1.77 for formoterol. Asthma patients: In a single-dose study, higher than recommended doses of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (12 inhalations of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5) were administered to patients with moderate asthma. Peak plasma concentration for formoterol of 136 pmol occurred at 10 minutes following dosing. Approximately 8% of the delivered dose of formoterol was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug. In a repeat dose study, the highest recommended dose of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (160/4.5, two inhalations twice daily) was administered to patients with moderate asthma and healthy subjects for 1 week. Peak formoterol plasma concentration of 28 pmol/L occurred at 10 minutes in asthma patients. Peak formoterol plasma concentration was about 42% lower in asthma patients compared to that in healthy subjects. However, the total systemic exposure of formoterol was comparable to that in asthma patients. COPD patients: Following single-dose administration of 12 inhalations of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 80/4.5, mean peak formoterol plasma concentration of 167 pmol/L was rapidly achieved at 15 minutes after dosing. Formoterol exposure was slightly greater (~16-18%) from budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate pMDI compared to coadministration of budesonide via a metered-dose inhaler and formoterol via a dry powder inhaler (total dose of budesonide 960 mcg and formoterol 54 mcg). In the same study, an open label group of moderate asthma patients received the same dose of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. COPD patients exhibited 12-15% greater AUC and C max for formoterol compared to asthma patients. In the 6-month pivotal lung function clinical study, steady-state pharmacokinetic data of formoterol was obtained in a subset of COPD patients with treatment arms of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate pMDI 160/4.5, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate pMDI 80/4.5, formoterol 4.5 mcg, budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg given together, all administered as 2 inhalations twice daily. The systemic exposure of formoterol as evidenced by AUC, was about 30% and 16% higher from budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate pMDI compared to formoterol alone treatment arm and coadministration of individual components of budesonide and formoterol treatment arm, respectively. Distribution Budesonide: The volume of distribution of budesonide was approximately 3 L/kg. It was 85%-90% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding was constant over the concentration range (1-100 nmol/L) achieved with, and exceeding, recommended inhaled doses. Budesonide showed little or no binding to corticosteroid binding globulin. Budesonide rapidly equilibrated with red blood cells in a concentration independent manner with a blood plasma ratio of about 0.8. Formoterol: Over the concentration range of 10-500 nmol/L, plasma protein binding for the RR and SS enantiomers of formoterol was 46% and 58%, respectively. The concentrations of formoterol used to assess the plasma protein binding were higher than those achieved in plasma following inhalation of a single 54 mcg dose. Metabolism Budesonide: In vitro studies with human liver homogenates have shown that budesonide was rapidly and extensively metabolized. Two major metabolites formed via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) catalyzed biotransformation have been isolated and identified as 16\u03b1-hydroxyprednisolone and 6\u00df-hydroxybudesonide. The corticosteroid activity of each of these two metabolites was less than 1% of that of the parent compound. No qualitative differences between the in vitro and in vivo metabolic patterns were detected. Negligible metabolic inactivation was observed in human lung and serum preparations. Formoterol: The primary metabolism of formoterol is by direct glucuronidation and by O-demethylation followed by conjugation to inactive metabolites. Secondary metabolic pathways include deformylation and sulfate conjugation. CYP2D6 and CYP2C have been identified as being primarily responsible for O-demethylation. Elimination Budesonide: Budesonide was excreted in urine and feces in the form of metabolites. Approximately 60% of an intravenous radiolabeled dose was recovered in the urine. No unchanged budesonide was detected in the urine. The 22R form of budesonide was preferentially cleared by the liver with systemic clearance of 1.4 L/min vs. 1.0 L/min for the 22S form. The terminal half-life, 2 to 3 hours, was the same for both epimers and was independent of dose. Formoterol: The excretion of formoterol was studied in four healthy subjects following simultaneous administration of radiolabeled formoterol via the oral and IV routes. In that study, 62% of the radiolabeled formoterol was excreted in the urine while 24% was eliminated in the feces. Special Populations Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate in geriatric patients have not been specifically studied. Pediatric Plasma concentrations of budesonide were measured following administration of four inhalations of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5 in a single-dose study in pediatric patients with asthma, 6 to less than 12 years of age. Peak budesonide concentrations of 1.4 nmol/L occurred at 20 minutes post-dose. This study also demonstrated that the total systemic exposure to budesonide from budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate was approximately 30% lower than from inhaled budesonide via a dry powder inhaler that was also evaluated at the same delivered dose. The dose-normalized C max and AUC 0-inf of budesonide following single dose inhalation in children 6 to less than 12 years of age were numerically lower than that observed in adults. Following 2 inhalations of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5 twice daily treatment, formoterol C max and AUC 0-6 at steady state in children 6 to less than 12 years of age were comparable to that observed in adults. Gender/Race Specific studies to examine the effects of gender and race on the pharmacokinetics of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate have not been conducted. Population PK analysis of the budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate data indicates that gender does not affect the pharmacokinetics of budesonide and formoterol. No conclusions can be drawn on the effect of race due to the low number of non-Caucasians evaluated for PK. Nursing Mothers The disposition of budesonide when delivered by inhalation from a dry powder inhaler at doses of 200 or 400 mcg twice daily for at least 3 months was studied in eight lactating women with asthma from 1 to 6 months postpartum. Systemic exposure to budesonide in these women appears to be comparable to that in non-lactating women with asthma from other studies. Breast milk obtained over eight hours post-dose revealed that the maximum concentration of budesonide for the 400 and 800 mcg total daily doses was 0.39 and 0.78 nmol/L, respectively, and occurred within 45 minutes after dosing. The estimated oral daily dose of budesonide from breast milk to the infant is approximately 0.007 and 0.014 mcg/kg/day for the two dose regimens used in this study, which represents approximately 0.3% to 1% of the dose inhaled by the mother. Budesonide levels in plasma samples obtained from five infants at about 90 minutes after breastfeeding (and about 140 minutes after drug administration to the mother) were below quantifiable levels (<0.02 nmol/L in four infants and <0.04 nmol/L in one infant) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] . Renal or Hepatic Insufficiency There are no data regarding the specific use of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Reduced liver function may affect the elimination of corticosteroids. Budesonide pharmacokinetics was affected by compromised liver function as evidenced by a doubled systemic availability after oral ingestion. The intravenous budesonide pharmacokinetics was, however, similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Specific data with formoterol is not available, but because formoterol is primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism, an increased exposure can be expected in patients with severe liver impairment. Drug-Drug Interactions A single-dose crossover study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of eight inhalations of the following: budesonide, formoterol, and budesonide plus formoterol administered concurrently. The results of the study indicated that there was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between the two components of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Ketoconazole : Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), the main metabolic enzyme for corticosteroids, increased plasma levels of orally ingested budesonide. Cimetidine : At recommended doses, cimetidine, a non-specific inhibitor of CYP enzymes, had a slight but clinically insignificant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral budesonide.

Albuterol sulfate has the chemical name \u03b1 1 -[( tert -butylamino) methyl]-4-hydroxy- m -xylene-\u03b1,\u03b1'-diol sulfate (2:1) (salt), and has the following chemical structure: The molecular weight of albuterol sulfate is 576.7, and the empirical formula is (C 13 H 21 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022 H 2 SO 4 . Albuterol sulfate is a white or almost white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water and very slightly soluble in ethanol. Albuterol sulfate is the official generic name in the United States, and salbutamol sulfate is the World Health Organization recommended generic name. Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol is a pressurized metered-dose aerosol unit with a dose indicator. Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol is for oral inhalation only.

Prime the inhaler before using for the first time and in cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 2 weeks by releasing three sprays into the air, away from the face. After priming, each actuation delivers 108 mcg albuterol sulfate, from the actuator mouthpiece (equivalent to 90 mcg of albuterol base). Each canister provides 200 actuations (inhalations). This product does not contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as the propellant. Albuterol sulfate"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Albuterol sulfate is a beta 2 -adrenergic agonist. The pharmacologic effects of albuterol sulfate are attributable to activation of beta 2 -adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle. Activation of beta 2 -adrenergic receptors leads to the activation of adenylcyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). This increase of cyclic AMP is associated with the activation of protein kinase A, which in turn inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in muscle relaxation. Albuterol relaxes the smooth muscle of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles. Albuterol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway. While it is recognized that beta 2 -adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there are beta-receptors in the human heart, 10% to 50% of which are cardiac beta 2 -adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4 )] . Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects. However, inhaled albuterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4 )] . 12.2 Pharmacokinetics The systemic levels of albuterol are low after inhalation of recommended doses. In a crossover study conducted in healthy male and female volunteers, high cumulative doses of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol (1,080 mcg of albuterol base administered over one hour) yielded mean peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and systemic exposure (AUC inf ) of approximately 4,100 pg/mL and 28,426 pg/mL*hr, respectively compared to approximately 3,900 pg/mL and 28,395 pg/mL*hr, respectively following the same dose of an active HFA-134a albuterol inhaler comparator. The terminal plasma half-life of albuterol delivered by albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol was approximately 6 hours. Comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters demonstrated no differences between the products. The pharmacokinetic profile of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol was evaluated in a two-way cross-over study in 11 healthy pediatric volunteers, 4 to 11 years of age. A single dose administration of albuterol sulfate (180 mcg albuterol base) yielded a least square mean (SE) C max and AUC 0 to \u221e of 1,100 (1.18) pg/mL and 5,120 (1.15) pg/mL*hr, respectively. The least square mean (SE) terminal plasma half-life of albuterol delivered by albuterol sulfate was 166 (7.8) minutes. Metabolism and Elimination Information available in the published literature suggests that the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of albuterol in humans is SULTIA3 (sulfotransferase). When racemic albuterol was administered either intravenously or via inhalation after oral charcoal administration, there was a 3- to 4-fold difference in the area under the concentration-time curves between the (R)- and (S)-albuterol enantiomers, with (S)-albuterol concentrations being consistently higher. However, without charcoal pretreatment, after either oral or inhalation administration the differences were 8- to 24-fold, suggesting that the (R)- albuterol is preferentially metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract, presumably by SULTIA3. The primary route of elimination of albuterol is through renal excretion (80% to 100%) of either the parent compound or the primary metabolite. Less than 20% of the drug is detected in the feces. Following intravenous administration of racemic albuterol, between 25% and 46% of the (R)-albuterol fraction of the dose was excreted as unchanged (R)-albuterol in the urine. Geriatric, Pediatric, Hepatic/Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies for albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol have been conducted in neonates or elderly subjects. The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol has not been evaluated. The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of albuterol was evaluated in 5 subjects with creatinine clearance of 7 to 53 mL/min, and the results were compared with those from healthy volunteers. Renal disease had no effect on the half-life, but there was a 67% decline in albuterol clearance. Caution should be used when administering high doses of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol to patients with renal impairment [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.5 )] ."], "manufacturer_name": ["REMEDYREPACK INC."], "substance_name": ["ALBUTEROL SULFATE"], "effective_time": "20241119", "product_ndc": ["70518-3541"], "brand_name": ["Albuterol sulfate"]}

Salmeterol xinafoate is the racemic form of the 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid salt of salmeterol. It has the chemical name 1,3-benzenedimethanol, 4-hydroxy-\u03b1 1 -[[[6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexyl]amino]methyl]-(\u00b1)-,1-hydroxy-2-naphthalenecarboxylate (salt) and the following chemical structure: Salmeterol xinafoate is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 603.75, and the empirical formula is C 25 H 37 NO 4 \u2022C 11 H 8 O 3 . It is freely soluble in methanol; slightly soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and isopropanol; and sparingly soluble in water. Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder is in a gray plastic inhaler containing a foil blister strip. Each blister on the strip contains a white powder mix of micronized fluticasone propionate (100 mcg or 250 mcg) and micronized salmeterol xinafoate salt (72.5 mcg, equivalent to 50 mcg of salmeterol base) in 12.5 mg of formulation containing lactose monohydrate (which contains milk proteins). After the inhaler is activated, the powder is dispersed into the airstream created by the patient inhaling through the mouthpiece. Under standardized in vitro test conditions, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder delivers 93 mcg and 233 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 45 mcg of salmeterol base per blister from fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg and fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, respectively, when tested at a flow rate of 60 L/min for 2 seconds.

The mechanisms of action described below for the individual components apply to fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. These drugs represent 2 different classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a LABA) that have different effects on clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory indices. Fluticasone Propionate Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Inflammation is also a component in the pathogenesis of COPD. In contrast to asthma, however, the predominant inflammatory cells in COPD include neutrophils, CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and macrophages. The effects of corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD are not well defined and ICS and fluticasone propionate when used apart from fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder are not indicated for the treatment of COPD. Salmeterol Xinafoate Salmeterol is a selective LABA. In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta 2 -adrenoceptors than albuterol. Although beta 2 -adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta 1 -adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta 2 -adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta 2 -agonists may have cardiac effects. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including salmeterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3\u2019,5\u2019-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. In vitro tests show that salmeterol is a potent and long-lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D 2 , from human lung. Salmeterol inhibits histamine-induced plasma protein extravasation and inhibits platelet-activating factor\u2013 induced eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of guinea pigs when administered by the inhaled route. In humans, single doses of salmeterol administered via inhalation aerosol attenuate allergen-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Inhalation Powder Healthy Subjects : Cardiovascular Effects: Since systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol are not normally seen at the therapeutic dose, higher doses were used to produce measurable effects. Four (4) trials were conducted with healthy adult subjects: (1) a single-dose crossover trial using 2 inhalations of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg and salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg given concurrently, or fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg given alone, (2) a cumulative-dose trial using 50 to 400 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder given alone or as fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, (3) a repeat-dose trial for 11 days using 2 inhalations twice daily of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg, or salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg, and (4) a single-dose trial using 5 inhalations of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg alone, or placebo. In these trials no significant differences were observed in the pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol (pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, potassium, and glucose) whether the salmeterol was given as fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, concurrently with fluticasone propionate from separate inhalers, or as salmeterol alone. The systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol were not altered by the presence of fluticasone propionate in fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. The potential effect of salmeterol on the effects of fluticasone propionate on the HPA axis was also evaluated in these trials. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: No significant differences across treatments were observed in 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion and, where measured, 24-hour plasma cortisol AUC. The systemic pharmacodynamic effects of fluticasone propionate were not altered by the presence of salmeterol in fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in healthy subjects. Subjects with Asthma: Adult and Adolescent Subjects: Cardiovascular Effects: In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older with asthma, no significant differences were observed in the systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol (pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, potassium, and glucose) whether the salmeterol was given alone or as fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. In 72 adult and adolescent subjects with asthma given either fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg or fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, continuous 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring was performed after the first dose and after 12 weeks of therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: In a 28-week trial in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg twice daily was compared with the concurrent use of salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg plus fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg from separate inhalers or fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg alone. No significant differences across treatments were observed in serum cortisol AUC after 12 weeks of dosing or in 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion after 12 and 28 weeks. In a 12-week trial in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg twice daily was compared with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg alone, salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg alone, and placebo. For most subjects, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by 30-minute cosyntropin stimulation, remained intact with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. One subject (3%) who received fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg had an abnormal response (peak serum cortisol less than 18 mcg/dL) after dosing, compared with 2 subjects (6%) who received placebo, 2 subjects (6%) who received fluticasone propionate 250 mcg, and no subjects who received salmeterol. In a repeat-dose, 3-way crossover trial, 1 inhalation twice daily of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg, FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg (fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg), or placebo was administered to 20 adult and adolescent subjects with asthma. After 28 days of treatment, geometric mean serum cortisol AUC over 12 hours showed no significant difference between fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder and FLOVENT DISKUS or between either active treatment and placebo. Pediatric Subjects: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: In a 12-week trial in subjects with asthma aged 4 to 11 years who were receiving ICS at trial entry, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg twice daily was compared with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg administered twice daily via a dry powder inhaler. The values for 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion at trial entry and after 12 weeks of treatment were similar within each treatment group. After 12 weeks, 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion was also similar between the 2 groups. Subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Cardiovascular Effects: In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in subjects with COPD, no significant differences were seen in pulse rate, blood pressure, potassium, and glucose between fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, the individual components of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, and placebo. In a trial of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, 8 subjects (2 [1.1%] in the group given fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, 1 [0.5%] in the fluticasone propionate 250-mcg group, 3 [1.7%] in the salmeterol group, and 2 [1.1%] in the placebo group) had QTc intervals greater than 470 msec at least 1 time during the treatment period. Five (5) of these 8 subjects had a prolonged QTc interval at baseline. In a 24-week trial, 130 subjects with COPD received continuous 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring prior to the first dose and after 4 weeks of twice-daily treatment with either fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg, salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg, or placebo. No significant differences in ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias and heart rate were observed among the groups treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, the individual components, or placebo. One (1) subject in the fluticasone propionate group experienced atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation, and 1 subject in the group given fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg experienced heart block. There were 3 cases of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (1 each in the placebo, salmeterol, and fluticasone propionate 500-mcg treatment groups). In 24-week clinical trials in subjects with COPD, the incidence of clinically significant ECG abnormalities (myocardial ischemia, ventricular hypertrophy, clinically significant conduction abnormalities, clinically significant arrhythmias) was lower for subjects who received salmeterol (1%, 9 of 688 subjects who received either salmeterol 50 mcg or fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder) compared with placebo (3%, 10 of 370 subjects). No significant differences with salmeterol 50 mcg alone or in combination with fluticasone propionate as fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg were observed on pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a subset of subjects with COPD who underwent 12-hour serial vital sign measurements after the first dose (n = 183) and after 12 weeks of therapy (n = 149). Median changes from baseline in pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were similar to those seen with placebo. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: Short-cosyntropin stimulation testing was performed both at Day 1 and Endpoint in 101 subjects with COPD receiving twice-daily fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg, salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg, or placebo. For most subjects, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by short cosyntropin stimulation, remained intact with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg. One (1) subject (3%) who received fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg had an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol less than 14.5 mcg/dL assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography) after dosing, compared with 2 subjects (9%) who received fluticasone propionate 250 mcg, 2 subjects (7%) who received salmeterol 50 mcg, and 1 subject (4%) who received placebo following 24 weeks of treatment or early discontinuation from trial. After 36 weeks of dosing, serum cortisol concentrations in a subset of subjects with COPD (n = 83) were 22% lower in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg and 21% lower in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate 500 mcg than in subjects receiving placebo. Other Fluticasone Propionate Products Subjects with Asthma: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using dosages up to and including 250 mcg twice daily, occasional abnormal short cosyntropin tests (peak serum cortisol less than 18 mcg/dL assessed by radioimmunoassay) were noted both in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and in subjects receiving placebo. The incidence of abnormal tests at 500 mcg twice daily was greater than placebo. In a 2-year trial carried out with a dry powder inhaler in 64 subjects with mild, persistent asthma (mean FEV 1 91% of predicted) randomized to fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily or placebo, no subject receiving fluticasone propionate had an abnormal response to 6-hour cosyntropin infusion (peak serum cortisol less than 18 mcg/dL). With a peak cortisol threshold of less than 35 mcg/dL, 1 subject receiving fluticasone propionate (4%) had an abnormal response at 1 year; repeat testing at 18 months and 2 years was normal. Another subject receiving fluticasone propionate (5%) had an abnormal response at 2 years. No subject on placebo had an abnormal response at 1 or 2 years. Subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: After 4 weeks of dosing, the steady-state fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics and serum cortisol levels were described in a subset of subjects with COPD (n = 86) randomized to twice-daily fluticasone propionate inhalation powder via a dry powder inhaler 500 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg, or placebo. Serial serum cortisol concentrations were measured across a 12-hour dosing interval. Serum cortisol concentrations following 250- and 500-mcg twice-daily dosing were 10% and 21% lower than placebo, respectively, indicating a dose-dependent increase in systemic exposure to fluticasone propionate. Other Salmeterol Xinafoate Products Subjects with Asthma: Cardiovascular Effects: Inhaled salmeterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce dose-related cardiovascular effects and effects on blood glucose and/or serum potassium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 , 5.18 )] . The cardiovascular effects (heart rate, blood pressure) associated with salmeterol inhalation aerosol occur with similar frequency, and are of similar type and severity, as those noted following albuterol administration. The effects of rising inhaled doses of salmeterol and standard inhaled doses of albuterol were studied in volunteers and in subjects with asthma. Salmeterol doses up to 84 mcg administered as inhalation aerosol resulted in heart rate increases of 3 to 16 beats/min, about the same as albuterol dosed at 180 mcg by inhalation aerosol (4 to 10 beats/min). Adult and adolescent subjects receiving 50-mcg doses of salmeterol inhalation powder (N = 60) underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during two 12-hour periods after the first dose and after 1 month of therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted. Concomitant Use of Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Inhalation Powder with Other Respiratory Medicines Short-acting Beta 2 -agonists: In clinical trials in subjects with asthma, the mean daily need for albuterol by 166 adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older using fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder was approximately 1.3 inhalations/day and ranged from 0 to 9 inhalations/day. Five percent (5%) of subjects using fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in these trials averaged 6 or more inhalations per day over the course of the 12-week trials. No increase in frequency of cardiovascular adverse events was observed among subjects who averaged 6 or more inhalations per day. In a clinical trial in subjects with COPD, the mean daily need for albuterol for subjects using fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg was 4.1 inhalations/day. Twenty-six percent (26%) of subjects using fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg averaged 6 or more inhalations of albuterol per day over the course of the 24-week trial. No increase in frequency of cardiovascular adverse reactions was observed among subjects who averaged 6 or more inhalations per day. Methylxanthines: The concurrent use of intravenously or orally administered methylxanthines (e.g., aminophylline, theophylline) by adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder has not been completely evaluated. In clinical trials in subjects with asthma, 39 subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, or fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg twice daily concurrently with a theophylline product had adverse event rates similar to those in 304 subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder without theophylline. Similar results were observed in subjects receiving salmeterol 50 mcg plus fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily concurrently with a theophylline product (n = 39) or without theophylline (n = 132). In a clinical trial in subjects with COPD, 17 subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg twice daily concurrently with a theophylline product had adverse event rates similar to those in 161 subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder without theophylline. Based on the available data, the concomitant administration of methylxanthines with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder did not alter the observed adverse event profile. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray: In adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in clinical trials, no difference in the profile of adverse events or HPA axis effects was noted between subjects who were receiving FLONASE (fluticasone propionate) Nasal Spray, 50 mcg concurrently (n = 46) and those who were not (n = 130). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluticasone Propionate: Healthy Subjects: Fluticasone propionate acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate is negligible (less than 1%), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. In contrast, the majority of the fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung is systemically absorbed. Following administration of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder to healthy adult subjects, peak plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate were achieved in 1 to 2 hours. In a single-dose crossover trial, a higher-than-recommended dose of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder was administered to 14 healthy adult subjects. Two (2) inhalations of the following treatments were administered: fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg and salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg given concurrently, and fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg alone. Mean peak plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate averaged 107, 94, and 120 pg/mL, respectively, indicating no significant changes in systemic exposures of fluticasone propionate. In 15 healthy subjects, systemic exposure to fluticasone propionate from 4 inhalations of ADVAIR HFA 230/21 (fluticasone propionate 230 mcg and salmeterol 21 mcg) Inhalation Aerosol (920/84 mcg) and 2 inhalations of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg (1,000 mcg/100 mcg) was similar between the 2 inhalers (i.e., 799 versus 832 pg\u2022h/mL, respectively), but approximately half the systemic exposure from 4 inhalations of fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol 220 mcg (880 mcg, AUC = 1,543 pg\u2022h/mL). Similar results were observed for peak fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations (186 and 182 pg/mL from ADVAIR HFA and fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, respectively, and 307 pg/mL from the fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol). Absolute bioavailability of fluticasone propionate was 5.3% and 5.5% following administration of ADVAIR HFA and fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, respectively. Subjects with Asthma and COPD: Peak steady-state fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations in adult subjects with asthma (N = 11) ranged from undetectable to 266 pg/mL after a 500-mcg twice-daily dose of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using a dry powder inhaler. The mean fluticasone propionate plasma concentration was 110 pg/mL. Full pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained from 9 female and 16 male subjects with asthma given fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg twice daily using a dry powder inhaler and from 14 female and 43 male subjects with COPD given 250 or 500 mcg twice daily. No overall differences in fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics were observed. Peak steady-state fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations in subjects with COPD averaged 53 pg/mL (range: 19.3 to 159.3 pg/mL) after treatment with 250 mcg twice daily (n = 30) and 84 pg/mL (range: 24.3 to 197.1 pg/mL) after treatment with 500 mcg twice daily (n = 27) via a fluticasone propionate dry powder inhaler. In another trial in subjects with COPD, peak steady-state fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations averaged 115 pg/mL (range: 52.6 to 366.0 pg/mL) after treatment with 500 mcg twice daily via a fluticasone propionate dry powder inhaler (n = 15) and 105 pg/mL (range: 22.5 to 299.0 pg/mL) via fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder (n = 24). Salmeterol Xinafoate: Healthy Subjects: Salmeterol xinafoate, an ionic salt, dissociates in solution so that the salmeterol and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (xinafoate) moieties are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated independently. Salmeterol acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Following administration of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder to healthy adult subjects, peak plasma concentrations of salmeterol were achieved in about 5 minutes. In 15 healthy subjects receiving ADVAIR HFA 230/21 Inhalation Aerosol (920/84 mcg) and fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg (1,000 mcg/100 mcg), systemic exposure to salmeterol was higher (317 versus 169 pg\u2022h/mL) and peak salmeterol concentrations were lower (196 versus 223 pg/mL) following ADVAIR HFA compared with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, although pharmacodynamic results were comparable. Subjects with Asthma: Because of the small therapeutic dose, systemic levels of salmeterol are low or undetectable after inhalation of recommended dosages (50 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder twice daily). Following chronic administration of an inhaled dose of 50 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder twice daily, salmeterol was detected in plasma within 5 to 45 minutes in 7 subjects with asthma; plasma concentrations were very low, with mean peak concentrations of 167 pg/mL at 20 minutes and no accumulation with repeated doses. Distribution Fluticasone Propionate: Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averages 99%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Salmeterol: The percentage of salmeterol bound to human plasma proteins averages 96% in vitro over the concentration range of 8 to 7,722 ng of salmeterol base per milliliter, much higher concentrations than those achieved following therapeutic doses of salmeterol. Metabolism Fluticasone Propionate: The total clearance of fluticasone propionate is high (average, 1,093 mL/min), with renal clearance accounting for less than 0.02% of the total. The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Salmeterol: Salmeterol base is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation, with subsequent elimination predominantly in the feces. No significant amount of unchanged salmeterol base was detected in either urine or feces. An in vitro study using human liver microsomes showed that salmeterol is extensively metabolized to \u03b1-hydroxysalmeterol (aliphatic oxidation) by CYP3A4. Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, essentially completely inhibited the formation of \u03b1-hydroxysalmeterol in vitro . Elimination Fluticasone Propionate: Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Terminal half-life estimates of fluticasone propionate for ADVAIR HFA, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, and fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol were similar and averaged 5.6 hours. Salmeterol: In 2 healthy adult subjects who received 1 mg of radiolabeled salmeterol (as salmeterol xinafoate) orally, approximately 25% and 60% of the radiolabeled salmeterol was eliminated in urine and feces, respectively, over a period of 7 days. The terminal elimination half-life was about 5.5 hours (1 volunteer only). The xinafoate moiety has no apparent pharmacologic activity. The xinafoate moiety is highly protein bound (greater than 99%) and has a long elimination half-life of 11 days. No terminal half-life estimates were calculated for salmeterol following administration of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. Specific Populations A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol utilizing data from 9 controlled clinical trials that included 350 subjects with asthma aged 4 to 77 years who received treatment with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, the combination of HFA-propelled fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation aerosol (ADVAIR HFA), fluticasone propionate inhalation powder (FLOVENT DISKUS), HFA-propelled fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol (FLOVENT HFA), or CFC-propelled fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. The population pharmacokinetic analyses for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol showed no clinically relevant effects of age, gender, race, body weight, body mass index, or percent of predicted FEV 1 on apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution. Age: When the population pharmacokinetic analysis for fluticasone propionate was divided into subgroups based on fluticasone propionate strength, formulation, and age (adolescents/adults and children), there were some differences in fluticasone propionate exposure. Higher fluticasone propionate exposure from fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg compared with FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg was observed in adolescents and adults (ratio 1.52 [90% CI: 1.08, 2.13]). However, in clinical trials of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration comparing fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg and FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg in adolescents and adults, no differences in systemic effects of corticosteroid treatment (e.g., HPA axis effects) were observed. Similar fluticasone propionate exposure was observed from fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg and FLOVENT DISKUS 500 mcg (ratio 0.83 [90% CI: 0.65, 1.07]) in adolescents and adults. Steady-state systemic exposure to salmeterol when delivered as fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, or ADVAIR HFA 115/21 (fluticasone propionate 115 mcg and salmeterol 21 mcg) Inhalation Aerosol was evaluated in 127 subjects aged 4 to 57 years. The geometric mean AUC was 325 pg\u2022h/mL (90% CI: 309, 341) in adolescents and adults. The population pharmacokinetic analysis included 160 subjects with asthma aged 4 to 11 years who received fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg or FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg. Higher fluticasone propionate exposure (AUC) was observed in children from fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg compared with FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg (ratio 1.20 [90% CI: 1.06, 1.37]). Higher fluticasone propionate exposure (AUC) from fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg was observed in children compared with adolescents and adults (ratio 1.63 [90% CI: 1.35, 1.96]). However, in clinical trials of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration comparing fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg and FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg in both adolescents and adults and in children, no differences in systemic effects of corticosteroid treatment (e.g., HPA axis effects) were observed. Exposure to salmeterol was higher in children compared with adolescents and adults who received fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg (ratio 1.23 [90% CI: 1.10, 1.38]). However, in clinical trials of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg in both adolescents and adults and in children, no differences in systemic effects of beta 2 -agonist treatment (e.g., cardiovascular effects, tremor) were observed. Male and Female Patients: The population pharmacokinetic analysis involved 202 males and 148 females with asthma who received fluticasone propionate alone or in combination with salmeterol and showed no gender differences for fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. The population pharmacokinetic analysis involved 76 males and 51 females with asthma who received salmeterol in combination with fluticasone propionate and showed no gender differences for salmeterol pharmacokinetics. Patients with Hepatic and Renal Impairment: Formal pharmacokinetic studies using fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder have not been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, since both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol are predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. Drug Interaction Studies In the repeat- and single-dose trials, there was no evidence of significant drug interaction in systemic exposure between fluticasone propionate and salmeterol when given alone or in combination via a dry powder inhaler. The population pharmacokinetic analysis from 9 controlled clinical trials in 350 subjects with asthma showed no significant effects on fluticasone propionate or salmeterol pharmacokinetics following co-administration with beta 2 -agonists, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or theophyllines. Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 : Ritonavir: Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (less than 10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range: 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC (0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022h/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC (0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range: 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022h/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in serum cortisol AUC. Ketoconazole: Fluticasone Propionate: In a placebo-controlled crossover trial in 8 healthy adult volunteers, coadministration of a single dose of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) with multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg) to steady state resulted in increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, a reduction in plasma cortisol AUC, and no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. Salmeterol: In a placebo-controlled, crossover drug interaction trial in 20 healthy male and female subjects, coadministration of salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure as determined by a 16-fold increase in AUC (ratio with and without ketoconazole 15.76 [90% CI: 10.66, 23.31]) mainly due to increased bioavailability of the swallowed portion of the dose. Peak plasma salmeterol concentrations were increased by 1.4-fold (90% CI: 1.23, 1.68). Three (3) out of 20 subjects (15%) were withdrawn from salmeterol and ketoconazole coadministration due to beta-agonist\u2013mediated systemic effects (2 with QTc prolongation and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole did not result in a clinically significant effect on mean heart rate, mean blood potassium, or mean blood glucose. Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration. Erythromycin: Fluticasone Propionate: In a multiple-dose drug interaction trial, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg 3 times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. Salmeterol: In a repeat-dose trial in 13 healthy subjects, concomitant administration of erythromycin (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) and salmeterol inhalation aerosol resulted in a 40% increase in salmeterol C max at steady state (ratio with and without erythromycin 1.4 [90% CI: 0.96, 2.03], P = 0.12), a 3.6-beat/min increase in heart rate ([95% CI: 0.19, 7.03], P less than 0.04), a 5.8-msec increase in QTc interval ([95% CI: -6.14, 17.77], P = 0.34), and no change in plasma potassium."], "manufacturer_name": ["Preferred Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "substance_name": ["FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE", "SALMETEROL XINAFOATE"], "effective_time": "20250516", "product_ndc": ["68788-8453"], "brand_name": ["fluticasone propionate and salmeterol"]}

The ASMANEX TWISTHALER 110 mcg and 220 mcg products are cap-activated, inhalation-driven, multidose dry powder inhalers containing mometasone furoate and anhydrous lactose (which contains trace amounts of milk proteins). Each actuation of the ASMANEX TWISTHALER 110 mcg or 220 mcg inhaler provides a measured dose of approximately 0.75 or 1.5 mg mometasone furoate inhalation powder, containing 110 or 220 mcg of mometasone furoate, respectively. This results in delivery of 100 or 200 mcg mometasone furoate from the mouthpiece, respectively, based on in vitro testing at flow rates of 30 L/min and 60 L/min with constant volume of 2 L. The amount of mometasone furoate emitted from the inhaler in vitro does not differ significantly for flow rates ranging from 28.3 L/min to 70 L/min at a constant volume of 2 L. However, the amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors such as inspiratory flow and peak inspiratory flow through the device.

The precise mechanism of corticosteroid action on asthma is not known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of inhibitory effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation and in the asthmatic response. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Mometasone furoate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor, which is approximately 12 times that of dexamethasone, 7 times that of triamcinolone acetonide, 5 times that of budesonide, and 1.5 times that of fluticasone. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. Maximum improvement in symptoms following inhaled administration of mometasone furoate may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When corticosteroids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Adrenal Function: The effects of ASMANEX TWISTHALER on adrenal function have been evaluated in 2 clinical studies: 1 in adults 18 years of age and older and 1 in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age. Both clinical studies were specifically designed to assess the effect of ASMANEX TWISTHALER on adrenal function. In a 29-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 64 adult and adolescent patients 18 years of age and older with asthma, ASMANEX TWISTHALER 440 mcg twice daily and 880 mcg twice daily (twice the highest recommended daily dose) were compared to both placebo and prednisone 10 mg once daily as a positive control. The 30-minute post-Cosyntropin stimulation serum cortisol concentration on Day 29 was 23.2 mcg/dL for the ASMANEX 440 mcg twice daily group (n=16) and 20.8 mcg/dL for the ASMANEX 880 mcg twice daily group (n=16), compared to 14.5 mcg/dL for the oral prednisone 10-mg group (n=16) and 25 mcg/dL for the placebo group (n=16). The difference between ASMANEX 880 mcg twice daily (twice the maximum recommended dose) and placebo was statistically significant. In a 29-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial in 50 pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age with asthma, ASMANEX TWISTHALER 110 mcg twice daily, 220 mcg twice daily, and 440 mcg twice daily (2-8 times the highest pediatric daily recommended daily dose) were compared to placebo. HPA-axis function was assessed by 12-hour plasma cortisol AUC and 24-hour urinary-free cortisol concentrations. After 29 days of treatment, the mean changes in plasma cortisol AUC 0\u201312h from baseline were -0.11, -19.5, -21.3, and -3.47 mcg\u2022hr/dL for the treatment groups of ASMANEX TWISTHALER 110 mcg twice daily (n=12), 220 mcg twice daily (n=12), 440 mcg twice daily (n=11), and placebo (n=7), respectively. The mean differences from placebo in the groups treated with ASMANEX TWISTHALER 110 mcg twice daily, 220 mcg twice daily, and 440 mcg twice daily were 3.4 mcg\u2022hr/dL (95% CI: -14.0, 20.7), -16.0 mcg\u2022hr/dL (95% CI: -33.9, 1.9), and -17.9 mcg\u2022hr/dL (95% CI: -35.8, 0.0), respectively. For 24-hour urinary-free cortisol, after 29 days of treatment, the mean changes from baseline were -1.53, -1.33, -6.70, and -4.68 mcg/day for the groups treated with ASMANEX TWISTHALER 110 mcg twice daily (n=12), 220 mcg twice daily (n=12), 440 mcg twice daily (n=12), and placebo (n=10), respectively. The mean differences in urinary-free cortisol changes from baseline compared to placebo were 3.1 mcg/day (95% CI: -3.3, 9.6), 3.3 mcg/day (95% CI: -3.0, 9.7), and -2.0 mcg/day (95% CI: -8.6, 4.6) for the groups treated with 110 mcg twice daily, 220 mcg twice daily, and 440 mcg twice daily, respectively. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Following a 1000 mcg inhaled dose of tritiated mometasone furoate inhalation powder to 6 healthy human subjects, plasma concentrations of unchanged mometasone furoate were shown to be very low compared to the total radioactivity in plasma. Following an inhaled single 400 mcg dose of ASMANEX TWISTHALER treatment to 24 healthy subjects, plasma concentrations for most subjects were near or below the lower limit of quantitation for the assay (50 pcg/mL). The mean absolute systemic bioavailability of the above single inhaled 400 mcg dose, compared to an intravenous 400 mcg dose of mometasone furoate, was determined to be less than 1%. Following administration of the recommended highest inhaled dose (400 mcg twice daily) to 64 patients for 28 days, concentration-time profiles were discernible, but with large intersubject variability. The coefficient of variation for C max and AUC ranged from approximately 50% to 100%. The mean peak plasma concentrations at steady state ranged from approximately 94 to 114 pcg/mL and the mean time to peak levels ranged from approximately 1.0 to 2.5 hours. Distribution: Based on the study employing a 1000 mcg inhaled dose of tritiated mometasone furoate inhalation powder in humans, no appreciable accumulation of mometasone furoate in the red blood cells was found. Following an intravenous 400 mcg dose of mometasone furoate, the plasma concentrations showed a biphasic decline, with a mean terminal half-life of about 5 hours and the mean steady-state volume of distribution of 152 L. The in vitro protein binding for mometasone furoate was reported to be 98% to 99% (in a concentration range of 5\u2013500 ng/mL). Elimination: Metabolism: Studies have shown that mometasone furoate is primarily and extensively metabolized in the liver of all species investigated and undergoes extensive metabolism to multiple metabolites. In vitro studies have confirmed the primary role of CYP3A4 in the metabolism of this compound; however, no major metabolites were identified. Excretion: Following an intravenous dosing, the terminal half-life was reported to be about 5 hours. Following the inhaled dose of tritiated 1000 mcg mometasone furoate, the radioactivity is excreted mainly in the feces (a mean of 74%), and to a small extent in the urine (a mean of 8%) up to 7 days. No radioactivity was associated with unchanged mometasone furoate in the urine. Specific Populations: Pharmacokinetics have not been adequately investigated with ASMANEX TWISTHALER by gender, race or in pediatric patients. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Administration of a single inhaled dose of 400 mcg mometasone furoate to subjects with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment resulted in only 1 or 2 subjects in each group having detectable peak plasma concentrations of mometasone furoate (ranging from 50\u2013105 pcg/mL). The observed peak plasma concentrations appear to increase with severity of hepatic impairment; however, the numbers of detectable levels were few. Patients with Renal Impairment: The effects of renal impairment on mometasone furoate pharmacokinetics have not been adequately investigated. Drug Interaction Studies : Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4: In a drug interaction study, an inhaled dose of mometasone furoate 400 mcg was given to 24 healthy subjects twice daily for 9 days and ketoconazole 200 mg (as well as placebo) were given twice daily concomitantly on Days 4 to 9. Mometasone furoate plasma concentrations were <150 pcg/mL on Day 3 prior to coadministration of ketoconazole or placebo. Following concomitant administration of ketoconazole, 4 out of 12 subjects in the ketoconazole treatment group (n=12) had peak plasma concentrations of mometasone furoate >200 pcg/mL on Day 9 (211\u2013324 pcg/mL)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Organon LLC"], "substance_name": ["MOMETASONE FUROATE"], "effective_time": "20250211", "product_ndc": ["78206-114", "78206-115"], "brand_name": ["ASMANEX"]}

Budesonide is provided as a mixture of two epimers (22R and 22S). The empirical formula of budesonide is C 25 H 34 O 6 and its molecular weight is 430.5. Its structural formula is: Budesonide is a white to off-white, tasteless, odorless powder that is practically insoluble in water and in heptane, sparingly soluble in ethanol, and freely soluble in chloroform. Its partition coefficient between octanol and water at pH 7.4 is 1.6 x 10 3 . PULMICORT FLEXHALER is an inhalation-driven multi-dose dry powder inhaler containing a formulation of 1 mg per actuation of micronized budesonide and micronized lactose monohydrate which contains trace levels of milk proteins [see Contraindications (4) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Each actuation of PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg delivers 160 mcg budesonide from the mouthpiece and each actuation of PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg delivers 80 mcg budesonide from the mouthpiece (based on in vitro testing at 60 L/min for 2 sec). Each PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg contains 120 actuations and each PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg contains 60 actuations. In vitro testing has shown that the dose delivery for PULMICORT FLEXHALER is dependent on airflow through the device, as evidenced by a decrease in the fine particle dose at a flow rate of 30 L/min to a value that is approximately 40-50% of that produced at 60 L/min. At a flow rate of 40 L/min, the fine particle dose is approximately 70% of that produced at 60 L/min. Patient factors such as inspiratory flow rates will also affect the dose delivered to the lungs of patients in actual use [see Patient Information and Instructions for Use ] . In asthmatic children age 6 to 17 (N=516, FEV 1 2.29 [0.97\u2013 4.28]) peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through PULMICORT FLEXHALER was 72.5 [19.1 \u2013 103.6] L/min). Inspiratory flows were not measured in the adult pivotal study. Patients should be carefully instructed on the use of this drug product to assure optimal dose delivery. structural formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. In standard in vitro and animal models, budesonide has approximately a 200-fold higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency than cortisol (rat croton oil ear edema assay). As a measure of systemic activity, budesonide is 40 times more potent than cortisol when administered subcutaneously and 25 times more potent when administered orally in the rat thymus involution assay. The clinical significance of this is unknown. The activity of PULMICORT FLEXHALER is due to the parent drug, budesonide. In glucocorticoid receptor affinity studies, the 22R form was two times as active as the 22S epimer. In vitro studies indicated that the two forms of budesonide do not interconvert. The precise mechanism of corticosteroid actions on inflammation in asthma is not known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic-mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Studies in asthmatic patients have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects over a wide range of doses of inhaled budesonide. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, extensive first pass hepatic degradation of orally absorbed drug (85-95%), and the low potency of formed metabolites (see below). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics To confirm that systemic absorption is not a significant factor in the clinical efficacy of inhaled budesonide, a clinical study in patients with asthma was performed comparing 400 mcg budesonide administered via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler with a tube spacer to 1400 mcg of oral budesonide and placebo. The study demonstrated the efficacy of inhaled budesonide but not orally administered budesonide, even though systemic budesonide exposure was comparable for both treatments, indicating that the inhaled treatment is working locally in the lung. Thus, the therapeutic effect of conventional doses of orally inhaled budesonide are largely explained by its direct action on the respiratory tract. Inhaled budesonide has been shown to decrease airway reactivity in various challenge models, including histamine, methacholine, sodium metabisulfite, and adenosine monophosphate in patients with hyperreactive airways. The clinical relevance of these models is not certain. Pre-treatment with inhaled budesonide 1600 mcg daily (800 mcg twice daily) for 2 weeks reduced the acute (early-phase reaction) and delayed (late-phase reaction) decrease in FEV 1 following inhaled allergen challenge. HPA Axis effects: The effects of inhaled budesonide on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were studied in 905 adults and 404 pediatric patients with asthma. For most patients, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test, remained intact with inhaled budesonide treatment at recommended doses. For adult patients treated with 100, 200, 400, or 800 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks, 4%, 2%, 6%, and 13% respectively, had an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol <14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography following short-cosyntropin test) as compared with 8% of patients treated with placebo. Similar results were obtained in pediatric patients. In another study in adults, doses of 400, 800 and 1600 mcg of inhaled budesonide twice daily for 6 weeks were examined; 1600 mcg twice daily (twice the maximum recommended dose) resulted in a 27% reduction in stimulated cortisol (6-hour ACTH infusion) while 10 mg prednisone resulted in a 35% reduction. In this study, no patient taking doses of 400 and 800 mcg twice daily met the criterion for an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol <14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography) following ACTH infusion. An open-label, long-term follow-up of 1133 patients for up to 52 weeks confirmed the minimal effect on the HPA axis (both basal and stimulated plasma cortisol) of inhaled budesonide when administered at doses ranging from 100 to 800 mcg twice daily. In patients who had previously been oral steroid-dependent, use of inhaled budesonide at doses ranging from 100 to 800 mcg twice daily was associated with higher stimulated cortisol response compared with baseline following 1 year of therapy. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of budesonide, peak plasma concentration was achieved in about 1 to 2 hours and the absolute systemic availability was 6-13%. In contrast, most of budesonide delivered to the lungs is systemically absorbed. In healthy subjects, 34% of the metered dose was deposited in the lungs (as assessed by plasma concentration method and using a different budesonide containing dry-powder inhaler) with an absolute systemic availability of 39% of the metered dose. Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide delivered from PULMICORT FLEXHALER in adults with asthma (n=39) occurred at approximately 10 minutes post-dose and averaged 0.6 and 1.6 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg once daily and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively. In asthmatic patients, budesonide showed a linear increase in AUC and C max with increasing dose after both a single dose and repeated dosing of inhaled budesonide. Distribution The volume of distribution of budesonide was approximately 3 L/kg. It was 85-90% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding was constant over the concentration range (1-100 nmol/L) achieved with, and exceeding, recommended doses of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Budesonide showed little or no binding to corticosteroid binding globulin. Budesonide rapidly equilibrated with red blood cells in a concentration independent manner with a blood/plasma ratio of about 0.8. Metabolism In vitro studies with human liver homogenates have shown that budesonide is rapidly and extensively metabolized. Two major metabolites formed via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) catalyzed biotransformation have been isolated and identified as 16\u03b1-hydroxyprednisolone and 6\u03b2-hydroxybudesonide. The corticosteroid activity of each of these two metabolites is less than 1% of that of the parent compound. No qualitative differences between the in vitro and in vivo metabolic patterns have been detected. Negligible metabolic inactivation was observed in human lung and serum preparations. Excretion/Elimination The 22R form of budesonide was preferentially cleared by the liver with systemic clearance of 1.4 L/min vs. 1.0 L/min for the 22S form. The terminal half-life, 2 to 3 hours, was the same for both epimers and was independent of dose. Budesonide was excreted in urine and feces in the form of metabolites. Approximately 60% of an intravenous radiolabeled dose was recovered in the urine. No unchanged budesonide was detected in the urine. Special Populations No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences have been identified due to race, sex, or advanced age. Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in geriatric patients have not been specifically studied. Pediatric Following intravenous dosing in pediatric patients age 10-14 years, plasma half-life was shorter than in adults (1.5 hours vs. 2.0 hours in adults). In the same population following inhalation of budesonide via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler, absolute systemic availability was similar to that in adults. Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide delivered via PULMICORT FLEXHALER in children and adolescents with asthma (n=14) occurred at approximately 15 to 30 minutes post-dose and averaged 0.4 and 1.5 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg once daily and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively. Nursing Mothers The disposition of budesonide when delivered by inhalation from a dry powder inhaler at doses of 200 or 400 mcg twice daily for at least 3 months was studied in eight lactating women with asthma from 1 to 6 months postpartum. Systemic exposure to budesonide in these women appears to be comparable to that in non-lactating women with asthma from other studies. Breast milk obtained over eight hours post-dose revealed that the maximum concentration of budesonide for the 400 and 800 mcg doses was 0.39 and 0.78 nmol/L, respectively, and occurred within 45 minutes after dosing. The estimated oral daily dose of budesonide from breast milk to the infant is approximately 0.007 and 0.014 mcg/kg/day for the two dose regimens used in this study, which represents approximately 0.3% to 1% of the dose inhaled by the mother. Budesonide levels in plasma samples obtained from five infants at about 90 minutes after breastfeeding (and about 140 minutes after drug administration to the mother) were below quantifiable levels (<0.02 nmol/L in four infants and <0.04 nmol/L in one infant) [see Use In Specific Populations (8.2) ] . Renal or Hepatic Insufficiency There are no data regarding the specific use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Reduced liver function may affect the elimination of corticosteroids. The pharmacokinetics of budesonide were affected by compromised liver function as evidenced by a doubled systemic availability after oral ingestion. The intravenous pharmacokinetics of budesonide were, however, similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Drug-Drug Interactions Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), the main metabolic enzyme for corticosteroids, increased plasma levels of orally ingested budesonide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] .

This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, extensive first pass hepatic degradation of orally absorbed drug (85-95%), and the low potency of formed metabolites (see below). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics To confirm that systemic absorption is not a significant factor in the clinical efficacy of inhaled budesonide, a clinical study in patients with asthma was performed comparing 400 mcg budesonide administered via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler with a tube spacer to 1400 mcg of oral budesonide and placebo. The study demonstrated the efficacy of inhaled budesonide but not orally administered budesonide, even though systemic budesonide exposure was comparable for both treatments, indicating that the inhaled treatment is working locally in the lung. Thus, the therapeutic effect of conventional doses of orally inhaled budesonide are largely explained by its direct action on the respiratory tract. Inhaled budesonide has been shown to decrease airway reactivity in various challenge models, including histamine, methacholine, sodium metabisulfite, and adenosine monophosphate in patients with hyperreactive airways. The clinical relevance of these models is not certain. Pre-treatment with inhaled budesonide 1600 mcg daily (800 mcg twice daily) for 2 weeks reduced the acute (early-phase reaction) and delayed (late-phase reaction) decrease in FEV 1 following inhaled allergen challenge. HPA Axis effects: The effects of inhaled budesonide on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were studied in 905 adults and 404 pediatric patients with asthma. For most patients, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test, remained intact with inhaled budesonide treatment at recommended doses. For adult patients treated with 100, 200, 400, or 800 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks, 4%, 2%, 6%, and 13% respectively, had an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol <14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography following short-cosyntropin test) as compared with 8% of patients treated with placebo. Similar results were obtained in pediatric patients. In another study in adults, doses of 400, 800 and 1600 mcg of inhaled budesonide twice daily for 6 weeks were examined; 1600 mcg twice daily (twice the maximum recommended dose) resulted in a 27% reduction in stimulated cortisol (6-hour ACTH infusion) while 10 mg prednisone resulted in a 35% reduction. In this study, no patient taking doses of 400 and 800 mcg twice daily met the criterion for an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol <14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography) following ACTH infusion. An open-label, long-term follow-up of 1133 patients for up to 52 weeks confirmed the minimal effect on the HPA axis (both basal and stimulated plasma cortisol) of inhaled budesonide when administered at doses ranging from 100 to 800 mcg twice daily. In patients who had previously been oral steroid-dependent, use of inhaled budesonide at doses ranging from 100 to 800 mcg twice daily was associated with higher stimulated cortisol response compared with baseline following 1 year of therapy. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of budesonide, peak plasma concentration was achieved in about 1 to 2 hours and the absolute systemic availability was 6-13%. In contrast, most of budesonide delivered to the lungs is systemically absorbed. In healthy subjects, 34% of the metered dose was deposited in the lungs (as assessed by plasma concentration method and using a different budesonide containing dry-powder inhaler) with an absolute systemic availability of 39% of the metered dose. Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide delivered from PULMICORT FLEXHALER in adults with asthma (n=39) occurred at approximately 10 minutes post-dose and averaged 0.6 and 1.6 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg once daily and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively. In asthmatic patients, budesonide showed a linear increase in AUC and C max with increasing dose after both a single dose and repeated dosing of inhaled budesonide. Distribution The volume of distribution of budesonide was approximately 3 L/kg. It was 85-90% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding was constant over the concentration range (1-100 nmol/L) achieved with, and exceeding, recommended doses of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Budesonide showed little or no binding to corticosteroid binding globulin. Budesonide rapidly equilibrated with red blood cells in a concentration independent manner with a blood/plasma ratio of about 0.8. Metabolism In vitro studies with human liver homogenates have shown that budesonide is rapidly and extensively metabolized. Two major metabolites formed via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) catalyzed biotransformation have been isolated and identified as 16\u03b1-hydroxyprednisolone and 6\u03b2-hydroxybudesonide. The corticosteroid activity of each of these two metabolites is less than 1% of that of the parent compound. No qualitative differences between the in vitro and in vivo metabolic patterns have been detected. Negligible metabolic inactivation was observed in human lung and serum preparations. Excretion/Elimination The 22R form of budesonide was preferentially cleared by the liver with systemic clearance of 1.4 L/min vs. 1.0 L/min for the 22S form. The terminal half-life, 2 to 3 hours, was the same for both epimers and was independent of dose. Budesonide was excreted in urine and feces in the form of metabolites. Approximately 60% of an intravenous radiolabeled dose was recovered in the urine. No unchanged budesonide was detected in the urine. Special Populations No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences have been identified due to race, sex, or advanced age. Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in geriatric patients have not been specifically studied. Pediatric Following intravenous dosing in pediatric patients age 10-14 years, plasma half-life was shorter than in adults (1.5 hours vs. 2.0 hours in adults). In the same population following inhalation of budesonide via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler, absolute systemic availability was similar to that in adults. Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide delivered via PULMICORT FLEXHALER in children and adolescents with asthma (n=14) occurred at approximately 15 to 30 minutes post-dose and averaged 0.4 and 1.5 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg once daily and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively. Nursing Mothers The disposition of budesonide when delivered by inhalation from a dry powder inhaler at doses of 200 or 400 mcg twice daily for at least 3 months was studied in eight lactating women with asthma from 1 to 6 months postpartum. Systemic exposure to budesonide in these women appears to be comparable to that in non-lactating women with asthma from other studies. Breast milk obtained over eight hours post-dose revealed that the maximum concentration of budesonide for the 400 and 800 mcg doses was 0.39 and 0.78 nmol/L, respectively, and occurred within 45 minutes after dosing. The estimated oral daily dose of budesonide from breast milk to the infant is approximately 0.007 and 0.014 mcg/kg/day for the two dose regimens used in this study, which represents approximately 0.3% to 1% of the dose inhaled by the mother. Budesonide levels in plasma samples obtained from five infants at about 90 minutes after breastfeeding (and about 140 minutes after drug administration to the mother) were below quantifiable levels (<0.02 nmol/L in four infants and <0.04 nmol/L in one infant) [see Use In Specific Populations (8.2) ] . Renal or Hepatic Insufficiency There are no data regarding the specific use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Reduced liver function may affect the elimination of corticosteroids. The pharmacokinetics of budesonide were affected by compromised liver function as evidenced by a doubled systemic availability after oral ingestion. The intravenous pharmacokinetics of budesonide were, however, similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Drug-Drug Interactions Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), the main metabolic enzyme for corticosteroids, increased plasma levels of orally ingested budesonide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] .

( 1.1 , 1.3 ) 1.1 Treatment of Asthma SEREVENT DISKUS is indicated for the treatment of asthma and in the prevention of bronchospasm only as concomitant therapy with an ICS in patients aged 4 years and older with reversible obstructive airway disease, including patients with symptoms of nocturnal asthma. LABA, such as salmeterol, the active ingredient in SEREVENT DISKUS, as monotherapy (without ICS) increase the risk of asthma-related death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Use of SEREVENT DISKUS for the treatment of asthma without concomitant use of an ICS is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Use SEREVENT DISKUS only as additional therapy for patients with asthma who are currently taking but are inadequately controlled on an ICS. Do not use SEREVENT DISKUS for patients whose asthma is adequately controlled on low- or medium-dose ICS. Pediatric and Adolescent Patients Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that LABA as monotherapy increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. For pediatric and adolescent patients with asthma who require addition of a LABA to an ICS, a fixed-dose combination product containing both an ICS and a LABA should ordinarily be used to ensure adherence with both drugs. In cases where use of a separate ICS and a LABA is clinically indicated, appropriate steps must be taken to ensure adherence with both treatment components. If adherence cannot be assured, a fixed-dose combination product containing both an ICS and a LABA is recommended. Important Limitation of Use SEREVENT DISKUS is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. 1.2 Prevention of Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm SEREVENT DISKUS is also indicated for prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) in patients aged 4 years and older. Use of SEREVENT DISKUS as a single agent for the prevention of EIB may be clinically indicated in patients who do not have persistent asthma. In patients with persistent asthma, use of SEREVENT DISKUS for the prevention of EIB may be clinically indicated, but the treatment of asthma should include an ICS. 1.3 Maintenance Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease SEREVENT DISKUS is indicated for the long-term twice-daily administration in the maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis).

Salmeterol xinafoate is the racemic form of the 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid salt of salmeterol. It has the chemical name 4-hydroxy-\u03b1 1 -[[[6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexyl]amino]methyl]-1,3-benzenedimethanol, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthalenecarboxylate and the following chemical structure: Salmeterol xinafoate is a white powder with a molecular weight of 603.8, and the empirical formula is C 25 H 37 NO 4 \u2022C 11 H 8 O 3 . It is freely soluble in methanol; slightly soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and isopropanol; and sparingly soluble in water. SEREVENT DISKUS is a teal green plastic inhaler containing a foil blister strip. Each blister on the strip contains a white powder mix of micronized salmeterol xinafoate salt (72.5 mcg, equivalent to 50 mcg of salmeterol base) in 12.5 mg of formulation containing lactose monohydrate (which contains milk proteins). After the inhaler is activated, the powder is dispersed into the airstream created by the patient inhaling through the mouthpiece. Under standardized in vitro test conditions, SEREVENT DISKUS delivers 47 mcg of salmeterol base per blister when tested at a flow rate of 60 L/min for 2 seconds. In adult subjects with obstructive lung disease and severely compromised lung function (mean FEV 1 20% to 30% of predicted), mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the DISKUS inhaler was 82.4 L/min (range: 46.1 to 115.3 L/min). The actual amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors, such as inspiratory flow profile. Salmeterol chemical structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Salmeterol is a selective LABA. In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta 2 -adrenoceptors than albuterol. Although beta 2 -adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta 1 -adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta 2 -adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta 2 -agonists may have cardiac effects. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including salmeterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3\u2032,5\u2032-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. In vitro tests show that salmeterol is a potent and long-lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D 2 , from human lung. Salmeterol inhibits histamine-induced plasma protein extravasation and inhibits platelet-activating factor\u2013induced eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of guinea pigs when administered by the inhaled route. In humans, single doses of salmeterol administered via inhalation aerosol attenuate allergen-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Inhaled salmeterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce dose-related cardiovascular effects and effects on blood glucose and/or serum potassium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 , 5.10 )] . The cardiovascular effects (heart rate, blood pressure) associated with salmeterol inhalation aerosol occur with similar frequency, and are of similar type and severity, as those noted following albuterol administration. The effects of rising inhaled doses of salmeterol and standard inhaled doses of albuterol were studied in volunteers and in subjects with asthma. Salmeterol doses up to 84 mcg administered as inhalation aerosol resulted in heart rate increases of 3 to 16 beats/min, about the same as albuterol dosed at 180 mcg by inhalation aerosol (4 to 10 beats/min). Adult and adolescent subjects receiving 50-mcg doses of salmeterol inhalation powder (n = 60) underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during two 12-hour periods after the first dose and after 1 month of therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted. Also, pediatric patients receiving 50-mcg doses of salmeterol inhalation powder (n = 67) underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during two 12-hour periods after the first dose and after 3 months of therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted. In 24-week clinical studies in patients with COPD, the incidence of clinically significant abnormalities on the predose ECGs at Weeks 12 and 24 in patients who received salmeterol 50 mcg was not different compared with placebo. No effect of treatment with salmeterol 50 mcg was observed on pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a subset of patients with COPD who underwent 12-hour serial vital sign measurements after the first dose (n = 91) and after 12 weeks of therapy (n = 74). Median changes from baseline in pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were similar for patients receiving either salmeterol or placebo [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Concomitant Use of SEREVENT DISKUS with Other Respiratory Medications Short-acting Beta 2 -agonists: In two 12-week repetitive-dose clinical trials in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma (N = 149), the mean daily need for additional beta 2 -agonist in subjects using SEREVENT DISKUS was approximately 1\u00bd inhalations/day. Twenty-six percent (26%) of the subjects in these trials used between 8 and 24 inhalations of short-acting beta-agonist per day on 1 or more occasions. Nine percent (9%) of the subjects in these trials averaged over 4 inhalations/day over the course of the 12-week trials. No increase in frequency of cardiovascular events was observed among the 3 subjects who averaged 8 to 11 inhalations/day; however, the safety of concomitant use of more than 8 inhalations/day of short-acting beta 2 -agonist with SEREVENT DISKUS has not been established. In 29 subjects who experienced worsening of asthma while receiving SEREVENT DISKUS during these trials, albuterol therapy administered via either nebulizer or inhalation aerosol (1 dose in most cases) led to improvement in FEV 1 and no increase in occurrence of cardiovascular adverse events. In 2 clinical trials in subjects with COPD, the mean daily need for additional beta 2 -agonist for subjects using SEREVENT DISKUS was approximately 4 inhalations/day. Twenty-four percent (24%) of subjects using SEREVENT DISKUS averaged 6 or more inhalations of albuterol per day over the course of the 24-week trials. No increase in frequency of cardiovascular adverse reactions was observed among subjects who averaged 6 or more inhalations per day. Methylxanthines: The concurrent use of intravenously or orally administered methylxanthines (e.g., aminophylline, theophylline) by subjects receiving salmeterol has not been completely evaluated. In 1 clinical trial in subjects with asthma, 87 subjects receiving SEREVENT Inhalation Aerosol 42 mcg twice daily concurrently with a theophylline product had adverse event rates similar to those in 71 subjects receiving SEREVENT Inhalation Aerosol without theophylline. Resting heart rates were slightly higher in the subjects on theophylline but were little affected by therapy with SEREVENT Inhalation Aerosol. In 2 clinical trials in subjects with COPD, 39 subjects receiving SEREVENT DISKUS concurrently with a theophylline product had adverse event rates similar to those in 302 subjects receiving SEREVENT DISKUS without theophylline. Based on the available data, the concomitant administration of methylxanthines with SEREVENT DISKUS did not alter the observed adverse event profile. Cromoglycate: In clinical trials, inhaled cromolyn sodium did not alter the safety profile of salmeterol when administered concurrently. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Salmeterol xinafoate, an ionic salt, dissociates in solution so that the salmeterol and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (xinafoate) moieties are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated independently. Salmeterol acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Absorption Because of the small therapeutic dose, systemic levels of salmeterol are low or undetectable after inhalation of recommended doses (50 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder twice daily). Following chronic administration of an inhaled dose of 50 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder twice daily, salmeterol was detected in plasma within 5 to 45 minutes in 7 subjects with asthma; plasma concentrations were very low, with mean peak concentrations of 167 pg/mL at 20 minutes and no accumulation with repeated doses. Distribution The percentage of salmeterol bound to human plasma proteins averages 96% in vitro over the concentration range of 8 to 7,722 ng of salmeterol base per milliliter, much higher concentrations than those achieved following therapeutic doses of salmeterol. Metabolism Salmeterol base is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation, with subsequent elimination predominantly in the feces. No significant amount of unchanged salmeterol base was detected in either urine or feces. An in vitro study using human liver microsomes showed that salmeterol is extensively metabolized to \u03b1-hydroxysalmeterol (aliphatic oxidation) by CYP3A4. Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, essentially completely inhibited the formation of \u03b1-hydroxysalmeterol in vitro. Elimination In 2 healthy adult subjects who received 1 mg of radiolabeled salmeterol (as salmeterol xinafoate) orally, approximately 25% and 60% of the radiolabeled salmeterol was eliminated in urine and feces, respectively, over a period of 7 days. The terminal elimination half-life was about 5.5 hours (1 volunteer only). The xinafoate moiety has no apparent pharmacologic activity. The xinafoate moiety is highly protein bound (>99%) and has a long elimination half-life of 11 days. Drug Interaction Studies Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4: Ketoconazole: In a placebo-controlled crossover drug interaction trial in 20 healthy male and female subjects, coadministration of salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure as determined by a 16-fold increase in AUC (ratio with and without ketoconazole 15.76 [90% CI: 10.66, 23.31]) mainly due to increased bioavailability of the swallowed portion of the dose. Peak plasma salmeterol concentrations were increased by 1.4-fold (90% CI: 1.23, 1.68). Three (3) out of 20 subjects (15%) were withdrawn from salmeterol and ketoconazole coadministration due to beta-agonist\u2013mediated systemic effects (2 with QTc prolongation and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole did not result in a clinically significant effect on mean heart rate, mean blood potassium, or mean blood glucose. Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration. Erythromycin: In a repeat-dose trial in 13 healthy subjects, concomitant administration of erythromycin (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) and salmeterol inhalation aerosol resulted in a 40% increase in salmeterol C max at steady state (ratio with and without erythromycin 1.4 [90% CI: 0.96, 2.03], P = 0.12), a 3.6-beat/min increase in heart rate ([95% CI: 0.19, 7.03], P <0.04), a 5.8-msec increase in QTc interval ([95% CI: -6.14, 17.77], P = 0.34), and no change in plasma potassium."], "manufacturer_name": ["GlaxoSmithKline LLC"], "substance_name": ["SALMETEROL XINAFOATE"], "effective_time": "20221010", "product_ndc": ["0173-0521"], "brand_name": ["SEREVENT DISKUS"]}

Isoflurane evokes a sigh response reminiscent of that seen with diethyl ether and enflurane, although the frequency is less than with enflurane. Blood pressure decreases with induction of anesthesia but returns toward normal with surgical stimulation. Progressive increases in depth of anesthesia produce corresponding decreases in blood pressure. Nitrous oxide diminishes the inspiratory concentration of isoflurane required to reach a desired level of anesthesia and may reduce the arterial hypotension seen with isoflurane alone. Heart rhythm is remarkably stable. With controlled ventilation and normal PaCO 2 , cardiac output is maintained despite increasing depth of anesthesia, primarily through an increase in heart rate which compensates for a reduction in stroke volume. The hypercapnia which attends spontaneous ventilation during isoflurane anesthesia further increases heart rate and raises cardiac output above awake levels. Muscle relaxation is often adequate for intra-abdominal operations at normal levels of anesthesia. Complete muscle paralysis can be attained with small doses of muscle relaxants. ALL COMMONLY USED MUSCLE RELAXANTS ARE MARKEDLY POTENTIATED WITH ISOFLURANE, THE EFFECT BEING MOST PROFOUND WITH THE NONDEPOLARIZING TYPE. Neostigmine reverses the effect of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants in the presence of isoflurane. All commonly used muscle relaxants are compatible with isoflurane. Isoflurane can produce coronary vasodilation at the arteriolar level in selected animal models; the drug is probably also a coronary dilator in humans. Isoflurane, like some other coronary arteriolar dilators, has been shown to divert blood from collateral dependent myocardium to normally perfused areas in an animal model (\u201ccoronary steal\u201d). Clinical studies to date evaluating myocardial ischemia, infarction and death as outcome parameters have not established that the coronary arteriolar dilation property of isoflurane is associated with coronary steal or myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. Pharmacokinetics: Isoflurane undergoes minimal biotransformation in man. In the postanesthesia period, only 0.17% of the isoflurane taken up can be recovered as urinary metabolites. Pharmacogenomics : RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes, and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving volatile anesthetic agents, including Isoflurane. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS )."], "manufacturer_name": ["Piramal Critical Care Inc"], "substance_name": ["ISOFLURANE"], "effective_time": "20230216", "product_ndc": ["66794-020"], "brand_name": ["Isoflurane"]}

(1) The bioavailability of tobramycin may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. (2) Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of tobramycin by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the tobramycin regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL. Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of tobramycin by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1,237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7,417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the tobramycin regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1,154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8,085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation. Distribution Following administration of tobramycin inhalation solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible. Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized. Excretion The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following tobramycin administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius . (1) It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death. (3) Tobramycin has in vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . It is bactericidal in vitro at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance Treatment for 6 months with tobramycin in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Susceptibility Test Methods Interpretive criteria for inhaled antibacterial products are not defined. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test methods used for parenteral tobramycin therapy can be used to monitor the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. If decreased susceptibility is noted, the results should be reported to the clinician. Susceptibility breakpoints established for parenteral administration of tobramycin do not apply to aerosolized administration of tobramycin. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin therapy is not clear.

The increase in cyclic AMP is associated with the activation of protein kinase A, which in turn inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in muscle relaxation. Levalbuterol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway. Levalbuterol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges. While it is recognized that beta 2 -adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there are beta-receptors in the human heart, 10% to 50% of which are beta 2 -adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. However, all beta-adrenergic agonist drugs can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Adults and Adolescents \u2265 12 Years Old In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 20 adults with mild-tomoderate asthma received single doses of Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution (0.31 mg, 0.63 mg, and 1.25 mg) and racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution (2.5 mg). All doses of active treatment produced a significantly greater degree of bronchodilation (as measured by percent change from pre-dose mean FEV 1 ) than placebo, and there were no significant differences between any of the active treatment arms. The bronchodilator responses to 1.25 mg of Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution and 2.5 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution were clinically comparable over the 6-hour evaluation period, except for a slightly longer duration of action (>15% increase in FEV 1 from baseline) after administration of 1.25 mg of Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution. Systemic beta-adrenergic adverse effects were observed with all active doses and were generally dose-related for (R)-albuterol. Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution at a dose of 1.25 mg produced a slightly higher rate of systemic beta-adrenergic adverse effects than the 2.5 mg dose of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 12 adults with mild-to-moderate asthma were challenged with inhaled methacholine chloride 20 and 180 minutes following administration of a single dose of 2.5 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate, 1.25 mg of Levalbuterol, 1.25 mg of (S)-albuterol, or placebo using a Pari LC Jet\u2122 nebulizer. Racemic albuterol sulfate, Levalbuterol, and (S)-albuterol had a protective effect against methacholineinduced bronchoconstriction 20 minutes after administration, although the effect of (S)-albuterol was minimal. At 180 minutes after administration, the bronchoprotective effect of 1.25 mg of Levalbuterol was comparable to that of 2.5 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate. At 180 minutes after administration, 1.25 mg of (S)-albuterol had no bronchoprotective effect. In a clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate asthma, comparable efficacy (as measured by change from baseline FEV 1 ) and safety (as measured by heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, serum potassium, and tremor) were demonstrated after a cumulative dose of 5 mg of Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution (four consecutive doses of 1.25 mg administered every 30 minutes) and 10 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution (four consecutive doses of 2.5 mg administered every 30 minutes). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults and Adolescents \u2265 12 Years Old The inhalation pharmacokinetics of Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution were investigated in a randomized cross-over study in 30 healthy adults following administration of a single dose of 1.25 mg and a cumulative dose of 5 mg of Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution and a single dose of 2.5 mg and a cumulative dose of 10 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution by nebulization using a PARI LC Jet\u2122 nebulizer with a Dura-Neb \u00ae 2000 compressor. Following administration of a single 1.25 mg dose of Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution, exposure to (R)-albuterol (AUC of 3.3 ng\u2022hr/mL) was approximately 2-fold higher than following administration of a single 2.5 mg dose of racemic albuterol inhalation solution (AUC of 1.7 ng\u2022hr/mL) (see Table 5). Following administration of a cumulative 5 mg dose of Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution (1.25 mg given every 30 minutes for a total of four doses) or a cumulative 10 mg dose of racemic albuterol inhalation solution (2.5 mg given every 30 minutes for a total of four doses), C max and AUC of (R)-albuterol were comparable (see Table 5).

Children 6-11 Years Old The pharmacokinetic parameters of (R)-and (S)-albuterol in children with asthma were obtained using population pharmacokinetic analysis. These data are presented in Table 6. For comparison, adult data obtained by conventional pharmacokinetic analysis from a different study also are presented in Table 6. In children, AUC and C max of (R)-albuterol following administration of 0.63 mg Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution were comparable to those following administration of 1.25 mg racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution. When the same dose of 0.63 mg of Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution was given to children and adults, the predicted C max of (R)-albuterol in children was similar to that in adults (0.52 vs. 0.56 ng/mL), while predicted AUC in children (2.55 ng\u2022hr/mL) was about 1.5-fold higher than that in adults (1.65 ng\u2022hr/mL). These data support lower doses for children 6-11 years old compared with the adult doses [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ].

When racemic albuterol was administered either intravenously or via inhalation after oral charcoal administration, there was a 3- to 4-fold difference in the area under the concentration-time curves between the (R)-and (S)-albuterol enantiomers, with (S)-albuterol concentrations being consistently higher. However, without charcoal pretreatment, after either oral or inhalation administration the differences were 8- to 24-fold, suggesting that (R)-albuterol is preferentially metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract, presumably by SULT1A3. The primary route of elimination of albuterol enantiomers is through renal excretion (80% to 100%) of either the parent compound or the primary metabolite. Less than 20% of the drug is detected in the feces. Following intravenous administration of racemic albuterol, between 25% and 46% of the (R)-albuterol fraction of the dose was excreted as unchanged (R)-albuterol in the urine. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of racemic albuterol was evaluated in 5 subjects with creatinine clearance of 7 to 53 mL/min, and the results were compared with those from healthy volunteers. Renal disease had no effect on the half-life, but there was a 67% decline in racemic albuterol clearance.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) agent which, based on animal studies, appears to inhibit vagally-mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released at the neuromuscular junctions in the lung. Anticholinergics prevent the increases in intracellular concentration of Ca++ which is caused by interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiovascular effects At recommended dosages, ipratropium bromide does not produce clinically significant changes in pulse rate or blood pressure. Ocular effects In studies without a positive control, ipratropium bromide did not alter pupil size, accommodation, or visual acuity. Mucociliary clearance and respiratory secretions Controlled clinical studies have demonstrated that ipratropium bromide does not alter either mucociliary clearance or the volume or viscosity of respiratory secretions. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following administration by oral inhalation from a metered-dose inhaler, the majority of the delivered dose is deposited in the gastrointestinal tract and, to a lesser extent, in the lung, the intended site of action. Ipratropium bromide is a quaternary amine and hence is not readily absorbed into the systemic circulation either from the surface of the lung or from the gastrointestinal tract as confirmed by blood level and renal excretion studies. The half-life of elimination is about 2 hours after inhalation or intravenous administration. Ipratropium bromide is minimally bound (0% to 9% in vitro ) to plasma albumin and \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. It is partially metabolized to inactive ester hydrolysis products. Following intravenous administration, approximately one-half of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study with 29 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (48-79 years of age) demonstrated that mean peak plasma ipratropium concentrations of 59\u00b120 pg/mL were obtained following a single administration of 4 inhalations of ATROVENT HFA (84 mcg). Plasma ipratropium concentrations declined to 24\u00b115 pg/mL by six hours. When these patients were administered 4 inhalations QID (16 inhalations/day=336 mcg) for one week, the mean peak plasma ipratropium concentration increased to 82\u00b139 pg/mL with a trough (6 hour) concentration of 28\u00b112 pg/mL at steady state. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In the pharmacokinetic study with 29 COPD patients, a subset of 14 patients were >65 years of age. Mean peak plasma ipratropium concentrations of 56\u00b124 pg/mL were obtained following a single administration of 4 inhalations (21 mcg/puff) of ATROVENT HFA (84 mcg). When these 14 patients were administered 4 inhalations four times a day (16 inhalations/day) for one week, the mean peak plasma ipratropium concentration only increased to 84\u00b150 pg/mL indicating that the pharmacokinetic behavior of ipratropium bromide in the geriatric population is consistent with younger patients.

Albuterol sulfate has the chemical name \u03b1 1 -[( tert -butylamino) methyl]-4-hydroxy- m -xylene-\u03b1,\u03b1\u2019-diol sulfate (2:1)(salt), and has the following chemical structure: The molecular weight of albuterol sulfate is 576.7, and the empirical formula is (C 13 H 21 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022H 2 SO 4 . Albuterol sulfate is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. Albuterol sulfate is the official generic name in the United States, and salbutamol sulfate is the World Health Organization recommended generic name. Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol is a pressurized metered-dose aerosol unit with a dose counter. Albuterol Sulfate is for oral inhalation only. It contains a microcrystalline suspension of albuterol sulfate in propellant HFA-134a (1, 1, 1, 2-tetrafluoroethane) and ethanol. Prime the inhaler before using for the first time and in cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 2 weeks by releasing three sprays into the air, away from the face. After priming, each actuation delivers 108 mcg albuterol sulfate, from the actuator mouthpiece (equivalent to 90 mcg of albuterol base). Each canister provides 200 actuations (inhalations). This product does not contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as the propellant. structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Albuterol sulfate is a beta 2 -adrenergic agonist. The pharmacologic effects of albuterol sulfate are attributable to activation of beta 2 -adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle. Activation of beta 2 -adrenergic receptors leads to the activation of adenylcyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3\u2019, 5\u2019-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). This increase of cyclic AMP is associated with the activation of protein kinase A, which in turn inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in muscle relaxation. Albuterol relaxes the smooth muscle of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles. Albuterol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway. While it is recognized that beta 2 -adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there are beta-receptors in the human heart, 10% to 50% of which are cardiac beta 2 -adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects. However, inhaled albuterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] . 12.2 Pharmacokinetics The systemic levels of albuterol are low after inhalation of recommended doses. In a crossover study conducted in healthy male and female volunteers, high cumulative doses of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol (1,080 mcg of albuterol base administered over one hour) yielded mean peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and systemic exposure (AUC inf ) of approximately 4,100 pg/mL and 28,426 pg/mL*hr, respectively compared to approximately 3,900 pg/mL and 28,395 pg/mL*hr, respectively following the same dose of an active HFA-134a albuterol inhaler comparator. The terminal plasma half-life of albuterol delivered by Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol was approximately 6 hours. Comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters demonstrated no differences between the products. The pharmacokinetic profile of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol was evaluated in a two-way cross-over study in 11 healthy pediatric volunteers, 4 to 11 years of age. A single dose administration of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol (180 mcg albuterol base) yielded a least square mean (SE) C max and AUC 0-\u221e of 1,100 (1.18) pg/mL and 5,120 (1.15) pg/mL*hr, respectively. The least square mean (SE) terminal plasma half-life of albuterol delivered by Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol was 166 (7.8) minutes. Metabolism and Elimination: Information available in the published literature suggests that the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of albuterol in humans is SULTIA3 (sulfotransferase). When racemic albuterol was administered either intravenously or via inhalation after oral charcoal administration, there was a 3- to 4-fold difference in the area under the concentration-time curves between the (R)- and (S)-albuterol enantiomers, with (S)-albuterol concentrations being consistently higher. However, without charcoal pretreatment, after either oral or inhalation administration the differences were 8- to 24-fold, suggesting that the (R)-albuterol is preferentially metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract, presumably by SULTIA3. The primary route of elimination of albuterol is through renal excretion (80% to 100%) of either the parent compound or the primary metabolite. Less than 20% of the drug is detected in the feces. Following intravenous administration of racemic albuterol, between 25% and 46% of the (R) albuterol fraction of the dose was excreted as unchanged (R)-albuterol in the urine. Geriatric, Pediatric, Hepatic/Renal Impairment: No pharmacokinetic studies for Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol have been conducted in neonates or elderly subjects. The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol has not been evaluated. The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of albuterol was evaluated in 5 subjects with creatinine clearance of 7 to 53 mL/min, and the results were compared with those from healthy volunteers. Renal disease had no effect on the half-life, but there was a 67% decline in albuterol clearance.

One active component of ADVAIR DISKUS is fluticasone propionate, a corticosteroid having the chemical name S- (fluoromethyl) 6\u03b1,9-difluoro-11\u03b2,17-dihydroxy-16\u03b1-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-17\u03b2-carbothioate, 17-propionate and the following chemical structure: Fluticasone propionate is a white powder with a molecular weight of 500.6, and the empirical formula is C 25 H 31 F 3 O 5 S. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide, and slightly soluble in methanol and 95% ethanol. The other active component of ADVAIR DISKUS is salmeterol xinafoate, a beta 2 -adrenergic bronchodilator. Salmeterol xinafoate is the racemic form of the 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid salt of salmeterol. It has the chemical name 4-hydroxy-\u03b1 1 -[[[6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexyl]amino]methyl]-1,3-benzenedimethanol, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthalenecarboxylate and the following chemical structure: Salmeterol xinafoate is a white powder with a molecular weight of 603.8, and the empirical formula is C 25 H 37 NO 4 \u2022C 11 H 8 O 3 . It is freely soluble in methanol; slightly soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and isopropanol; and sparingly soluble in water. ADVAIR DISKUS is a purple plastic inhaler containing a foil blister strip. Each blister on the strip contains a white powder mix of micronized fluticasone propionate (100, 250, or 500 mcg) and micronized salmeterol xinafoate salt (72.5 mcg, equivalent to 50 mcg of salmeterol base) in 12.5 mg of formulation containing lactose monohydrate (which contains milk proteins). After the inhaler is activated, the powder is dispersed into the airstream created by the patient inhaling through the mouthpiece. Under standardized in vitro test conditions, ADVAIR DISKUS delivers 93, 233, and 465 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 45 mcg of salmeterol base per blister from ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50, ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50, and ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50, respectively, when tested at a flow rate of 60 L/min for 2 seconds. In adult subjects with obstructive lung disease and severely compromised lung function (mean FEV 1 20% to 30% of predicted), mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the DISKUS inhaler was 82.4 L/min (range: 46.1 to 115.3 L/min). Inhalation profiles for adolescent (N = 13, aged 12 to 17 years) and adult (N = 17, aged 18 to 50 years) subjects with asthma inhaling maximally through the DISKUS inhaler show mean PIF of 122.2 L/min (range: 81.6 to 152.1 L/min). Inhalation profiles for pediatric subjects with asthma inhaling maximally through the DISKUS inhaler show a mean PIF of 75.5 L/min (range: 49.0 to 104.8 L/min) for the 4-year-old subject set (N = 20) and 107.3 L/min (range: 82.8 to 125.6 L/min) for the 8-year-old subject set (N = 20). The actual amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors, such as inspiratory flow profile. Fluticasone propionate chemical structure Salmeterol xinafoate chemical structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action ADVAIR DISKUS ADVAIR DISKUS contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol. The mechanisms of action described below for the individual components apply to ADVAIR DISKUS. These drugs represent 2 different classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a LABA) that have different effects on clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory indices. Fluticasone Propionate Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Inflammation is also a component in the pathogenesis of COPD. In contrast to asthma, however, the predominant inflammatory cells in COPD include neutrophils, CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and macrophages. The effects of corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD are not well defined and ICS and fluticasone propionate when used apart from ADVAIR DISKUS are not indicated for the treatment of COPD. Salmeterol Xinafoate Salmeterol is a selective LABA. In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta 2 -adrenoceptors than albuterol. Although beta 2 -adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta 1 -adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta 2 -adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta 2 -agonists may have cardiac effects. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including salmeterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3\u2032,5\u2032-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. In vitro tests show that salmeterol is a potent and long-lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D 2 , from human lung. Salmeterol inhibits histamine-induced plasma protein extravasation and inhibits platelet-activating factor-induced eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of guinea pigs when administered by the inhaled route. In humans, single doses of salmeterol administered via inhalation aerosol attenuate allergen-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics ADVAIR DISKUS Healthy Subjects: Cardiovascular Effects: Since systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol are not normally seen at the therapeutic dose, higher doses were used to produce measurable effects. Four (4) trials were conducted with healthy adult subjects: (1) a single-dose crossover trial using 2 inhalations of ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg and salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg given concurrently, or fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg given alone, (2) a cumulative-dose trial using 50 to 400 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder given alone or as ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50, (3) a repeat-dose trial for 11 days using 2 inhalations twice daily of ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg, or salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg, and (4) a single-dose trial using 5 inhalations of ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg alone, or placebo. In these trials no significant differences were observed in the pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol (pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, potassium, and glucose) whether the salmeterol was given as ADVAIR DISKUS, concurrently with fluticasone propionate from separate inhalers, or as salmeterol alone. The systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol were not altered by the presence of fluticasone propionate in ADVAIR DISKUS. The potential effect of salmeterol on the effects of fluticasone propionate on the HPA axis was also evaluated in these trials. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: No significant differences across treatments were observed in 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion and, where measured, 24-hour plasma cortisol AUC. The systemic pharmacodynamic effects of fluticasone propionate were not altered by the presence of salmeterol in ADVAIR DISKUS in healthy subjects. Subjects with Asthma: Adult and Adolescent Subjects: Cardiovascular Effects: In clinical trials with ADVAIR DISKUS in adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older with asthma, no significant differences were observed in the systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol (pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, potassium, and glucose) whether the salmeterol was given alone or as ADVAIR DISKUS. In 72 adult and adolescent subjects with asthma given either ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 or ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50, continuous 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring was performed after the first dose and after 12 weeks of therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: In a 28-week trial in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma, ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 twice daily was compared with the concurrent use of salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg plus fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg from separate inhalers or fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg alone. No significant differences across treatments were observed in serum cortisol AUC after 12 weeks of dosing or in 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion after 12 and 28 weeks. In a 12-week trial in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma, ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 twice daily was compared with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg alone, salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg alone, and placebo. For most subjects, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by 30-minute cosyntropin stimulation, remained intact with ADVAIR DISKUS. One subject (3%) who received ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 had an abnormal response (peak serum cortisol <18 mcg/dL) after dosing, compared with 2 subjects (6%) who received placebo, 2 subjects (6%) who received fluticasone propionate 250 mcg, and no subjects who received salmeterol. In a repeat-dose, 3-way crossover trial, 1 inhalation twice daily of ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50, FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg (fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg), or placebo was administered to 20 adult and adolescent subjects with asthma. After 28 days of treatment, geometric mean serum cortisol AUC over 12 hours showed no significant difference between ADVAIR DISKUS and FLOVENT DISKUS or between either active treatment and placebo. Pediatric Subjects: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: In a 12-week trial in subjects with asthma aged 4 to 11 years who were receiving ICS at trial entry, ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 twice daily was compared with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg administered twice daily via the DISKUS. The values for 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion at trial entry and after 12 weeks of treatment were similar within each treatment group. After 12 weeks, 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion was also similar between the 2 groups. Subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Cardiovascular Effects: In clinical trials with ADVAIR DISKUS in subjects with COPD, no significant differences were seen in pulse rate, blood pressure, potassium, and glucose between ADVAIR DISKUS, the individual components of ADVAIR DISKUS, and placebo. In a trial of ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50, 8 subjects (2 [1.1%] in the group given ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50, 1 [0.5%] in the fluticasone propionate 250-mcg group, 3 [1.7%] in the salmeterol group, and 2 [1.1%] in the placebo group) had QTc intervals >470 msec at least 1 time during the treatment period. Five (5) of these 8 subjects had a prolonged QTc interval at baseline. In a 24-week trial, 130 subjects with COPD received continuous 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring prior to the first dose and after 4 weeks of twice-daily treatment with either ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg, salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg, or placebo. No significant differences in ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias and heart rate were observed among the groups treated with ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50, the individual components, or placebo. One (1) subject in the fluticasone propionate group experienced atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation, and 1 subject in the group given ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 experienced heart block. There were 3 cases of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (1 each in the placebo, salmeterol, and fluticasone propionate 500-mcg treatment groups). In 24-week clinical trials in subjects with COPD, the incidence of clinically significant ECG abnormalities (myocardial ischemia, ventricular hypertrophy, clinically significant conduction abnormalities, clinically significant arrhythmias) was lower for subjects who received salmeterol (1%, 9 of 688 subjects who received either salmeterol 50 mcg or ADVAIR DISKUS) compared with placebo (3%, 10 of 370 subjects). No significant differences with salmeterol 50 mcg alone or in combination with fluticasone propionate as ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 were observed on pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a subset of subjects with COPD who underwent 12-hour serial vital sign measurements after the first dose (n = 183) and after 12 weeks of therapy (n = 149). Median changes from baseline in pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were similar to those seen with placebo. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: Short-cosyntropin stimulation testing was performed both at Day 1 and Endpoint in 101 subjects with COPD receiving twice-daily ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg, salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg, or placebo. For most subjects, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by short cosyntropin stimulation, remained intact with ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50. One (1) subject (3%) who received ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 had an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol <14.5 mcg/dL assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography) after dosing, compared with 2 subjects (9%) who received fluticasone propionate 250 mcg, 2 subjects (7%) who received salmeterol 50 mcg, and 1 subject (4%) who received placebo following 24 weeks of treatment or early discontinuation from trial. After 36 weeks of dosing, serum cortisol concentrations in a subset of subjects with COPD (n = 83) were 22% lower in subjects receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 and 21% lower in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate 500 mcg than in subjects receiving placebo. Other Fluticasone Propionate Products Subjects with Asthma: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using dosages up to and including 250 mcg twice daily, occasional abnormal short cosyntropin tests (peak serum cortisol <18 mcg/dL assessed by radioimmunoassay) were noted both in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and in subjects receiving placebo. The incidence of abnormal tests at 500 mcg twice daily was greater than placebo. In a 2-year trial carried out with the DISKHALER inhalation device in 64 subjects with mild, persistent asthma (mean FEV 1 91% of predicted) randomized to fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily or placebo, no subject receiving fluticasone propionate had an abnormal response to 6-hour cosyntropin infusion (peak serum cortisol <18 mcg/dL). With a peak cortisol threshold of <35 mcg/dL, 1 subject receiving fluticasone propionate (4%) had an abnormal response at 1 year; repeat testing at 18 months and 2 years was normal. Another subject receiving fluticasone propionate (5%) had an abnormal response at 2 years. No subject on placebo had an abnormal response at 1 or 2 years. Subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects: After 4 weeks of dosing, the steady-state fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics and serum cortisol levels were described in a subset of subjects with COPD (n = 86) randomized to twice-daily fluticasone propionate inhalation powder via the DISKUS 500 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg, or placebo. Serial serum cortisol concentrations were measured across a 12-hour dosing interval. Serum cortisol concentrations following 250- and 500-mcg twice-daily dosing were 10% and 21% lower than placebo, respectively, indicating a dose-dependent increase in systemic exposure to fluticasone propionate. Other Salmeterol Xinafoate Products Subjects with Asthma: Cardiovascular Effects: Inhaled salmeterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce dose-related cardiovascular effects and effects on blood glucose and/or serum potassium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 , 5.18 )] . The cardiovascular effects (heart rate, blood pressure) associated with salmeterol inhalation aerosol occur with similar frequency, and are of similar type and severity, as those noted following albuterol administration. The effects of rising inhaled doses of salmeterol and standard inhaled doses of albuterol were studied in volunteers and in subjects with asthma. Salmeterol doses up to 84 mcg administered as inhalation aerosol resulted in heart rate increases of 3 to 16 beats/min, about the same as albuterol dosed at 180 mcg by inhalation aerosol (4 to 10 beats/min). Adult and adolescent subjects receiving 50-mcg doses of salmeterol inhalation powder (N = 60) underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during two 12-hour periods after the first dose and after 1 month of therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted. Concomitant Use of ADVAIR DISKUS with Other Respiratory Medicines Short-acting Beta 2 -agonists: In clinical trials in subjects with asthma, the mean daily need for albuterol by 166 adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older using ADVAIR DISKUS was approximately 1.3 inhalations/day and ranged from 0 to 9 inhalations/day. Five percent (5%) of subjects using ADVAIR DISKUS in these trials averaged 6 or more inhalations per day over the course of the 12-week trials. No increase in frequency of cardiovascular adverse events was observed among subjects who averaged 6 or more inhalations per day. In a clinical trial in subjects with COPD, the mean daily need for albuterol for subjects using ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 was 4.1 inhalations/day. Twenty-six percent (26%) of subjects using ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 averaged 6 or more inhalations of albuterol per day over the course of the 24-week trial. No increase in frequency of cardiovascular adverse reactions was observed among subjects who averaged 6 or more inhalations per day. Methylxanthines: The concurrent use of intravenously or orally administered methylxanthines (e.g., aminophylline, theophylline) by adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older receiving ADVAIR DISKUS has not been completely evaluated. In clinical trials in subjects with asthma, 39 subjects receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50, ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50, or ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 twice daily concurrently with a theophylline product had adverse event rates similar to those in 304 subjects receiving ADVAIR DISKUS without theophylline. Similar results were observed in subjects receiving salmeterol 50 mcg plus fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily concurrently with a theophylline product (n = 39) or without theophylline (n = 132). In a clinical trial in subjects with COPD, 17 subjects receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 twice daily concurrently with a theophylline product had adverse event rates similar to those in 161 subjects receiving ADVAIR DISKUS without theophylline. Based on the available data, the concomitant administration of methylxanthines with ADVAIR DISKUS did not alter the observed adverse event profile. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray: In adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older receiving ADVAIR DISKUS in clinical trials, no difference in the profile of adverse events or HPA axis effects was noted between subjects who were receiving FLONASE (fluticasone propionate) Nasal Spray, 50 mcg concurrently (n = 46) and those who were not (n = 130). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluticasone Propionate: Healthy Subjects: Fluticasone propionate acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate is negligible (<1%), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. In contrast, the majority of the fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung is systemically absorbed. Following administration of ADVAIR DISKUS to healthy adult subjects, peak plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate were achieved in 1 to 2 hours. In a single-dose crossover trial, a higher-than-recommended dose of ADVAIR DISKUS was administered to 14 healthy adult subjects. Two (2) inhalations of the following treatments were administered: ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg and salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg given concurrently, and fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg alone. Mean peak plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate averaged 107, 94, and 120 pg/mL, respectively, indicating no significant changes in systemic exposures of fluticasone propionate. In 15 healthy subjects, systemic exposure to fluticasone propionate from 4 inhalations of ADVAIR HFA 230/21 (fluticasone propionate 230 mcg and salmeterol 21 mcg) Inhalation Aerosol (920/84 mcg) and 2 inhalations of ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 (1,000/100 mcg) was similar between the 2 inhalers (i.e., 799 versus 832 pg\u2022h/mL, respectively), but approximately half the systemic exposure from 4 inhalations of fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol 220 mcg (880 mcg, AUC = 1,543 pg\u2022h/mL). Similar results were observed for peak fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations (186 and 182 pg/mL from ADVAIR HFA and ADVAIR DISKUS, respectively, and 307 pg/mL from the fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol). Absolute bioavailability of fluticasone propionate was 5.3% and 5.5% following administration of ADVAIR HFA and ADVAIR DISKUS, respectively. Subjects with Asthma and COPD: Peak steady-state fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations in adult subjects with asthma (N = 11) ranged from undetectable to 266 pg/mL after a 500-mcg twice-daily dose of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using the DISKUS inhaler. The mean fluticasone propionate plasma concentration was 110 pg/mL. Full pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained from 9 female and 16 male subjects with asthma given fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg twice daily using the DISKUS inhaler and from 14 female and 43 male subjects with COPD given 250 or 500 mcg twice daily. No overall differences in fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics were observed. Peak steady-state fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations in subjects with COPD averaged 53 pg/mL (range: 19.3 to 159.3 pg/mL) after treatment with 250 mcg twice daily (n = 30) and 84 pg/mL (range: 24.3 to 197.1 pg/mL) after treatment with 500 mcg twice daily (n = 27) via the fluticasone propionate DISKUS inhaler. In another trial in subjects with COPD, peak steady-state fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations averaged 115 pg/mL (range: 52.6 to 366.0 pg/mL) after treatment with 500 mcg twice daily via the fluticasone propionate DISKUS inhaler (n = 15) and 105 pg/mL (range: 22.5 to 299.0 pg/mL) via ADVAIR DISKUS (n = 24). Salmeterol Xinafoate: Healthy Subjects: Salmeterol xinafoate, an ionic salt, dissociates in solution so that the salmeterol and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (xinafoate) moieties are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated independently. Salmeterol acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Following administration of ADVAIR DISKUS to healthy adult subjects, peak plasma concentrations of salmeterol were achieved in about 5 minutes. In 15 healthy subjects receiving ADVAIR HFA 230/21 Inhalation Aerosol (920/84 mcg) and ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 (1,000/100 mcg), systemic exposure to salmeterol was higher (317 versus 169 pg\u2022h/mL) and peak salmeterol concentrations were lower (196 versus 223 pg/mL) following ADVAIR HFA compared with ADVAIR DISKUS, although pharmacodynamic results were comparable. Subjects with Asthma: Because of the small therapeutic dose, systemic levels of salmeterol are low or undetectable after inhalation of recommended dosages (50 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder twice daily). Following chronic administration of an inhaled dose of 50 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder twice daily, salmeterol was detected in plasma within 5 to 45 minutes in 7 subjects with asthma; plasma concentrations were very low, with mean peak concentrations of 167 pg/mL at 20 minutes and no accumulation with repeated doses. Distribution Fluticasone Propionate: Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averages 99%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Salmeterol: The percentage of salmeterol bound to human plasma proteins averages 96% in vitro over the concentration range of 8 to 7,722 ng of salmeterol base per milliliter, much higher concentrations than those achieved following therapeutic doses of salmeterol. Metabolism Fluticasone Propionate: The total clearance of fluticasone propionate is high (average, 1,093 mL/min), with renal clearance accounting for <0.02% of the total. The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Salmeterol: Salmeterol base is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation, with subsequent elimination predominantly in the feces. No significant amount of unchanged salmeterol base was detected in either urine or feces. An in vitro study using human liver microsomes showed that salmeterol is extensively metabolized to \u03b1-hydroxysalmeterol (aliphatic oxidation) by CYP3A4. Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, essentially completely inhibited the formation of \u03b1-hydroxysalmeterol in vitro. Elimination Fluticasone Propionate: Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Terminal half-life estimates of fluticasone propionate for ADVAIR HFA, ADVAIR DISKUS, and fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol were similar and averaged 5.6 hours. Salmeterol: In 2 healthy adult subjects who received 1 mg of radiolabeled salmeterol (as salmeterol xinafoate) orally, approximately 25% and 60% of the radiolabeled salmeterol was eliminated in urine and feces, respectively, over a period of 7 days. The terminal elimination half-life was about 5.5 hours (1 volunteer only). The xinafoate moiety has no apparent pharmacologic activity. The xinafoate moiety is highly protein bound (>99%) and has a long elimination half-life of 11 days. No terminal half-life estimates were calculated for salmeterol following administration of ADVAIR DISKUS. Specific Populations A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol utilizing data from 9 controlled clinical trials that included 350 subjects with asthma aged 4 to 77 years who received treatment with ADVAIR DISKUS, the combination of HFA-propelled fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation aerosol (ADVAIR HFA), fluticasone propionate inhalation powder (FLOVENT DISKUS), HFA-propelled fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol (FLOVENT HFA), or CFC-propelled fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. The population pharmacokinetic analyses for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol showed no clinically relevant effects of age, gender, race, body weight, body mass index, or percent of predicted FEV 1 on apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution. Age: When the population pharmacokinetic analysis for fluticasone propionate was divided into subgroups based on fluticasone propionate strength, formulation, and age (adolescents/adults and children), there were some differences in fluticasone propionate exposure. Higher fluticasone propionate exposure from ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 compared with FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg was observed in adolescents and adults (ratio 1.52 [90% CI: 1.08, 2.13]). However, in clinical trials of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration comparing ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 and FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg in adolescents and adults, no differences in systemic effects of corticosteroid treatment (e.g., HPA axis effects) were observed. Similar fluticasone propionate exposure was observed from ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 and FLOVENT DISKUS 500 mcg (ratio 0.83 [90% CI: 0.65, 1.07]) in adolescents and adults. Steady-state systemic exposure to salmeterol when delivered as ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50, ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50, or ADVAIR HFA 115/21 (fluticasone propionate 115 mcg and salmeterol 21 mcg) Inhalation Aerosol was evaluated in 127 subjects aged 4 to 57 years. The geometric mean AUC was 325 pg\u2022h/mL (90% CI: 309, 341) in adolescents and adults. The population pharmacokinetic analysis included 160 subjects with asthma aged 4 to 11 years who received ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 or FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg. Higher fluticasone propionate exposure (AUC) was observed in children from ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 compared with FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg (ratio 1.20 [90% CI: 1.06, 1.37]). Higher fluticasone propionate exposure (AUC) from ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 was observed in children compared with adolescents and adults (ratio 1.63 [90% CI: 1.35, 1.96]). However, in clinical trials of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration comparing ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 and FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg in both adolescents and adults and in children, no differences in systemic effects of corticosteroid treatment (e.g., HPA axis effects) were observed. Exposure to salmeterol was higher in children compared with adolescents and adults who received ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 (ratio 1.23 [90% CI: 1.10, 1.38]). However, in clinical trials of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration with ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 in both adolescents and adults and in children, no differences in systemic effects of beta 2 -agonist treatment (e.g., cardiovascular effects, tremor) were observed. Male and Female Patients: The population pharmacokinetic analysis involved 202 males and 148 females with asthma who received fluticasone propionate alone or in combination with salmeterol and showed no gender differences for fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. The population pharmacokinetic analysis involved 76 males and 51 females with asthma who received salmeterol in combination with fluticasone propionate and showed no gender differences for salmeterol pharmacokinetics. Patients with Hepatic and Renal Impairment: Formal pharmacokinetic studies using ADVAIR DISKUS have not been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, since both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol are predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. Drug Interaction Studies In the repeat- and single-dose trials, there was no evidence of significant drug interaction in systemic exposure between fluticasone propionate and salmeterol when given alone or in combination via the DISKUS. The population pharmacokinetic analysis from 9 controlled clinical trials in 350 subjects with asthma showed no significant effects on fluticasone propionate or salmeterol pharmacokinetics following co-administration with beta 2 -agonists, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or theophyllines. Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4: Ritonavir: Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range: 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC (0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022h/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC (0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range: 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022h/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in serum cortisol AUC. Ketoconazole: Fluticasone Propionate: In a placebo-controlled crossover trial in 8 healthy adult volunteers, coadministration of a single dose of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) with multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg) to steady state resulted in increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, a reduction in plasma cortisol AUC, and no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. Salmeterol: In a placebo-controlled, crossover drug interaction trial in 20 healthy male and female subjects, coadministration of salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure as determined by a 16-fold increase in AUC (ratio with and without ketoconazole 15.76 [90% CI: 10.66, 23.31]) mainly due to increased bioavailability of the swallowed portion of the dose. Peak plasma salmeterol concentrations were increased by 1.4-fold (90% CI: 1.23, 1.68). Three (3) out of 20 subjects (15%) were withdrawn from salmeterol and ketoconazole coadministration due to beta-agonist\u2013mediated systemic effects (2 with QTc prolongation and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole did not result in a clinically significant effect on mean heart rate, mean blood potassium, or mean blood glucose. Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration. Erythromycin: Fluticasone Propionate: In a multiple-dose drug interaction trial, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg 3 times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. Salmeterol: In a repeat-dose trial in 13 healthy subjects, concomitant administration of erythromycin (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) and salmeterol inhalation aerosol resulted in a 40% increase in salmeterol C max at steady state (ratio with and without erythromycin 1.4 [90% CI: 0.96, 2.03], P = 0.12), a 3.6-beat/min increase in heart rate ([95% CI: 0.19, 7.03], P <0.04), a 5.8-msec increase in QTc interval ([95% CI: -6.14, 17.77], P = 0.34), and no change in plasma potassium."], "manufacturer_name": ["A-S Medication Solutions"], "substance_name": ["FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE", "SALMETEROL XINAFOATE"], "effective_time": "20240227", "product_ndc": ["50090-4505"], "brand_name": ["ADVAIR DISKUS"]}

Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic bronchodilator chemically described as 8-azoniabicyclo [3.2.1]-octane, 3-(3-hydroxy-1-oxo-2-phenylpropoxy)-8methyl-8-(1-methylethyl)-, bromide, monohydrate ( endo,syn )-, (\u00b1)-; a synthetic quaternary ammonium compound, chemically related to atropine. It has a molecular weight of 430.4 and the empirical formula is C 20 H 30 BrNO 3 \u2022H 2 O. It is a white crystalline substance, freely soluble in water and lower alcohols, and insoluble in lipophilic solvents such as ether, chloroform, and fluorocarbons. Figure 3.1-2. Chemical structure of ipratropium bromide. Each 3 mL Sterile Unit-dose Vial contains 0.5 mg of ipratropium bromide (0.017%) and 3 mg Equivalent to 2.5 mg albuterol base albuterol sulfate (0.083%) in an isotonic, sterile, aqueous solution containing sodium chloride and 1 N hydrochloric acid to adjust to pH 4. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is a clear, colorless solution. It does not require dilution prior to administration by nebulization. For Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, like all other nebulized treatments, the amount delivered to the lungs will depend on patient factors, the jet nebulizer utilized, and compressor performance. Using the Pari-LC-Plus\u2122 nebulizer (with face mask or mouthpiece) connected to a PRONEB\u2122 compressor system, under in vitro conditions, the mean delivered dose from the mouth piece (% nominal dose) was approximately 46% of albuterol and 42% of ipratropium bromide at a mean flow rate of 3.6 L/min. The mean nebulization time was 15 minutes or less. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should be administered from jet nebulizers at adequate flow rates, via face masks or mouthpieces (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Chemical Structure Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is a combination of the \u03b2 2 -adrenergic bronchodilator, albuterol sulfate, and the anticholinergic bronchodilator, ipratropium bromide. Albuterol sulfate Mechanism of Action The prime action of \u03b2-adrenergic drugs is to stimulate adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The cAMP thus formed mediates the cellular responses. In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, recent data indicated that 10% to 50% of the \u03b2-receptors in the human heart may be \u03b2 2 -receptors. The precise function of these receptors, however, is not yet established. Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects. Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other \u03b2-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients. Pharmacokinetics Albuterol sulfate is longer acting than isoproterenol in most patients by any route of administration, because it is not a substrate for the cellular uptake processes for catecholamine nor for the metabolism of catechol-O-methyl transferase. Instead the drug is conjugatively metabolized to albuterol 4'- O -sulfate. Animal Pharmacology/Toxicology Intravenous studies in rats with albuterol sulfate have demonstrated that albuterol crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches brain concentrations amounting to approximately 5% of plasma concentrations. In structures outside of the blood-brain barrier (pineal and pituitary glands), albuterol concentrations were found to be 100 times those found in whole brain. Studies in laboratory animals (minipigs, rodents, and dogs) have demonstrated the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death (with histological evidence of myocardial necrosis) when beta-agonists and methyl-xanthines are administered concurrently. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Ipratropium bromide Mechanism of Action Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) agent, which blocks the muscarinic receptors of acetylcholine, and, based on animal studies, appears to inhibit vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released from the vagus nerve. Anticholinergics prevent the increases in intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), resulting from the interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptors of bronchial smooth muscle. Pharmacokinetics The bronchodilation following inhalation of ipratropium is primarily a local, site-specific effect, not a systemic one. Much of an inhaled dose is swallowed as shown by fecal excretion studies. Following nebulization of a 1-mg dose to healthy volunteers, a mean of 4% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. Ipratropium bromide is minimally (0% to 9% in vitro ) bound to plasma albumin and \u03b1 1 -acid glycoproteins. It is partially metabolized to inactive ester hydrolysis products. Following intravenous administration, approximately one-half is excreted unchanged in the urine. The half-life of elimination is about 1.6 hours after intravenous administration. Ipratropium bromide that reaches the systemic circulation is reportedly removed by the kidneys rapidly at a rate that exceeds the glomerular filtration rate. The pharmacokinetics of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution or ipratropium bromide have not been studied in the elderly and in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS ). Animal Pharmacology/Toxicology Autoradiographic studies in rats have shown that ipratropium does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution Mechanism of Action Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is expected to maximize the response to treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by reducing bronchospasm through two distinctly different mechanisms: sympathomimetic (albuterol sulfate) and anticholinergic/parasympatholytic (ipratropium bromide). Simultaneous administration of both an anticholinergic and a \u03b2 2 -sympathomimetic is designed to produce greater bronchodilation effects than when either drug is utilized alone at its recommended dosage. Animal Pharmacology/Toxicology In 30-day studies in Sprague-Dawley rats and Beagle dogs, subcutaneous doses of up to 205.5 mcg/kg of ipratropium administered with up to 1000 mcg/kg albuterol in rats and 3.16 mcg/kg ipratropium and 15 mcg/kg albuterol in dogs (less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m 2 basis) did not cause death or potentiation of the cardiotoxicity induced by albuterol administered alone. Pharmacokinetics In a double blind, double period, crossover study, 15 male and female subjects were administered single doses of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution or albuterol sulfate inhalation solution at two times the recommended single doses as two inhalations separated by 15 minutes. The total nebulized dose of albuterol sulfate from both treatments was 6 mg and the total dose of ipratropium bromide from Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution was 1 mg. Peak albuterol plasma concentrations occurred at 0.8 hours after dosing for both treatments. The mean peak albuterol concentration following administration of albuterol sulfate alone was 4.86 (\u00b1 2.65) mg/mL and it was 4.65 (\u00b1 2.92) mg/mL for Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution. Mean AUC values for the two treatments were 26.6 (\u00b1 15.2) ng\u2219hr/mL (albuterol sulfate alone) versus 24.2 (\u00b1 14.5) ng\u2219hr/mL (Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution). The mean t 1/2 values were 7.2 (\u00b1 1.3) hours (albuterol sulfate alone) and 6.7 (\u00b1 1.7) hours (Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution). A mean of 8.4 (\u00b1 8.9)% of the albuterol dose was excreted unchanged in urine following administration of two vials of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution which is similar to 8.8 (\u00b1 7.3)% that was obtained from albuterol sulfate inhalation solution. There were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of albuterol between the two treatments. For ipratropium, a mean of 3.9 (\u00b1 5.1)% of the ipratropium bromide dose was excreted unchanged in urine following two vials of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, which is comparable with previously reported data. Clinical Trials In a 12 week, randomized, double-blind, positive-control, crossover study of albuterol sulfate, ipratropium bromide, and Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, 863 COPD patients were evaluated for bronchodilator efficacy comparing ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate with albuterol sulfate and ipratropium bromide alone. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution demonstrated significantly better changes in FEV 1 , as measured from baseline to peak response, when compared with either albuterol sulfate or ipratropium bromide. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution was also shown to have the rapid onset associated with albuterol sulfate, with a mean time to peak FEV 1 of 1.5 hours, and the extended duration associated with ipratropium bromide with a duration of 15% response in FEV 1 of 4.3 hours. Figure 3. 1-3. Mean Change in FEV 1 - Measured on Day 14 This study demonstrated that each component of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution contributed to the improvement in pulmonary function, especially during the first 4 to 5 hours after dosing, and that Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution was significantly more effective than albuterol sulfate or ipratropium bromide alone.

Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes. Albuterol is longer acting than isoproterenol in most patients by any route of administration because it is not a substrate for the cellular uptake processes for catecholamines nor for catechol-O-methyl transferase. Studies in asthmatic patients have shown that less than 20% of a single albuterol dose was absorbed following IPPB (intermittent positive-pressure breathing) or nebulizer administration; the remaining amount was recovered from the nebulizer and apparatus and expired air. Most of the absorbed dose was recovered in the urine 24 hours after drug administration. Following a 3 mg dose of nebulized albuterol, the maximum albuterol plasma level at 0.5 hour was 2.1 ng/mL (range 1.4 to 3.2 ng/mL). There was a significant dose-related response in FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) and peak flow rate. It has been demonstrated that following oral administration of 4 mg albuterol, the elimination half-life was five to six hours. Animal studies show that albuterol does not pass the blood-brain barrier. Recent studies in laboratory animals (minipigs, rodents, and dogs) recorded the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death (with histologic evidence of myocardial necrosis) when beta-agonists and methylxanthines were administered concurrently. The significance of these findings when applied to humans is currently unknown. In controlled clinical trials, most patients exhibited an onset of improvement in pulmonary function within 5 minutes as determined by FEV 1 . FEV 1 measurements also showed that the maximum average improvement in pulmonary function usually occurred at approximately 1 hour following inhalation of 2.5 mg of albuterol by compressor-nebulizer, and remained close to peak for 2 hours. Clinically significant improvement in pulmonary function (defined as maintenance of a 15% or more increase in FEV 1 over baseline values) continued for 3 to 4 hours in most patients and in some patients continued up to 6 hours. In repetitive dose studies, continued effectiveness was demonstrated throughout the three-month period of treatment in some patients. Published reports of trials in asthmatic children aged 3 years or older have demonstrated significant improvement in either FEV 1 or PEFR within 2 to 20 minutes following single dose of albuterol inhalation solution. An increase of 15% or more in baseline FEV 1 has been observed in children aged 5 to 11 years up to 6 hours after treatment with doses of 0.10 mg/kg or higher of albuterol inhalation solution.
