Chemical Structure Chemical Structure Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mepivacaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane and prevents the initiation and transmission of nerve impulses, thereby effecting local anesthesia. Mepivacaine is rapidly metabolized, with only a small percentage of the anesthetic (5 to 10 percent) being excreted unchanged in the urine. Mepivacaine because of its amide structure, is not detoxified by the circulating plasma esterases. The liver is the principal site of metabolism, with over 50 percent of the administered dose being excreted into the bile as metabolites. Most of the metabolized Mepivacaine is probably resorbed in the intestine and then excreted into the urine since only a small percentage is found in the feces. The principal route of excretion is via the kidney. Most of the anesthetic and its metabolites are eliminated within 30 hours. It has been shown that hydroxylation and N-demethylation, which are detoxification reactions, play important roles in the metabolism of the anesthetic. Three metabolites of Mepivacaine have been identified from adult humans: two phenols, which are excreted almost exclusively as their glucuronide conjugates, and the N-demethylated compound (2\u2019, 6\u2019 - pipecoloxylidide). The onset of action is rapid (30 to 120 seconds in the upper jaw; 1 to 4 minutes in the lower jaw) and Mepivacaine HCl 3% (30 mg/mL) will ordinarily provide operating anesthesia of 20 minutes in the upper jaw and 40 minutes in the lower jaw. Mepivacaine HCl 2% (20 mg/mL) with Levonordefrin 1:20,000 provides anesthesia of longer duration for more prolonged procedures, 1 hour to 2.5 hours in the upper jaw and 2.5 hours to 5.5 hours in the lower jaw.

When used for nerve blocks in dental patients, the time of onset for both forms of 2% Xylocaine DENTAL averages 2 - 4 minutes. 2% Xylocaine DENTAL with Epinephrine 1:50,000 (lidocaine HCI 2% solution with a 1:50,000 epinephrine concentration) or 2% Xylocaine DENTAL with Epinephrine 1:100,000 (lidocaine HCI 2% solution with a 1:100,000 epinephrine concentration) provide pulp anesthesia averaging at least 90 minutes with an average duration of soft tissue anesthesia of 3 to 3 \u00bd hours. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. Pharmacokinetics and metabolism Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentration of 1 to 4 \u00b5g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-l-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6.0 \u00b5g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey, arterial blood levels of 18 - 21 \u00b5g/mL have been shown to be the threshold for convulsive activity."], "manufacturer_name": ["Dentsply Pharmaceutical"], "substance_name": ["EPINEPHRINE BITARTRATE", "LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240205", "product_ndc": ["66312-176", "66312-181"], "brand_name": ["Xylocaine"]}
