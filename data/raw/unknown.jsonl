However, literature indicates that levonorgestrel is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration (bioavailability nearly 100%) and is not subject to first-pass metabolism. EE is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but, due to first-pass metabolism in gut mucosa and liver, the bioavailability of EE is approximately 43%. Following continuous dosing with once-daily administration of Iclevia tablets, plasma concentrations of levonorgestrel and EE reached steady-state within 7 days. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets under fasting conditions in normal healthy women following once-daily administration of one levonorgestrel/EE combination tablet for 10 days are summarized in Table 7.

Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of levonorgestrel and EE are reported to be approximately 1.8 L/kg and 4.3 L/kg, respectively. Levonorgestrel is about 97.5 to 99% protein-bound, principally to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and, to a lesser extent, serum albumin. EE is about 95 to 97% bound to serum albumin. EE does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis, which leads to decreased levonorgestrel clearance. Following repeated daily dosing of levonorgestrel/EE oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel plasma concentrations accumulate more than predicted based on single-dose pharmacokinetics, due in part, to increased SHBG levels that are induced by EE, and a possible reduction in hepatic metabolic capacity. Metabolism Following absorption, levonorgestrel is conjugated at the 17\u03b2-OH position to form sulfate and to a lesser extent, glucuronide conjugates in plasma. Significant amounts of conjugated and unconjugated 3\u03b1,5\u03b2-\u00adtetrahydrolevonorgestrel are also present in plasma, along with much smaller amounts of 3\u03b1,5\u03b1\u00ad-tetrahydrolevonorgestrel and 16\u03b2-hydroxylevonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel and its phase I metabolites are excreted primarily as glucuronide conjugates. Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several-fold, and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users. First-pass metabolism of EE involves formation of EE-3-sulfate in the gut wall, followed by 2-hydroxylation of a portion of the remaining untransformed EE by hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Levels of CYP3A4 vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of EE hydroxylation. Hydroxylation at the 4-, 6-, and 16- positions may also occur, although to a much lesser extent than 2-hydroxylation. The various hydroxylated metabolites are subject to further methylation and/or conjugation. Excretion About 45% of levonorgestrel and its metabolites are excreted in the urine and about 32% are excreted in feces, mostly as glucuronide conjugates. The terminal elimination half-life for levonorgestrel after a single dose of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets was about 30 hours. EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, and it undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. The terminal elimination half-life of EE after a single dose of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets was found to be about 15 hours."], "manufacturer_name": ["Aurobindo Pharma Limited"], "effective_time": "20240702", "product_ndc": ["65862-865"], "brand_name": ["Iclevia"]}

A single monthly injection of LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 mg results in an initial stimulation followed by a prolonged suppression of pituitary gonadotropins. Repeated dosing of LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 mg at monthly intervals results in decreased secretion of gonadal steroid. Consequently, tissues and functions that depend on gonadal steroids for their maintenance become quiescent. This effect is reversible on discontinuation of drug therapy. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Administration of LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 mg in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within three months after treatment is discontinued. Therefore, diagnostic tests of pituitary gonadotropic and gonadal functions conducted during treatment and for up to three months after discontinuation of LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 mg may be affected. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single IM injection of LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 mg in healthy female volunteers, absorption of leuprolide was characterized by an initial increase in plasma concentration, with peak concentration ranging from 4.6 to 10.2 ng/mL at four hours postdosing. However, intact leuprolide and an inactive metabolite could not be distinguished by the assay used in the study. Following the initial rise, leuprolide concentrations started to plateau within two days after dosing and remained relatively stable for about four to five weeks with plasma concentrations of about 0.30 ng/mL. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism Leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase. In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two-compartment model. The major metabolite (M-I, a pentapeptide) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine.

Each vial of ALTUVIIIO is labeled with the actual Factor VIII activity content in IU. The powder for injection is reconstituted with 3 mL sterile water for injection (sWFI) supplied in a sterile prefilled syringe. The reconstituted solution should be essentially free of particles. The final product contains the excipients: arginine hydrochloride (250 mM), calcium chloride dihydrate (5 mM), histidine (10 mM), polysorbate 80 (0.05% w/v), and sucrose (5% w/v). The active ingredient in ALTUVIIIO is a fully recombinant fusion protein comprising a single chain B-domain deleted (BDD) analogue of human FVIII covalently fused to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), the FVIII-binding D'D3 domain of human von Willebrand factor (VWF), and 2 XTEN polypeptides. ALTUVIIIO contains 2829 amino acids with an apparent molecular weight of 312 kDa. ALTUVIIIO is synthesized as 2 polypeptide chains which are covalently linked by 2 Fc hinge disulfide bonds. The first FVIII-XTEN-Fc polypeptide chain contains the A1A2 domain of FVIII along with 5 amino acids from B-domain (1\u2013745 amino acids) fused to the 288-XTEN polypeptide (in place of the natural FVIII B-domain), the A3C1C2 domain of FVIII (1649\u20132332), and the Fc domain of human IgG1.

ALTUVIIIO has demonstrated 3- to 4-fold prolonged half-life relative to other standard and extended half-life FVIII products. Mechanism of Half-life Extension ALTUVIIIO is a recombinant FVIII analogue fusion protein that is independent of endogenous VWF in order to overcome the half-life limit imposed by FVIII-VWF interactions. The D'D3 domain of VWF is the region that interacts with FVIII. Appending the D'D3 domain of VWF to a recombinant FVIII-Fc fusion protein provides protection and stability to FVIII, and prevents FVIII interaction with endogenous VWF, thus overcoming the limitation on FVIII half-life imposed by VWF clearance. The Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn is part of a naturally occurring pathway that delays lysosomal degradation of immunoglobulins by recycling them back into circulation, thus prolonging the plasma half-life of the fusion protein. ALTUVIIIO contains 2 XTEN polypeptides, which alter the hydrodynamic radius of the fusion protein, thus reducing rates of clearance and degradation, and improving pharmacokinetic properties. In ALTUVIIIO, the natural FVIII B domain (except 5 amino acids) is replaced with the first XTEN polypeptide, inserted in between FVIII N745 and E1649 amino acid residues; and the second XTEN polypeptide is inserted in between the D'D3 domain and Fc. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency of functional coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), which leads to a prolonged clotting time in the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one-stage clotting assay. Administration of ALTUVIIIO increases plasma levels of FVIII, temporarily correcting the coagulation defect in hemophilia A patients. Based on FVIII pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses, the risk of bleeding is negatively correlated with FVIII activity. Once weekly 50 IU/kg ALTUVIIIO provided factor VIII activity levels that were associated with a low bleed risk. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The PK of ALTUVIIIO were evaluated in prospective, open-label clinical studies, enrolling 159 adults and adolescents, and 74 children <12 years old, respectively, receiving weekly IV injections of 50 IU/kg. Among children <12 years old, 37 patients had ALTUVIIIO single dose PK profiles available. PK parameters following a single dose of ALTUVIIIO are presented in Table 4. The PK parameters were based on plasma FVIII activity measured by the aPTT-based one-stage clotting assay. After a single dose of 50 IU/kg, ALTUVIIIO exhibited high sustained FVIII activity with prolonged half-life across age cohorts. There was a trend of increasing area under the curve (AUC), and decreasing clearance, with increasing age in the pediatric cohorts. The PK profile at steady state (Week 26) was comparable with the PK profile obtained after the first dose.

The progestin in Natazia is dienogest (DNG). DNG displays properties of 19-nortestosterone derivatives as well as properties associated with progesterone derivatives. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of Natazia on QT prolongation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, positive (moxifloxacin 400 mg) and negative (placebo) controlled crossover study in healthy subjects. A total of 53 subjects were administered Natazia (containing 3 mg dienogest and 2 mg estradiol valerate), dienogest 10 mg, and placebo as once daily doses for 4 days, and moxifloxacin 400 mg as a single oral dose. The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on Fridericia\u2019s correction method (QTcF) was below 10 msec, the threshold for regulatory concern. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of estradiol valerate, cleavage to 17\u03b2-estradiol and valeric acid takes place during absorption by the intestinal mucosa or in the course of the first liver passage. This gives rise to estradiol and its metabolites, estrone and other metabolites. Maximum serum estradiol concentrations of 73.3 pg/mL are reached at a median of approximately 6 hours (range: 1.5\u201312 hours) and the area under the estradiol concentration curve [AUC(0\u201324h)] was 1301 pg\u00b7h/mL after single ingestion of a tablet containing 3 mg estradiol valerate under fasted condition on Day 1 of the 28-day sequential regimen. Bioavailability of dienogest is about 91%. Maximum serum dienogest concentrations of 91.7 ng/mL are reached at a median of approximately 1 hour (range: 0.5\u20131.5 hour) and the area under the dienogest concentration curve [AUC(0\u201324h)] was 964 ng/mL after single oral administration of Natazia tablet containing 2 mg estradiol valerate/3 mg dienogest under fasted condition. The pharmacokinetics of dienogest are dose-proportional within the dose range of 1\u20138 mg. Steady state is reached after 4 days of the same dosage of 2 mg dienogest. The mean accumulation ratio for AUC (0\u201324h) is approximately 1.24. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state following repeated oral doses of a 2 mg estradiol valerate/3 mg dienogest combination tablet in fertile women under fasted condition are reported in Table 1. Table 1 Arithmetic Mean (SD) Serum Pharmacokinetic Parameters at Steady-state (on Day 24) following Repeated Oral Doses of 2 mg EV/3 mg DNG on Days 8-24 of the 28 day Regimen in Fertile Women under Fasted Condition (N=15) Parameter Dienogest Estradiol Estrone C max C max = Maximum serum concentration 85.2 (19.7) ng/ml 70.5 (25.9) pg/ml 483 (198) pg/ml T max Tmax = Time to reach maximum concentration (h) Median (range) for T max 1.5 (1\u20132) 3 (1.5\u201312) 4 (3\u201312) AUC AUC(0-24h) = Area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h data point up to 48 h post-administration (0\u201324h) 828 (187) ng\u00b7h/ml 1323 (480) pg\u00b7h/ml 7562 (3403) pg\u00b7h/ml t \u00bd (h) 12.3 (1.4) NA NA: Data not available NA Food Effect Concomitant food intake in women resulted in a 28% decrease for dienogest C max and 23% increase of estradiol C max while the exposure (AUC) of both dienogest and estradiol did not change. Distribution In serum, 38% of estradiol is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), 60% to albumin and 2\u20133% circulates in free form. An apparent volume of distribution of approximately 1.2 L/kg was determined after intravenous (IV) administration. A relatively high fraction (10%) of circulating dienogest is present in the free form, with approximately 90% being bound non-specifically to albumin. Dienogest does not bind to SHBG and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG). The volume of distribution at steady state (V d,ss ) of dienogest is 46 L after the IV administration of 85 mcg 3 H-dienogest. Metabolism After oral administration of estradiol valerate, approximately 3% of the dose is directly bioavailable as estradiol. Estradiol undergoes an extensive first-pass effect and a considerable part of the dose administered is already metabolized in the gastrointestinal mucosa. The CYP 3A family is known to play the most important role in human estradiol metabolism. Together with the pre-systemic metabolism in the liver, about 95% of the orally administered dose becomes metabolized before entering the systemic circulation. The main metabolites are estrone and its sulfate or glucuronide conjugates. Dienogest is extensively metabolized by the known pathways of steroid metabolism (hydroxylation, conjugation), with the formation of endocrinologically mostly inactive metabolites. CYP3A4 was identified as a predominant enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of dienogest. Excretion Estradiol and its metabolites are mainly excreted in urine, with about 10% being excreted in the feces. The terminal half-life of estradiol is approximately 14 hours. Dienogest is mainly excreted renally in the form of metabolites and unchanged dienogest is the dominating fraction in plasma. The terminal half-life of dienogest is approximately 11 hours. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy of Natazia has been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated. Geriatric Use : Natazia has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population. Renal Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of Natazia has not been studied in subjects with renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of Natazia has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal. [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ).] Body Mass Index : The efficacy of Natazia in women with a BMI of > 30 kg/m 2 has not been evaluated. Drug Interactions Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with oral contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Dienogest is a substrate of CYP3A4. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. The effect of the CYP3A4 inducer rifampin was studied in an open-label, non-randomized, single center study in 16 healthy postmenopausal women. All volunteers received a treatment regimen of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 3 mg dienogest combination tablets, dosed once daily over 17 days, and of rifampin, which was administered once daily in an oral dose of 600 mg on Days 12 to 16. Twenty-four-hour (24h) pharmacokinetics of estradiol and dienogest on Days 11 and 17 were compared. Co-administration of rifampin with estradiol valerate/dienogest tablets led to a 52 % and 83% decrease in the mean Cmax and AUC(0\u201324h), respectively, for dienogest and a 25% and 44% decrease in Cmax and AUC(0\u201324h), respectively, for estradiol at steady state. Substances Increasing the Systemic Exposure of COCs (enzyme inhibitors): The effect of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, on dienogest and estradiol exposure was studied in an open-label, one-sequence, one-way crossover study in healthy postmenopausal Caucasian women. One tablet of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 3 mg dienogest was administered orally once a day for 14 days. Twelve volunteers received an oral dose of 400 mg ketoconazole (that is, 2 tablets containing 200 mg ketoconazole) once daily for 7 days (Days 8\u201314). Twenty-four hour pharmacokinetics of estradiol and dienogest on Days 7 and 14 were compared. Co-administration with the strong inhibitor ketoconazole increased the AUC (0\u201324h) at steady state for dienogest and estradiol by 2.86 and 1.57-fold, respectively. There was also a 1.94 and 1.65-fold increase of Cmax at steady state for dienogest and estradiol when co-administered with ketoconazole. The effect of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, erythromycin, on dienogest and estradiol exposure was studied in an open-label, one-sequence, one-way crossover study in healthy postmenopausal Caucasian women. One tablet of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 3 mg dienogest was administered orally once a day for 14 days. Twelve volunteers received an oral dose of 500 mg erythromycin three times a day for 7 days (Days 8\u201314). Twenty-four hour pharmacokinetics of estradiol and dienogest on Days 7 and 14 were compared. When co-administered with the moderate inhibitor erythromycin, the AUC (0\u201324h) of dienogest and estradiol at steady state were increased by 1.62 and 1.33-fold, respectively. There was also a 1.33 and 1.51-fold increase of Cmax at steady state for dienogest and estradiol, respectively, when co-administered with erythromycin. HIV/HCV Protease Inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro studies with human CYP enzymes did not indicate an inhibitory potential of dienogest at clinically relevant concentrations. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "effective_time": "20240626", "product_ndc": ["50419-409"], "brand_name": ["Natazia"]}

Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation). Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 have not been characterized; however, the following pharmacokinetic information regarding norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol is taken from the literature. Absorption Norethindrone acetate appears to be completely and rapidly deacetylated to norethindrone after oral administration, since the disposition of norethindrone acetate is indistinguishable from that of orally administered norethindrone ( 1 ). Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol are subject to first-pass metabolism after oral dosing, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 64% for norethindrone and 43% for ethinyl estradiol ( 1-3 ). Distribution Volume of distribution of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol ranges from 2 to 4 L/kg ( 1-3 ). Plasma protein binding of both steroids is extensive (greater than 95%); norethindrone binds to both albumin and sex hormone binding globulin, whereas ethinyl estradiol binds only to albumin ( 4 ). Metabolism Norethindrone undergoes extensive biotransformation, primarily via reduction, followed by sulfate and glucuronide conjugation. The majority of metabolites in the circulation are sulfates, with glucuronides accounting for most of the urinary metabolites ( 5 ). A small amount of norethindrone acetate is metabolically converted to ethinyl estradiol. Ethinyl estradiol is also extensively metabolized, both by oxidation and by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide. Sulfates are the major circulating conjugates of ethinyl estradiol and glucuronides predominate in urine. The primary oxidative metabolite is 2-hydroxy ethinyl estradiol, formed by the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450. Part of the first-pass metabolism of ethinyl estradiol is believed to occur in gastrointestinal mucosa. Ethinyl estradiol may undergo enterohepatic circulation ( 6 ). Excretion Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are excreted in both urine and feces, primarily as metabolites (5,6) . Plasma clearance values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are similar (approximately 0.4 L/hr/kg) ( 1-3 ). Special Population Race The effect of race on the disposition of Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 has not been evaluated. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal disease on the disposition of Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 has not been evaluated. In premenopausal women with chronic renal failure undergoing peritoneal dialysis who received multiple doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations were higher and norethindrone concentrations were unchanged compared to concentrations in premenopausal women with normal renal function. Hepatic Insufficiency The effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 has not been evaluated. However, ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Romidepsin is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from acetylated lysine residues in histones, resulting in the modulation of gene expression. HDACs also deacetylate non-histone proteins, such as transcription factors. In vitro, romidepsin causes the accumulation of acetylated histones, and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of some cancer cell lines with IC 50 values in the nanomolar range. The mechanism of the antineoplastic effect of romidepsin observed in nonclinical and clinical studies has not been fully characterized. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology At doses of 14 mg/m 2 as a 4-hour intravenous infusion, and at doses of 8 (0.57 times the recommended dose), 10 (0.71 times the recommended dose) or 12 (0.86 times the recommended dose) mg/m 2 as a 1-hour infusion, no large changes in the mean QTc interval (>20 milliseconds) from baseline based on Fridericia correction method were detected. Small increase in mean QT interval (< 10 milliseconds) and mean QT interval increase between 10 to 20 milliseconds cannot be excluded. Romidepsin was associated with a delayed concentration-dependent increase in heart rate in patients with advanced cancer with a maximum mean increase in heart rate of 20 beats per minute occurring at the 6-hour time point after start of romidepsin infusion for patients receiving 14 mg/m 2 as a 4-hour infusion. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with T-cell lymphomas who received 14 mg/m 2 of romidepsin intravenously over a 4-hour period on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, geometric mean values of the maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) were 377 ng/mL and 1549 ng*hr/mL, respectively. Romidepsin exhibited linear pharmacokinetics across doses ranging from 1.0 (0.07 times the recommended dose) to 24.9 (1.76 times the recommended dose) mg/m 2 when administered intravenously over 4 hours in patients with advanced cancers. Distribution Romidepsin is highly protein bound in plasma (92% to 94%) over the concentration range of 50 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL with \u03b11-acid-glycoprotein (AAG) being the principal binding protein. Romidepsin is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1). In vitro, romidepsin accumulates into human hepatocytes via an unknown active uptake process. Romidepsin is not a substrate of the following uptake transporters: BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT2. In addition, romidepsin is not an inhibitor of BCRP, MRP2, MDR1 or OAT3. Although romidepsin did not inhibit OAT1, OCT2, and OATP1B3 at concentrations seen clinically (1 \u03bcmol/L), modest inhibition was observed at 10 \u00b5mol/L. Romidepsin was found to be an inhibitor of BSEP and OATP1B1. Metabolism Romidepsin undergoes extensive metabolism in vitro primarily by CYP3A4 with minor contribution from CYP3A5, CYP1A1, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19. At therapeutic concentrations, romidepsin did not competitively inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4 in vitro. At therapeutic concentrations, romidepsin did not cause notable induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in vitro. Therefore, pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions are unlikely to occur due to CYP450 induction or inhibition by romidepsin when co-administered with CYP450 substrates. Excretion Following 4-hour intravenous administration of romidepsin at 14 mg/m 2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle in patients with T-cell lymphomas, the terminal half-life (t \u00bd ) was approximately 3 hours. No accumulation of plasma concentration of romidepsin was observed after repeated dosing. Drug Interactions Ketoconazole: Following co-administration of 8 mg/m 2 ISTODAX (4-hour infusion) with ketoconazole, the overall romidepsin exposure was increased by approximately 25% and 10% for AUC 0-\u221e and C max , respectively, compared to romidepsin alone, and the difference in AUC 0-\u221e between the 2 treatments was statistically significant. Rifampin: Following co-administration of 14 mg/m 2 ISTODAX (4-hour infusion) with rifampin, the overall romidepsin exposure was increased by approximately 80% and 60% for AUC 0-\u221e and C max , respectively, compared to romidepsin alone, and the difference between the 2 treatments was statistically significant. Co-administration of rifampin decreased the romidepsin clearance and volume of distribution by 44% and 52%, respectively. The increase in exposure seen after co-administration with rifampin is likely due to rifampin's inhibition of an undetermined hepatic uptake process that is predominant for the disposition of ISTODAX . Drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein: Drugs that inhibit p-glycoprotein may increase the concentration of romidepsin. Specific Populations Effect of Age, Gender, Race or Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of romidepsin was not influenced by age (27 to 83 yrs), gender, race (white vs . black) or mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 - 80 mL/min), moderate (estimated creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min), or severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment.

NGM is rapidly and completely metabolized by first pass (intestinal and/or hepatic) mechanisms to norelgestromin (NGMN) and norgestrel (NG), which are the major active metabolites of norgestimate. Peak serum concentrations of NGMN and EE are generally reached by 2 hours after administration of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Accumulation following multiple dosing of the 250 mcg NGM / 35 mcg EE dose is approximately 2-fold for NGMN and EE compared with single dose administration. The pharmacokinetics of NGMN is dose-proportional following NGM doses of 180 mcg to 250 mcg. Steady-state concentration of EE is achieved by Day 7 of each dosing cycle. Steady-state concentrations of NGMN and NG are achieved by Day 21. Non-linear accumulation (approximately 8 fold) of NG is observed as a result of high-affinity binding to SHBG, which limits its biological activity (Table 3).

Distribution NGMN and NG are highly bound (>97%) to serum proteins. NGMN is bound to albumin and not to SHBG, while NG is bound primarily to SHBG. EE is extensively bound (>97%) to serum albumin and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of SHBG. Metabolism NGM is extensively metabolized by first-pass mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract and/or liver. NGM's primary active metabolite is NGMN. Subsequent hepatic metabolism of NGMN occurs and metabolites include NG, which is also active, and various hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites. Although NGMN and its metabolites inhibit a variety of P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes, under the recommended dosing regimen, the in vivo concentrations of NGMN and its metabolites, even at the peak serum levels, are relatively low compared to the inhibitory constant (K i ). EE is also metabolized to various hydroxylated products and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Excretion The metabolites of NGMN and EE are eliminated by renal and fecal pathways. Following administration of 14 C-norgestimate, 47% (45 to 49%) and 37% (16 to 49%) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and feces, respectively. Unchanged NGM was not detected in the urine. In addition to 17-deacetyl norgestimate, a number of metabolites of NGM have been identified in human urine following administration of radiolabeled NGM.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After topical administration to healthy human volunteers of single and multiple maximum doses of diclofenac sodium topical solution, 40 drops (approximately 1.2 mL) to each knee (80 drops total dose), the following diclofenac pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained: (see Table 3 ).

Distribution Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac. Elimination Metabolism Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Excretion Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Special Populations Pediatric: The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical solution has not been investigated in pediatric patients. Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interaction Studies Aspirin: When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered.

Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation). Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of Junel have not been characterized; however, the following pharmacokinetic information regarding norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol is taken from the literature. Absorption Norethindrone acetate appears to be completely and rapidly deacetylated to norethindrone after oral administration, since the disposition of norethindrone acetate is indistinguishable from that of orally administered norethindrone (1). Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol are subject to first-pass metabolism after oral dosing, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 64% for norethindrone and 43% for ethinyl estradiol (1-3). Distribution Volume of distribution of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol ranges from 2 to 4 L/kg (1 to 3). Plasma protein binding of both steroids is extensive (greater than 95%); norethindrone binds to both albumin and sex hormone binding globulin, whereas ethinyl estradiol binds only to albumin (4). Metabolism Norethindrone undergoes extensive biotransformation, primarily via reduction, followed by sulfate and glucuronide conjugation. The majority of metabolites in the circulation are sulfates, with glucuronides accounting for most of the urinary metabolites (5). A small amount of norethindrone acetate is metabolically converted to ethinyl estradiol. Ethinyl estradiol is also extensively metabolized, both by oxidation and by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide. Sulfates are the major circulating conjugates of ethinyl estradiol and glucuronides predominate in urine. The primary oxidative metabolite is 2-hydroxy ethinyl estradiol, formed by the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450. Part of the first-pass metabolism of ethinyl estradiol is believed to occur in gastrointestinal mucosa. Ethinyl estradiol may undergo enterohepatic circulation (6). Excretion Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are excreted in both urine and feces, primarily as metabolites (5, 6). Plasma clearance values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are similar (approximately 0.4 L/hr/kg) (1-3). Special Population Race: The effect of race on the disposition of Junel has not been evaluated. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal disease on the disposition of Junel has not been evaluated. In premenopausal women with chronic renal failure undergoing peritoneal dialysis who received multiple doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations were higher and norethindrone concentrations were unchanged compared to concentrations in premenopausal women with normal renal function. Hepatic Insufficiency The effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of Junel has not been evaluated. However, ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.

Hydrochloric acid is added as necessary to adjust pH."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-fkjp may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131 \u00b1 56 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis: In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis: In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis: Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Uveitis: Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa: In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to >75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: 4 years to 17 years of age: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing <30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u226530 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. 2 years to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u2265 40 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing < 40 kg. Male and Female Patients: No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient\u2019s body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important. Drug Interaction Studies: Methotrexate: MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Golden State Medical Supply Inc."], "effective_time": "20241226", "product_ndc": ["51407-834", "51407-835"], "brand_name": ["Adalimumab"]}

The ferrous fumarate tablets are present to facilitate ease of drug administration via a 28-day regimen, are non-hormonal, and do not serve any therapeutic purpose. Each white to off white tablet contains 1 mg norethindrone acetate [(17 alpha)- 17-(acetyloxy)-19-norpregna-4-en-20-yn-3-one] and 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol [(17 alpha)- 19-norpregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3,17-diol]; each light purple tablet contains 1 mg norethindrone acetate and 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol; and each purple tablet contains 1 mg norethindrone acetate, 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ORAL CONTRACEPTION Combined oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation). In vitro and animal studies have shown that norethindrone combines high progestational activity with low intrinsic androgenicity. In humans, norethindrone acetate in combination with ethinyl estradiol does not counteract estrogen-induced increases in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Following multiple-dose administration of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets, serum SHBG concentrations increase two- to three-fold and free testosterone concentrations decrease by 47% to 64%, indicating minimal androgenic activity. ACNE Acne is a skin condition with a multifactorial etiology, including androgen stimulation of sebum production. While the combination of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and decreases free testosterone, the relationship between these changes and a decrease in the severity of facial acne in otherwise healthy women with this skin condition has not been established. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Norethindrone acetate appears to be completely and rapidly deacetylated to norethindrone after oral administration, since the disposition of norethindrone acetate is indistinguishable from that of orally administered norethindrone. Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol are rapidly absorbed, with maximum plasma concentrations of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol occurring 1 to 2 hours post-dose. Both are subject to first-pass metabolism after oral dosing, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 64% for norethindrone and 43% for ethinyl estradiol. Administration of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol with a high fat meal decreases rate, but not extent, of ethinyl estradiol absorption. The extent of norethindrone absorption is increased by 27% following administration with food. Plasma concentrations of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following chronic administration of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets to 17 women are shown below (Figure 1). Mean steady-state concentrations of norethindrone for the 1/20, 1/30, and 1/35 tablet strengths increased as ethinyl estradiol dose increased over the 21-day dose regimen, due to dose-dependent effects of ethinyl estradiol on serum SHBG concentrations (Table 1). Mean steady-state plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol for the 1/20, 1/30, and 1/35 tablet strengths were proportional to ethinyl estradiol dose (Table 1). Figure 1.

Distribution Volume of distribution of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol ranges from 2 to 4 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of both steroids is extensive (> 95%); norethindrone binds to both albumin and sex hormone binding globulin, whereas ethinyl estradiol binds only to albumin. Although ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, it induces SHBG synthesis. Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets increase serum SHBG concentrations two- to three-fold (Table 1). Metabolism Norethindrone undergoes extensive biotransformation, primarily via reduction, followed by sulfate and glucuronide conjugation. The majority of metabolites in the circulation are sulfates, with glucuronides accounting for most of the urinary metabolites. A small amount of norethindrone acetate is metabolically converted to ethinyl estradiol. Ethinyl estradiol is also extensively metabolized, both by oxidation and by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide. Sulfates are the major circulating conjugates of ethinyl estradiol and glucuronides predominate in urine. The primary oxidative metabolite is 2-hydroxy ethinyl estradiol, formed by the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450. Part of the first-pass metabolism of ethinyl estradiol is believed to occur in gastrointestinal mucosa. Ethinyl estradiol may undergo enterohepatic circulation. Excretion Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are excreted in both urine and feces, primarily as metabolites. Plasma clearance values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are similar (approximately 0.4 L/hr/kg). Steady-state elimination half-lives of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets are approximately 13 hours and 19 hours, respectively. Concentrations SPECIAL POPULATION Race The effect of race on the disposition of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets has not been evaluated. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal disease on the disposition of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets has not been evaluated. In premenopausal women with chronic renal failure undergoing peritoneal dialysis who received multiple doses of a combined oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations were higher and norethindrone concentrations were unchanged compared to concentrations in premenopausal women with normal renal function. Hepatic Insufficiency The effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets has not been evaluated. However, ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.

The essential features of PMDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-4th edition (DSM-IV) include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. In this disorder, these symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school, or with usual social activities and relationships with others. Diagnosis is made by healthcare providers according to DSM-IV criteria, with symptomatology assessed prospectively over at least two menstrual cycles. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders. Yaz has not been evaluated for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). 1.3 Acne Yaz is indicated for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris in women at least 14 years of age, who have no known contraindications to oral contraceptive therapy and have achieved menarche.

The estrogen in Yaz is ethinyl estradiol. Contraception Two studies evaluated the effect of 3 mg DRSP / 0.02 mg EE combinations on the suppression of ovarian activity as assessed by measurement of follicle size via transvaginal ultrasound and serum hormone (progesterone and estradiol) analyses during two treatment cycles (21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period). More than 90% of subjects in these studies demonstrated ovulation inhibition. One study compared the effect of 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE combinations with two different regimens (24-day active tablet period plus 4-day pill-free period vs. 21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period) on the suppression of ovarian activity during two treatment cycles. During the first treatment cycle, there were no subjects (0/49, 0%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 1 subject (1/50, 2%) using the 21-day regimen. After intentionally introduced dosing errors (3 missed active tablets on Days 1 to 3) during the second treatment cycle, there was 1 subject (1/49, 2%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 4 subjects (4/50, 8%) using the 21-day regimen. Acne Acne vulgaris is a skin condition with a multifactorial etiology including androgen stimulation of sebum production. While the combination of EE and DRSP increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and decreases free testosterone, the relationship between these changes and a decrease in the severity of facial acne in otherwise healthy women with this skin condition has not been established. The impact of the antiandrogenic activity of DRSP on acne is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of DRSP from a single entity tablet is about 76%. The absolute bioavailability of EE is approximately 40% as a result of presystemic conjugation and first-pass metabolism . The absolute bioavailability of Yaz , which is a combination tablet of DRSP and EE stabilized by betadex as a clathrate (molecular inclusion complex), has not been evaluated. The bioavailability of EE is similar when dosed via a betadex clathrate formulation compared to when it is dosed as a free steroid. Serum concentrations of DRSP and EE reached peak levels within 1\u20132 hours after administration of Yaz. The pharmacokinetics of DRSP are dose proportional following single doses ranging from 1\u201310 mg. Following daily dosing of Yaz, steady state DRSP concentrations were observed after 8 days. There was about 2 to 3 fold accumulation in serum C max and AUC (0\u201324h) values of DRSP following multiple dose administration of Yaz (see Table 3). For EE, steady-state conditions are reported during the second half of a treatment cycle. Following daily administration of Yaz, serum C max and AUC (0\u201324h) values of EE accumulate by a factor of about 1.5 to 2 (see Table 3).

The extent of absorption of DRSP, however, remained unchanged. In contrast, the extent of absorption of EE was reduced by about 20% under fed conditions. Distribution DRSP and EE serum concentrations decline in two phases. The apparent volume of distribution of DRSP is approximately 4 L/kg and that of EE is reported to be approximately 4-5 L/kg. DRSP does not bind to SHBG or corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) but binds about 97% to other serum proteins. Multiple dosing over 3 cycles resulted in no change in the free fraction (as measured at trough concentrations). EE is reported to be highly but non-specifically bound to serum albumin (approximately 98.5 %) and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of both SHBG and CBG. EE induced effects on SHBG and CBG were not affected by variation of the DRSP dosage in the range of 2 to 3 mg. Metabolism The two main metabolites of DRSP found in human plasma were identified to be the acid form of DRSP generated by opening of the lactone ring and the 4,5-dihydrodrospirenone-3-sulfate, formed by reduction and subsequent sulfation. These metabolites were shown not to be pharmacologically active. Drospirenone is also subject to oxidative metabolism catalyzed by CYP3A4. EE has been reported to be subject to significant gut and hepatic first-pass metabolism. Metabolism of EE and its oxidative metabolites occur primarily by conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. CYP3A4 in the liver is responsible for the 2-hydroxylation which is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion. Excretion DRSP serum concentrations are characterized by a terminal disposition phase half-life of approximately 30 hours after both single and multiple dose regimens. Excretion of DRSP was nearly complete after ten days and amounts excreted were slightly higher in feces compared to urine. DRSP was extensively metabolized and only trace amounts of unchanged DRSP were excreted in urine and feces. At least 20 different metabolites were observed in urine and feces. About 38\u201347% of the metabolites in urine were glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In feces, about 17\u201320% of the metabolites were excreted as glucuronides and sulfates. For EE the terminal disposition phase half-life has been reported to be approximately 24 hours. EE is not excreted unchanged. EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric Use : Safety and efficacy of Yaz has been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated. Geriatric Use : Yaz has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population. Race: No clinically significant difference was observed between the pharmacokinetics of DRSP or EE in Japanese versus Caucasian women (age 25\u201335) when 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE was administered daily for 21 days. Other ethnic groups have not been specifically studied. Renal Impairment : Yaz is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of DRSP (3 mg daily for 14 days) and the effect of DRSP on serum potassium concentrations were investigated in three separate groups of female subjects (n=28, age 30\u201365). All subjects were on a low potassium diet. During the study, 7 subjects continued the use of potassium-sparing drugs for the treatment of their underlying illness. On the 14th day (steady-state) of DRSP treatment, the serum DRSP concentrations in the group with CLcr of 50\u201379 mL/min were comparable to those in the control group with CLcr \u2265 80 mL/min. The serum DRSP concentrations were on average 37% higher in the group with CLcr of 30\u201349 mL/min compared to those in the control group. DRSP treatment did not show any clinically significant effect on serum potassium concentration. Although hyperkalemia was not observed in the study, in five of the seven subjects who continued use of potassium-sparing drugs during the study, mean serum potassium concentrations increased by up to 0.33 mEq/L. [See Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) . ] Hepatic Impairment: Yaz is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease. The mean exposure to DRSP in women with moderate liver impairment is approximately three times higher than the exposure in women with normal liver function. Yaz has not been studied in women with severe hepatic impairment. [See Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ).] Drug Interactions Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with oral contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in 20 premenopausal women, co-administration of a DRSP (3 mg)/EE (0.02 mg) COC with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) for 10 days increased the AUC(0-24h) of DRSP and EE by 2.68-fold (90% CI: 2.44, 2.95) and 1.40-fold (90% CI: 1.31, 1.49), respectively. The increases in C max were 1.97-fold (90% CI: 1.79, 2.17) and 1.39-fold (90% CI: 1.28, 1.52) for DRSP and EE, respectively. Although no clinically relevant effects on safety or laboratory parameters including serum potassium were observed, this study only assessed subjects for 10 days. The clinical impact for a patient taking a DRSP-containing COC concomitantly with chronic use of a CYP3A4/5 inhibitor is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . HIV/HCV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro , EE is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 as well as a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8, and CYP2J2. Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic CYP enzymes have been investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies. In in vitro studies DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women [including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype] the daily oral administration of 3 mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the oral clearance of omeprazole (40 mg, single oral dose) and the CYP2C19 product 5-hydroxy omeprazole. Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found. These results demonstrate that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in vivo . Two additional clinical drug-drug interaction studies using simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrates for CYP3A4 were each performed in 24 healthy postmenopausal women. The results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steady state DRSP concentrations achieved after administration of 3 mg DRSP/day. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Interactions With Drugs That Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration : There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Yaz with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . A drug-drug interaction study of DRSP 3 mg/estradiol (E2) 1 mg versus placebo was performed in 24 mildly hypertensive postmenopausal women taking enalapril maleate 10 mg twice daily. Potassium concentrations were obtained every other day for a total of 2 weeks in all subjects. Mean serum potassium concentrations in the DRSP/E2 treatment group relative to baseline were 0.22 mEq/L higher than those in the placebo group. Serum potassium concentrations also were measured at multiple time points over 24 hours at baseline and on Day 14. On Day 14, the ratios for serum potassium C max and AUC in the DRSP/E2 group to those in the placebo group were 0.955 (90% CI: 0.914, 0.999) and 1.010 (90% CI: 0.944, 1.08), respectively. No patient in either treatment group developed hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentrations > 5.5 mEq/L)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "effective_time": "20230519", "product_ndc": ["50419-405"], "brand_name": ["Yaz"]}

Structuralformula-200"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Investigations into the mode of action of furosemide have utilized micropuncture studies in rats, stop flow experiments in dogs and various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. It has been demonstrated that furosemide inhibits primarily the absorption of sodium and chloride not only in the proximal and distal tubules but also in the loop of Henle. The high degree of efficacy is largely due to the unique site of action. The action on the distal tubule is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone. Recent evidence suggests that furosemide glucuronide is the only or at least the major biotransformation product of furosemide in man. Furosemide is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. Plasma concentrations ranging from 1 to 400 mcg/mL are 91 to 99% bound in healthy individuals. The unbound fraction averages 2.3 to 4.1% at therapeutic concentrations. The onset of diuresis following oral administration is within 1 hour. The peak effect occurs within the first or second hour. The duration of diuretic effect is 6 to 8 hours. In fasted normal men, the mean bioavailability of furosemide from furosemide tablets and furosemide oral solution is 64% and 60%, respectively, of that from an intravenous injection of the drug. Although furosemide is more rapidly absorbed from the oral solution (50 minutes) than from the tablet (87 minutes), peak plasma levels and area under the plasma concentration-time curves do not differ significantly. Peak plasma concentrations increase with increasing dose but times-to-peak do not differ among doses. The terminal half-life of furosemide is approximately 2 hours. Significantly more furosemide is excreted in urine following the IV injection than after the tablet or oral solution. There are no significant differences between the two oral formulations in the amount of unchanged drug excreted in urine. Geriatric Population Furosemide binding to albumin may be reduced in elderly patients. Furosemide is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine. The renal clearance of furosemide after intravenous administration in older healthy male subjects (60 to 70 years of age) is statistically significantly smaller than in younger healthy male subjects (20 to 35 years of age).

LUXTURNA is a live, non-replicating adeno-associated virus serotype 2 which has been genetically modified to express the human RPE65 gene. LUXTURNA is derived from naturally occurring adeno-associated virus using recombinant DNA techniques. Each single-dose vial of LUXTURNA contains 5 x 10 12 vector genomes (vg) per mL, and the excipients 180 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, and 0.001% Poloxamer 188 (pH 7.3), in a 0.5-mL extractable volume. LUXTURNA requires a 1:10 dilution prior to administration. After dilution, each dose of LUXTURNA consists of 1.5 x 10 11 vg in a deliverable volume of 0.3 mL. The Diluent, supplied in 1.7 mL extractable volume per vial in two 2-mL vials, is composed of sterile water containing 180 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, and 0.001% Poloxamer 188 (pH 7.3).

The RPE65 is produced in the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and converts all- trans -retinol to 11- cis -retinol, which subsequently forms the chromophore, 11- cis -retinal, during the visual (retinoid) cycle. The visual cycle is critical in phototransduction, which refers to the biological conversion of a photon of light into an electrical signal in the retina. Mutations in the RPE65 gene lead to reduced or absent levels of retinoid isomerohydrolase RPE65 activity, blocking the visual cycle and resulting in impairment of vision. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Injection of LUXTURNA into the subretinal space results in transduction of some retinal pigment epithelial cells with a cDNA encoding normal human RPE65 protein, thus providing the potential to restore the visual cycle. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Biodistribution (within the body) and Vector Shedding (excretion/secretion) LUXTURNA vector DNA levels in various tissues and secretions were determined using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. Nonclinical data Biodistribution of LUXTURNA was evaluated at three months following subretinal administration in non-human primates. The highest levels of vector DNA sequences were detected in intraocular fluids (anterior chamber fluid and vitreous) of vector-injected eyes. Low levels of vector DNA sequences were detected in the optic nerve of the vector-injected eye, optic chiasm, spleen and liver, and sporadically in the lymph nodes. Vector DNA sequences were not detected in the gonads. Clinical data LUXTURNA vector shedding and biodistribution were investigated in a study measuring LUXTURNA DNA in tears from both eyes, and from serum, and whole blood of subjects in Study 2. In summary, LUXTURNA vector was shed transiently and at low levels in tears from the injected eye in 45% of the subjects in Study 2, and occasionally (7%) from the uninjected eye until Day 3 post-injection. In 29 subjects who received bilateral administrations, LUXTURNA vector DNA was present in tear samples of 13 subjects (45%). Peak levels of vector DNA were detected in the tear samples on Day 1 post-injection, after which no vector DNA was detected in a majority of the subjects (8 of 13). Three subjects (10%) had vector DNA in tear samples until Day 3 post-injection, and two subjects (7%) had vector DNA in tear samples for around two weeks post-injection. In another two subjects (7%), vector DNA was detected in tear samples from the uninjected (or previously injected) eye until Day 3 post-injection. Vector DNA was detected in serum in 3/29 (10%) subjects, including two with vector DNA in tear samples up to Day 3 following each injection.

Sodium hydroxide is added to adjust pH."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with IDACIO may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131 \u00b1 56 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (V ss ) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis: In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis : In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis : Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Uveitis : Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa : Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis : Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa: In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients : A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to >75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis : \u2022 4 years to 17 years of age: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing <30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u226530 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. \u2022 2 years to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Crohn's Disease : Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u2265 40 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing < 40 kg. Male and Female Patients : No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient\u2019s body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important. Drug Interaction Studies: Methotrexate : MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC"], "effective_time": "20241015", "product_ndc": ["65219-558"], "brand_name": ["IDACIO"]}

Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation). Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of Microgestin 1/20 has not been characterized; however, the following pharmacokinetic information regarding norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol is taken from the literature. Absorption Norethindrone acetate appears to be completely and rapidly deacetylated to norethindrone after oral administration, since the disposition of norethindrone acetate is indistinguishable from that of orally administered norethindrone (1) . Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol are subject to first-pass metabolism after oral dosing, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 64% for norethindrone and 43% for ethinyl estradiol (1 to 3) . Distribution Volume of distribution of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol ranges from 2 to 4 L/kg (1 to 3) . Plasma protein binding of both steroids is extensive (> 95%); norethindrone binds to both albumin and sex hormone binding globulin, whereas ethinyl estradiol binds only to albumin (4) . Metabolism Norethindrone undergoes extensive biotransformation, primarily via reduction, followed by sulfate and glucuronide conjugation. The majority of metabolites in the circulation are sulfates, with glucuronides accounting for most of the urinary metabolites (5) . A small amount of norethindrone acetate is metabolically converted to ethinyl estradiol. Ethinyl estradiol is also extensively metabolized, both by oxidation and by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide. Sulfates are the major circulating conjugates of ethinyl estradiol and glucuronides predominate in urine. The primary oxidative metabolite is 2-hydroxy ethinyl estradiol, formed by the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450. Part of the first-pass metabolism of ethinyl estradiol is believed to occur in gastrointestinal mucosa. Ethinyl estradiol may undergo enterohepatic circulation (6) . Excretion Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are excreted in both urine and feces, primarily as metabolites (5,6) . Plasma clearance values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are similar (approximately 0.4 L/hr/kg) (1 to 3) . Special Population Race The effect of race on the disposition of Microgestin 1/20 has not been evaluated. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal disease on the disposition of Microgestin 1/20 has not been evaluated. In premenopausal women with chronic renal failure undergoing peritoneal dialysis who received multiple doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations were higher and norethindrone concentrations were unchanged compared to concentrations in premenopausal women with normal renal function. Hepatic Insufficiency The effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of Microgestin 1/20 has not been evaluated. However, ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.

The cDNA coding for rasburicase was cloned from a strain of Aspergillus flavus. Rasburicase is a tetrameric protein with identical subunits.

Rasburicase catalyzes enzymatic oxidation of poorly soluble uric acid into an inactive and more soluble metabolite (allantoin). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The measurement of plasma uric acid was used to evaluate the effectiveness of rasburicase in clinical studies. Following administration of either 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg rasburicase daily for up to 5 days, plasma uric acid levels decreased within 4 hours and were maintained below 7.5 mg/dL in 98% of adult and 90% of pediatric patients for at least 7 days. There was no evidence of a dose response effect on uric acid control for doses between 0.15 and 0.20 mg/kg rasburicase. In preclinical in vivo studies, rasburicase did not affect the activity of isoenzymes CYP1A, CYP2A, CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP2E, and CYP3A, suggesting no induction or inhibition potential. Clinically relevant P450-mediated drug-drug interactions are therefore not anticipated in patients treated with the recommended Elitek dose and dosing schedule. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of rasburicase was evaluated in both pediatric and adult patients with leukemia, lymphoma or other hematological malignancies. Rasburicase exposure, as measured by AUC 0\u201324 hr and C max , tended to increase with a dose range from 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg. The mean terminal half-life was similar between pediatric and adult patients and ranged from 15.7 to 22.5 hours. The mean volume of distribution of rasburicase ranged from 110 to 127 mL/kg in pediatric patients and from 75.8 to 138 mL/kg in adult patients, respectively. Minimal accumulation of rasburicase (<1.3-fold) was observed between days 1 and 5 of dosing. In adults, age, gender, baseline liver enzymes and creatinine clearance did not impact the pharmacokinetics of rasburicase. A cross-study comparison revealed that after administration of rasburicase at 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg, the geometric mean values of body-weight normalized clearance were approximately 40% lower in Japanese (n=20) than that in Caucasians (n=22)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC"], "effective_time": "20250508", "product_ndc": ["0024-5150", "0024-5151"], "brand_name": ["Elitek"]}

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ponesimod is a S1P receptor 1 modulator that binds with high affinity to S1P receptor 1. Ponesimod blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes, reducing the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood. The mechanism by which ponesimod exerts therapeutic effects in MS is unknown, but may involve reduction of lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Immune System In healthy volunteers, PONVORY induces a dose-dependent reduction of the peripheral blood lymphocyte count from a single dose of 5 mg onwards, with the greatest reduction observed 6 hours post-dose, caused by reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. After 7 daily doses of 20 mg, the greatest decrease in absolute mean lymphocyte count was to 26% of baseline (650 cells/\u00b5L), observed 6 hours after administration. Peripheral blood B cells [CD19+] and T cells [CD3+], T-helper [CD3+CD4+], and T-cytotoxic [CD3+CD8+] cell subsets are all affected, while NK cells are not. T-helper cells were more sensitive to the effects of ponesimod than T-cytotoxic cells. PK/PD modeling indicates lymphocyte counts returned to the normal range in greater than 90% of healthy subjects within 1 to 2 weeks of stopping therapy. In Study 1, peripheral lymphocyte counts returned to the normal range within 2 weeks after discontinuation of PONVORY. Heart Rate and Rhythm PONVORY causes a transient dose-dependent reduction in heart rate and AV conduction delays upon treatment initiation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The heart rate decreases plateaued at doses greater than or equal to 40 mg [2 times the recommended maintenance dosage], and bradyarrhythmic events (AV blocks) were detected at a higher incidence under PONVORY treatment, compared to placebo. This effect starts within the first hour of dosing and is maximal at 2-4 hours post-dose. Heart rate generally returns to pre-dose values by 4-5 hours post-dose on Day 1, and the effect diminishes with repeated administration, indicating tolerance. The decrease in heart rate induced by ponesimod can be reversed by atropine. Beta-Blockers The negative chronotropic effect of coadministration of PONVORY and propranolol was evaluated in a dedicated pharmacodynamics safety study. The addition of PONVORY to propranolol at steady state has an additive effect on heart rate effect [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . Cardiac Electrophysiology In a thorough QT study, daily administration of ponesimod doses of 40 mg and 100 mg (respectively 2- and 5-fold the recommended maintenance dose) until steady-state conditions were achieved resulted in prolongation of Fridericia-corrected QT (QTcF) intervals, with the maximum mean (upper bound of 90% two-sided confidence interval) at 11.8 ms (40 mg) and 16.2 ms (100 mg). No subject had absolute QTcF greater than 480 ms or \u0394QTcF greater than 90 ms for ponesimod treatment. Pulmonary Function Dose-dependent reductions in FEV 1 and FVC were observed in PONVORY-treated subjects, and were greater than in subjects taking placebo [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . These effects can be reversed with administration of a short acting beta2 agonist. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following ponesimod oral dosing, C max and AUC increased approximately dose-proportionally in the dose-range studied (1-75 mg). Steady-state levels are approximately 2.0- to 2.6-fold greater than with a single dose, and are achieved following 3 days of administration of the maintenance dose of ponesimod. The pharmacokinetics of ponesimod are similar in healthy subjects and patients with MS, with 25% inter-subject variability across studies. Absorption The time to reach maximum plasma concentration of ponesimod is 2-4 hours post-dose. The absolute oral bioavailability of a 10 mg dose is 84%. Food Effect Food does not have a clinically relevant effect on ponesimod pharmacokinetics; therefore, PONVORY may be taken with or without food. Distribution Following IV administration in healthy subjects, the steady-state volume of distribution of ponesimod is 160 L. Ponesimod is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and is mainly (78.5%) distributed in the plasma fraction of whole blood. Animal studies show that ponesimod readily crosses the blood-brain-barrier. Metabolism Ponesimod is extensively metabolized prior to excretion in humans, though unchanged ponesimod was the main circulating component in plasma. Two inactive circulating metabolites, M12 and M13, have also been identified in human plasma. M13 and M12 are respectively about 20% and 6% of total drug-related exposure. Both metabolites are inactive at S1P receptors at concentrations achieved with recommended doses of ponesimod. Experiments with human liver preparations indicate that metabolism of ponesimod to M13 occurs primarily through a combination of non-Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymatic activities. Multiple CYP450 (CYP2J2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP4F3A, and CYP4F12) and non-CYP450 enzymes catalyze the oxidation of ponesimod to M12. Ponesimod also undergoes direct glucuronidation (mainly UGT1A1 and UGT2B7). Excretion After a single IV administration, the total clearance of ponesimod is 3.8 L/hour. The elimination half-life after oral administration is approximately 33 hours. Following a single oral administration of 14 C-ponesimod, 57% to 80% of the dose was recovered in feces (16% as unchanged ponesimod), and 10% to 18% in urine (no unchanged ponesimod). Specific Populations Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. In adult subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance [CrCl], as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault, between 30-59 mL/min for moderate and <30 mL/min for severe), there were no significant changes in ponesimod C max and AUC, compared to subjects with normal renal function (CrCl>90 mL/min). The effect of dialysis on the PK of ponesimod has not been studied. Due to the high plasma protein binding (greater than 99%) of ponesimod, dialysis is not expected to alter the total and unbound ponesimod concentration, and no dose adjustments are anticipated based on these considerations. Hepatic Impairment In adult subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, B and C, respectively), no change in ponesimod C max was observed, but ponesimod AUC 0-\u221e was increased by 1.3-, 2.0-, and 3.1-fold, respectively, compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Age Age (range: 17 to 65 years) was not identified to significantly influence the PK of ponesimod in population pharmacokinetics analyses. The effect of age (65 years of age and older) on the pharmacokinetics of ponesimod is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Gender Gender has no clinically significant influence on ponesimod pharmacokinetics. Race No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences were observed between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Beta-Blockers In a drug-drug interaction study, the dose titration regimen of ponesimod [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] was administered to subjects receiving propranolol (80 mg) once daily at steady state. No significant changes in pharmacokinetics of ponesimod or propranolol were observed. Compared to ponesimod alone, the combination of propranolol and the first dose of ponesimod (2 mg) led to a mean hourly heart rate decrease of 12.4 bpm (90% CI: -15.6 to -9.1). Compared to ponesimod alone, propranolol administered in combination with the first maintenance dose of ponesimod (20 mg) led to a 7.4 bpm (90% CI: -10.9 to -3.9) mean hourly heart rate decrease. Effect of Other Drugs on Ponesimod In vitro studies with human liver preparations indicate that metabolism of ponesimod occurs through multiple distinct enzyme systems, including multiple CYP450 (CYP2J2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP4F3A, and CYP4F12), UGT (mainly UGT1A1 and UGT2B7), and non-CYP450 oxidative enzymes, without major contribution by any single enzyme. Ponesimod is not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3 transporters. Drugs that are inhibitors of these transporters are unlikely to impact the PK of ponesimod. Coadministration of carbamazepine 300 mg twice daily (a strong CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inducer) at steady-state decreased ponesimod C max by 20% and AUC by 26%, which is not considered to be clinically significant. Effect of Ponesimod on Other Drugs In vitro investigations indicate that at the recommended dose of 20 mg once-daily, ponesimod and its metabolite M13 do not show any clinically relevant drug-drug interaction potential for CYP or UGT enzymes, or transporters. Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of ponesimod with an oral hormonal contraceptive (containing 1 mg norethisterone/norethindrone and 35 \u03bcg ethinyl estradiol) showed no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction with ponesimod. Therefore, concomitant use of ponesimod is not expected to decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. No interaction studies have been performed with oral contraceptives containing other progestogens; however, an effect of ponesimod on their exposure is not expected."], "manufacturer_name": ["Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "effective_time": "20241030", "product_ndc": ["43068-610", "43068-620"], "brand_name": ["PONVORY"]}

The progestin in Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest is dienogest (DNG). DNG displays properties of 19-nortestosterone derivatives as well as properties associated with progesterone derivatives. [See Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 ).] Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest on QT prolongation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, positive (moxifloxacin 400 mg) and negative (placebo) controlled crossover study in healthy subjects. A total of 53 subjects were administered Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest (containing 3 mg dienogest and 2 mg estradiol valerate), dienogest 10 mg, and placebo as once daily doses for 4 days, and moxifloxacin 400 mg as a single oral dose. The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on Fridericia\u2019s correction method (QTcF) was below 10 msec, the threshold for regulatory concern. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of estradiol valerate, cleavage to 17\u03b2-estradiol and valeric acid takes place during absorption by the intestinal mucosa or in the course of the first liver passage. This gives rise to estradiol and its metabolites, estrone and other metabolites. Maximum serum estradiol concentrations of 73.3 pg/mL are reached at a median of approximately 6 hours (range: 1.5\u201312 hours) and the area under the estradiol concentration curve [AUC(0\u201324hr)] was 1301 pg\u00b7hr/mL after single ingestion of a tablet containing 3 mg estradiol valerate under fasted condition on Day 1 of the 28-day sequential regimen. Bioavailability of dienogest is about 91%. Maximum serum dienogest concentrations of 91.7 ng/mL are reached at a median of approximately 1 hour (range: 0.5\u20131.5 hour) and the area under the dienogest concentration curve [AUC(0\u201324hr)] was 964 ng/mL after single oral administration of Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest tablet containing 2 mg estradiol valerate/3 mg dienogest under fasted condition. The pharmacokinetics of dienogest are dose-proportional within the dose range of 1\u20138 mg. Steady state is reached after 4 days of the same dosage of 2 mg dienogest. The mean accumulation ratio for AUC (0\u201324hr) is approximately 1.24. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state following repeated oral doses of a 2 mg estradiol valerate/3 mg dienogest combination tablet in fertile women under fasted condition are reported in Table 1.

Distribution In serum, 38% of estradiol is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), 60% to albumin and 2\u20133% circulates in free form. An apparent volume of distribution of approximately 1.2 L/kg was determined after intravenous (IV) administration. A relatively high fraction (10%) of circulating dienogest is present in the free form, with approximately 90% being bound non-specifically to albumin. Dienogest does not bind to SHBG and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG). The volume of distribution at steady state (V d,ss ) of dienogest is 46 L after the IV administration of 85 mcg 3 H-dienogest. Metabolism After oral administration of estradiol valerate, approximately 3% of the dose is directly bioavailable as estradiol. Estradiol undergoes an extensive first-pass effect and a considerable part of the dose administered is already metabolized in the gastrointestinal mucosa. The CYP 3A family is known to play the most important role in human estradiol metabolism. Together with the pre-systemic metabolism in the liver, about 95% of the orally administered dose becomes metabolized before entering the systemic circulation. The main metabolites are estrone and its sulfate or glucuronide conjugates. Dienogest is extensively metabolized by the known pathways of steroid metabolism (hydroxylation, conjugation), with the formation of endocrinologically mostly inactive metabolites. CYP3A4 was identified as a predominant enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of dienogest. Excretion Estradiol and its metabolites are mainly excreted in urine, with about 10% being excreted in the feces. The terminal half-life of estradiol is approximately 14 hours. Dienogest is mainly excreted renally in the form of metabolites and unchanged dienogest is the dominating fraction in plasma. The terminal half-life of dienogest is approximately 11 hours.

Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when moderate or weak enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Dienogest is a substrate of CYP3A4. Women who take medications that are strong CYP3A4 inducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John\u2019s wort) should not choose Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest as their oral contraceptive while using these inducers and for at least 28 days after discontinuation of these inducers due to the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy. The effect of the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin was studied in an open-label, non-randomized, single center study in 16 healthy postmenopausal women. All volunteers received a treatment regimen of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 3 mg dienogest combination tablets, dosed once daily over 17 days, and of rifampicin, which was administered once daily in an oral dose of 600 mg on Days 12 to 16. 24\u2013hr pharmacokinetics of estradiol and dienogest on Days 11 and 17 were compared. Co-administration of rifampicin with estradiol valerate/dienogest tablets led to a 52 % and 83% decrease in the mean Cmax and AUC(0\u201324hr), respectively, for dienogest and a 25% and 44% decrease in Cmax and AUC(0\u201324hr), respectively, for estradiol at steady state. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole increase hormone serum concentrations. The effect of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, on dienogest and estradiol pharmacokinetics was studied in an open-label, two parallel-groups, one-sequence, one-way crossover study in healthy postmenopausal Caucasian women. One tablet of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 3 mg dienogest was administered orally once a day for 14 days. Twelve volunteers received an oral dose of 400 mg ketoconazole (that is, 2 tablets containing 200 mg ketoconazole) once daily for 7 days (Days 8\u201314). Twenty-four hour pharmacokinetics of estradiol and dienogest on Days 7 and 14 were compared. Co-administration with the strong inhibitor ketoconazole resulted in a 186% and 57% increase of AUC (0\u201324hr) at steady state for dienogest and estradiol. There was also a 94% and 65% increase of Cmax at steady state for dienogest and estradiol when co-administered with ketoconazole. Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin increase hormone serum concentrations. The effect of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, erythromycin on dienogest and estradiol pharmacokinetics was studied in an open-label, two parallel-groups, one-sequence, one-way crossover study in healthy postmenopausal Caucasian women. One tablet of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 3 mg dienogest was administered orally once a day for 14 days. Twelve volunteers received an oral dose of 500 mg erythromycin three times a day for 7 days (Days 8\u201314). Twenty-four hour pharmacokinetics of estradiol and dienogest on Days 7 and 14 were compared. When co-administered with the moderate inhibitor erythromycin, the AUC (0\u201324hr) of dienogest and estradiol at steady state were increased by 62% and 33%, respectively. There was also a 33% and 51% increase of Cmax at steady state for dienogest and estradiol when co-administered with erythromycin. Other known CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals, cimetidine, verapamil, macrolides, diltiazem, antidepressants, and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of dienogest and estradiol. HIV/HCV Protease Inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro studies with human CYP enzymes did not indicate an inhibitory potential of dienogest at clinically relevant concentrations. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs."], "manufacturer_name": ["Sandoz Inc"], "effective_time": "20200121", "product_ndc": ["0781-4110"], "brand_name": ["Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest"]}

Chemical structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Vonoprazan suppresses basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell through inhibition of the H + , K + -ATPase enzyme system in a potassium competitive manner. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, vonoprazan has been characterized as a type of gastric proton-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. Vonoprazan does not require activation by acid. Vonoprazan may selectively concentrate in the parietal cells in both the resting and stimulated states. Vonoprazan binds to the active proton pumps in a noncovalent and reversible manner. Amoxicillin is an antibacterial drug. Clarithromycin is a macrolide antimicrobial drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. Acid suppression enhances the replication of H. pylori bacteria and the stability and effectiveness of antimicrobials in the treatment of H. pylori infection. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vonoprazan Antisecretory Activity Following a single 20 mg dose of vonoprazan, the onset of the antisecretory effect as measured by intragastric pH occurs within 2 to 3 hours. The elevated intragastric pH compared to placebo is maintained for over 24-hours after dosing. The inhibitory effect of vonoprazan on acid secretion increases with repeated daily dosing and antisecretory effect reached steady state by Day 4 with a mean (SD) 24-hour intragastric pH of 6.0 (1.5) following 20 mg once daily dose (not an approved recommended dosage). The antisecretory effect of vonoprazan decreases following drug discontinuation although intragastric pH remained elevated compared to placebo for 24 to 48 hours following the dose on Day 7. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 6 times the maximum recommended dose, vonoprazan does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. Serum Gastrin Effects In clinical trials conducted in adult patients with erosive esophagitis, treatment with vonoprazan increased baseline serum gastrin concentrations. Mean gastrin levels remained elevated with the recommended daily dose of vonoprazan for the treatment of erosive esophagitis and the mean serum gastrin levels returned to normal within 4 weeks of discontinuation of treatment. Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum CgA levels. The increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for vonoprazan 20 mg after a single dose (not an approved recommended dosage) and at steady state following twice daily administration are summarized in Table 8. Table 8: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Vonoprazan Following a Single Dose or at Steady State Following Twice Daily Dosing PK Parameter Single Dose (N=10) Steady State (N=32) C max = Maximum plasma concentration; AUC 0-12h = Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the end of the 12-hour dosing interval; T max = Time to reach C max ; t 1/2 = Elimination half-life, CL/F = Apparent oral clearance, V z /F = Apparent oral volume of distribution. T max (h), median (range) 2.5 (1.0-4.0) 3.0 (1.0-6.0) C max (ng/mL) 25.2 (39.7) 37.8 (36.1) AUC 0-12h (ng*hr/mL) 154.8 (25.2) 272.5 (30.5) t 1/2 (h) 7.1 (10.1) 6.8 (22.7) CL/F (L/h) 97.3 (36.3) 81.3 (35.7) V z /F (L) 1001 (39.6) 782.7 (34.4) Vonoprazan Absorption Vonoprazan exhibits time independent pharmacokinetics and steady state concentrations are achieved by Day 3 to 4. After multiple doses of vonoprazan ranging from 10 mg (0.5 times the lowest approved recommended single dosage) to 40 mg (2 times the highest approved recommended single dosage) once daily for 7 days in healthy subjects, C max and AUC values for vonoprazan increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner. Steady state mean plasma exposure of vonoprazan following 20 mg twice daily dosing (AUC 0-12h = 273 hr*ng/mL, N=10) was approximately 1.8-fold higher compared to Day 1 (AUC 0-12h = 155 hr*ng/mL, N=10). Effect of Food: In a food effect study in healthy subjects (N=24) receiving vonoprazan 20 mg, a high-fat meal resulted in a 5% increase in C max , a 15% increase in AUC, and a delay in median T max of 2 hours. These changes are not considered to be clinically significant. Distribution Plasma protein binding of vonoprazan ranged from 85 to 88% in healthy subjects and was independent of concentration from 0.1 to 10 mcg/mL. Elimination Metabolism: Vonoprazan is metabolized to inactive metabolites via multiple pathways by a combination of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms (predominantly CYP3A4/5, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2B6) along with sulfo- and glucuronosyl-transferases. CYP2C19 polymorphisms have been evaluated in clinical studies and there were no considerable differences in the pharmacokinetics of vonoprazan based on CYP2C19 metabolizer status. Excretion: Following oral administration of radiolabeled vonoprazan, approximately 67% of the radiolabeled dose (8% as unchanged vonoprazan) was recovered in urine and 31% (1.4% as unchanged vonoprazan) was recovered in feces. Specific Populations Sex, Race or Ethnicity: There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of vonoprazan based on sex or race/ethnicity. Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of vonoprazan administered as a single 20 mg dose in patients with mild (N=8), moderate (N=8), or severe (N=8) renal impairment were compared to those with normal renal function (N=13). Compared to subjects with normal renal function, systemic exposure (AUC \u221e ) was 1.7-, 1.3-, and 2.4-times greater in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In subjects requiring dialysis (N=8), AUC \u221e estimates were 1.3-fold greater compared to estimates from subjects with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Protein binding of vonoprazan is not affected by impaired renal function. In patients requiring dialysis, vonoprazan was present in the dialysate and represented 0.94% of the dose administered . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of vonoprazan administered as a single 20 mg dose in patients with mild [Child-Pugh Class A (N=8)], moderate [Child-Pugh Class B (N=8)], or severe [Child-Pugh Class C (N=6)] hepatic impairment were compared to those with normal hepatic function (N=12). Compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, systemic exposure (AUC \u221e ) of vonoprazan was 1.2-, 2.4-, and 2.6-times greater in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Protein binding of vonoprazan is not affected by impaired hepatic function . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies: Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) Enzymes : In vitro studies have shown that vonoprazan directly and time-dependently inhibits CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5. Transporter Systems : Vonoprazan inhibits multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1) and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), but only at concentrations higher than clinically relevant. Clinical Studies: Combination Therapy with Vonoprazan, Amoxicillin, and Clarithromycin : When vonoprazan 20 mg, amoxicillin 750 mg, and clarithromycin 400 mg were co-administered twice daily for 7 days (N=11), there was no effect on pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin compared to administration of amoxicillin alone. However, vonoprazan C max and AUC 0-12h increased by 87% and 85%, respectively, and clarithromycin, C max and AUC 0-12h increased by 64% and 45%, respectively, compared to administration of each component alone. Effect of Vonoprazan on CYP3A4 Substrates : When a single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg was administered following vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily for 7 days (N=20), midazolam AUC \u221e increased 93% compared to administration of midazolam alone. Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Vonoprazan : When a single 40 mg (2 times the highest approved recommended single dosage) dose of vonoprazan was administered with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 7 days (N=16), vonoprazan AUC \u221e increased 58% compared to administration of vonoprazan alone. Model-Informed Approaches: Effect of CYP3A Inducers on Vonoprazan : Vonoprazan exposures are predicted to be 80% lower when co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampicin and 50% lower when co-administered with a moderate CYP3A4 inducer such as efavirenz. Amoxicillin Absorption Amoxicillin is stable in the presence of gastric acid and is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Orally administered doses of 500-mg amoxicillin capsules result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 5.5 mcg/mL to 7.5 mcg/mL, respectively. Distribution Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids, with the exception of brain and spinal fluid, except when meninges are inflamed. In blood serum, amoxicillin is approximately 20% protein-bound. Following a 1-gram dose and utilizing a special skin window technique to determine levels of the antibacterial, it was noted that therapeutic levels were found in the interstitial fluid. Metabolism and Excretion The half-life of amoxicillin is 61.3 minutes. Approximately 60% of an orally administered dose of amoxicillin is excreted in the urine within 6 to 8 hours. Detectable serum levels are observed up to 8 hours after an orally administered dose of amoxicillin. Since most of the amoxicillin is excreted unchanged in the urine, its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid. Clarithromycin Absorption For a single 500 mg dose of clarithromycin, food slightly delays the onset of clarithromycin absorption, increasing the peak time from approximately 2 to 2.5 hours. Food also increases the clarithromycin peak plasma concentration by about 24%, but does not affect the extent of clarithromycin bioavailability. Food does not affect the onset of formation of the active metabolite, 14-OH clarithromycin or its peak plasma concentration but does slightly decrease the extent of metabolite formation, indicated by an 11% decrease in AUC. Therefore, clarithromycin may be given without regard to food. In non-fasting healthy human subjects (males and females), peak plasma concentrations were attained within 2 to 3 hours after oral dosing. Distribution Clarithromycin and the 14-OH clarithromycin metabolite distribute readily into body tissues and fluids. There are no data available on cerebrospinal fluid penetration. Because of high intracellular concentrations, tissue concentrations are higher than serum concentrations. Metabolism and Elimination Steady-state peak plasma clarithromycin concentrations were attained within 3 days and were 3 mcg/mL to 4 mcg/mL with a 500 mg dose administered every 8 hours to 12 hours. The elimination half-life of clarithromycin was 5 hours to 7 hours with 500 mg administered every 8 hours to 12 hours. The nonlinearity of clarithromycin pharmacokinetics is slight at the recommended doses of 500 mg administered every 8 hours to 12 hours. With a 500 mg every 8 hours to 12 hours dosing, the peak steady-state concentration of 14-OH clarithromycin is slightly higher (up to 1 mcg/mL), and its elimination half-life is about 7 hours to 9 hours. With any of these dosing regimens, the steady-state concentration of this metabolite is generally attained within 3 days to 4 days. After a 500 mg tablet every 12 hours, the urinary excretion of clarithromycin is approximately 30%. The renal clearance of clarithromycin is, however, relatively independent of the dose size and approximates the normal glomerular filtration rate. The major metabolite found in urine is 14-OH clarithromycin, which accounts for an additional 10% to 15% of the dose with a 500 mg tablet administered every 12 hours. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The steady-state concentrations of clarithromycin in subjects with impaired hepatic function did not differ from those in normal subjects; however, the 14-OH clarithromycin concentrations were lower in the hepatically impaired subjects. The decreased formation of 14-OH clarithromycin was at least partially offset by an increase in renal clearance of clarithromycin in the subjects with impaired hepatic function when compared to healthy subjects. Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin were also altered in subjects with impaired renal function. Drug Interaction Studies Fluconazole: Following administration of fluconazole 200 mg daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily to 21 healthy volunteers, the steady-state clarithromycin C min and AUC increased 33% and 18%, respectively. Clarithromycin exposures were increased and steady-state concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin were not significantly affected by concomitant administration of fluconazole. Colchicine: When a single dose of colchicine 0.6 mg was administered with clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily for 7 days, the colchicine C max increased 197% and the AUC 0-\u221e increased 239% compared to administration of colchicine alone. Atazanavir: Following administration of clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (400 mg once daily), the clarithromycin AUC increased 94%, the 14-OH clarithromycin AUC decreased 70%, and the atazanavir AUC increased 28%. Ritonavir: Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and ritonavir (N=22) resulted in a 77% increase in clarithromycin AUC and a 100% decrease in the AUC of 14-OH clarithromycin. Saquinavir: Following administration of clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) and saquinavir (soft gelatin capsules, 1200 mg tid) to 12 healthy volunteers, the steady-state saquinavir AUC and C max increased 177% and 187% respectively compared to administration of saquinavir alone. Clarithromycin AUC and C max increased 45% and 39% respectively, whereas the 14-OH clarithromycin AUC and C max decreased 24% and 34% respectively, compared to administration with clarithromycin alone. Didanosine: Simultaneous administration of clarithromycin tablets and didanosine to 12 HIV-infected adult patients resulted in no statistically significant change in didanosine pharmacokinetics. Zidovudine: Following administration of clarithromycin 500 mg tablets twice daily with zidovudine 100 mg every 4 hours, the steady-state zidovudine AUC decreased 12% compared to administration of zidovudine alone (N=4). Individual values ranged from a decrease of 34% to an increase of 14%. When clarithromycin tablets were administered two to four hours prior to zidovudine, the steady-state zidovudine C max increased 100% whereas the AUC was unaffected (N=24). Omeprazole: Clarithromycin 500 mg every 8 hours was given in combination with omeprazole 40 mg daily to healthy adult subjects. The steady-state plasma concentrations of omeprazole were increased (C max , AUC 0-24 , and t \u00bd increases of 30%, 89%, and 34%, respectively), by the concomitant administration of clarithromycin. The plasma levels of clarithromycin and 14-OH clarithromycin were increased by the concomitant administration of omeprazole. For clarithromycin, the mean C max was 10% greater, the mean C min was 27% greater, and the mean AUC 0-8 was 15% greater when clarithromycin was administered with omeprazole than when clarithromycin was administered alone. Similar results were seen for 14-OH clarithromycin, the mean C max was 45% greater, the mean C min was 57% greater, and the mean AUC 0-8 was 45% greater. Clarithromycin concentrations in the gastric tissue and mucus were also increased by concomitant administration of omeprazole.

Midazolam: When a single dose of midazolam was co-administered with clarithromycin tablets (500 mg twice daily for 7 days), midazolam AUC increased 174% after intravenous administration of midazolam and 600% after oral administration. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Amoxicillin is similar to penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria. Clarithromycin exerts its antibacterial activity by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis. Resistance Resistance to amoxicillin is mediated primarily through enzymes called beta-lactamases that cleave the beta-lactam ring of amoxicillin, rendering it inactive. The major routes of clarithromycin resistance are modification of the 23S rRNA in the 50S ribosomal subunit to insensitivity or drug efflux pumps. Beta-lactamase production should have no effect on clarithromycin activity. If H. pylori is not eradicated after treatment with clarithromycin-containing combination regimens, patients may develop clarithromycin resistance in H. pylori isolates. Therefore, for patients who fail therapy, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be done, if possible. Antimicrobial Activity Culture and sensitivity testing of bacteria are not routinely performed to establish the diagnosis of H. pylori infection [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin are active in vitro against most isolates of H. pylori . Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC.

Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Synthetic analogs such as triamcinolone are primarily used for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension has an extended duration of effect which may be sustained over a period of several weeks. Studies indicate that following a single intramuscular dose of 60 mg to 100 mg of triamcinolone acetonide, adrenal suppression occurs within 24 to 48 hours and then gradually returns to normal, usually in 30 to 40 days. This finding correlates closely with the extended duration of therapeutic action achieved with the drug.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine HCl stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine HCl is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine HCl is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine HCl is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine HCl crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine HCl is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine HCl. Approximately 90% of lidocaine HCl administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine HCl following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine HCl is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine HCl kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine HCl kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine HCl required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity."], "purpose": ["Purpose Antiseptic"], "manufacturer_name": ["Asclemed USA, Inc."], "effective_time": "20241005", "product_ndc": ["76420-624"], "brand_name": ["Physician EZ Use Joint Tunnel and Trigger Kit II"]}

The estrogen in OCELLA is ethinyl estradiol (EE). No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with OCELLA. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of DRSP from a single entity tablet is about 76%. The absolute bioavailability of EE is approximately 40% as a result of presystemic conjugation and first-pass metabolism. The absolute bioavailability of OCELLA, which is a combination tablet of DRSP and EE, has not been evaluated. Serum concentrations of DRSP and EE reached peak levels within 1-2 hours after administration of OCELLA. The pharmacokinetics of DRSP are dose proportional following single doses ranging from 1-10 mg. Following daily dosing of OCELLA, steady state DRSP concentrations were observed after 8 days. There was about 2 to 3 fold accumulation in serum C max and AUC (0-24h) values of DRSP following multiple dose administration of OCELLA (see Table 3). For EE, steady-state conditions are reported during the second half of a treatment cycle. Following daily administration of OCELLA serum C max and AUC (0-24h) values of EE accumulate by a factor of about 1.5 to 2 (see Table 3).

The extent of absorption of DRSP, however, remained unchanged. In contrast, the extent of absorption of EE was reduced by about 20% under fed conditions. Distribution DRSP and EE serum concentrations decline in two phases. The apparent volume of distribution of DRSP is approximately 4 L/kg and that of EE is reported to be approximately 4\u20135 L/kg. DRSP does not bind to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) or corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) but binds about 97% to other serum proteins. Multiple dosing over 3 cycles resulted in no change in the free fraction (as measured at trough concentrations). EE is reported to be highly but non-specifically bound to serum albumin (approximately 98.5 %) and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of both SHBG and CBG. EE induced effects on SHBG and CBG were not affected by variation of the DRSP dosage in the range of 2 to 3 mg. Metabolism The two main metabolites of DRSP found in human plasma were identified to be the acid form of DRSP generated by opening of the lactone ring and the 4,5-dihydrodrospirenone-3-sulfate, formed by reduction and subsequent sulfation. These metabolites were shown not to be pharmacologically active. Drospirenone is also subject to oxidative metabolism catalyzed by CYP3A4. EE has been reported to be subject to significant gut and the hepatic first-pass metabolism. Metabolism of EE and its oxidative metabolites occur primarily by conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. CYP3A4 in the liver is responsible for the 2-hydroxylation which is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion. Excretion DRSP serum concentrations are characterized by a terminal disposition phase half-life of approximately 30 hours after both single and multiple dose regimens. Excretion of DRSP was nearly complete after ten days and amounts excreted were slightly higher in feces compared to urine. DRSP was extensively metabolized and only trace amounts of unchanged DRSP were excreted in urine and feces. At least 20 different metabolites were observed in urine and feces. About 38-47% of the metabolites in urine were glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In feces, about 17-20% of the metabolites were excreted as glucuronides and sulfates. For EE the terminal disposition phase half-life has been reported to be approximately 24 hours. EE is not excreted unchanged. EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy of OCELLA has been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated. Geriatric Use: OCELLA has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population. Race: No clinically significant difference was observed between the pharmacokinetics of DRSP or EE in Japanese versus Caucasian women (age 25-35) when 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE was administered daily for 21 days. Other ethnic groups have not been specifically studied. Renal Impairment: OCELLA is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of DRSP (3 mg daily for 14 days) and the effect of DRSP on serum potassium concentrations were investigated in three separate groups of female subjects (n=28, age 30-65). All subjects were on a low potassium diet. During the study, 7 subjects continued the use of potassium-sparing drugs for the treatment of their underlying illness. On the 14th day (steady-state) of DRSP treatment, the serum DRSP concentrations in the group with CLcr of 50\u201379 mL/min were comparable to those in the control group with CLcr \u2265 80 mL/min. The serum DRSP concentrations were on average 37% higher in the group with CLcr of 30\u201349 mL/min compared to those in the control group. DRSP treatment did not show any clinically significant effect on serum potassium concentration. Although hyperkalemia was not observed in the study, in five of the seven subjects who continued use of potassium sparing drugs during the study, mean serum potassium concentrations increased by up to 0.33 mEq/L. [See Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ).] Hepatic Impairment: OCELLA is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease. The mean exposure to DRSP in women with moderate liver impairment is approximately three times higher than the exposure in women with normal liver function. OCELLA has not been studied in women with severe hepatic impairment. [See Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ).] Drug Interactions Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with oral contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in 20 premenopausal women, co-administration of a DRSP (3 mg)/EE (0.02 mg) COC with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) for 10 days increased the AUC(0-24h) of DRSP and EE by 2.68-fold (90% CI: 2.44, 2.95) and 1.40-fold (90% CI: 1.31, 1.49), respectively. The increases in C max were 1.97-fold (90% CI: 1.79, 2.17) and 1.39-fold (90% CI: 1.28, 1.52) for DRSP and EE, respectively. Although no clinically relevant effects on safety or laboratory parameters including serum potassium were observed, this study only assessed subjects for 10 days. The clinical impact for a patient taking a DRSP-containing COC concomitantly with chronic use of a CYP3A4/5 inhibitor is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . HIV/HCV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro , EE is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 as well as a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8, and CYP2J2. Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic CYP enzymes have been investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies. In in vitro studies DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women [including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype] the daily oral administration of 3 mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the oral clearance of omeprazole (40 mg, single oral dose) and the CYP2C19 product 5-hydroxy omeprazole. Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found. These results demonstrate that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in vivo . Two additional clinical drug-drug interaction studies using simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrates for CYP3A4 were each performed in 24 healthy postmenopausal women. The results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steady state DRSP concentrations achieved after administration of 3 mg DRSP/day. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Interactions With Drugs That Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking OCELLA with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . A drug-drug interaction study of DRSP 3 mg/estradiol (E2) 1 mg versus placebo was performed in 24 mildly hypertensive postmenopausal women taking enalapril maleate 10 mg twice daily. Potassium concentrations were obtained every other day for a total of 2 weeks in all subjects. Mean serum potassium concentrations in the DRSP/E2 treatment group relative to baseline were 0.22 mEq/L higher than those in the placebo group. Serum potassium concentrations also were measured at multiple time points over 24 hours at baseline and on Day 14. On Day 14, the ratios for serum potassium Cmax and AUC in the DRSP/E2 group to those in the placebo group were 0.955 (90% CI: 0.914, 0.999) and 1.010 (90% CI: 0.944, 1.08), respectively. No patient in either treatment group developed hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentrations >5.5 mEq/L)."], "manufacturer_name": ["TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC."], "effective_time": "20230519", "product_ndc": ["0555-9131"], "brand_name": ["OCELLA"]}

Ethinyl estradiol is about 95 - 97% bound to serum albumin. Ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis, which leads to decreased levonorgestrel clearance. Following repeated daily dosing of levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel plasma concentrations accumulate more than predicted based on single-dose pharmacokinetics, due in part, to increased SHBG levels that are induced by ethinyl estradiol, and a possible reduction in hepatic metabolic capacity. Metabolism Following absorption, levonorgestrel is conjugated at the 17\u03b2-OH position to form sulfate and to a lesser extent, glucuronide conjugates in plasma. Significant amounts of conjugated and unconjugated 3\u03b1,5\u03b2-tetrahydrolevonorgestrel are also present in plasma, along with much smaller amounts of 3\u03b1,5\u03b1-tetrahydrolevonorgestrel and 16\u03b2-hydroxylevonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel and its phase I metabolites are excreted primarily as glucuronide conjugates. Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several-fold, and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users. First-pass metabolism of ethinyl estradiol involves formation of ethinyl estradiol-3-sulfate in the gut wall, followed by 2-hydroxylation of a portion of the remaining untransformed ethinyl estradiol by hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Levels of CYP3A4 vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of ethinyl estradiol hydroxylation. Hydroxylation at the 4-, 6-, and 16- positions may also occur, although to a much lesser extent than 2-hydroxylation. The various hydroxylated metabolites are subject to further methylation and/or conjugation. Excretion About 45% of levonorgestrel and its metabolites are excreted in the urine and about 32% are excreted in feces, mostly as glucuronide conjugates. The terminal elimination half-life for levonorgestrel after a single dose of CAMRESE was about 34 hours. Ethinyl estradiol is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, and it undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. The terminal elimination half-life of ethinyl estradiol after a single dose of CAMRESE was found to be about 18 hours.

{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE Volnea\u2122 (desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol) tablets are indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect to use this product as a method of contraception. Oral contraceptives are highly effective. Table 2 lists the typical accidental pregnancy rates for users of combination oral contraceptives and other methods of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive methods, except sterilization, depends upon the reliability with which they are used. Correct and consistent use of these methods can result in lower failure rates. TABLE 2 Percentage of women experiencing an unintended pregnancy during the first year of typical use and the first year of perfect use of contraception and the percentage continuing use at the end of the first year, United States. % of Women Experiencing an Unintended Pregnancy within the First Year of Use % of Women Continuing Use at One Year Among couples attempting to avoid pregnancy, the percentage who continue to use a method for one year. Method (1) Typical Use Among typical couples who initiate use of a method (not necessarily for the first time), the percentage who experience an accidental pregnancy during the first year if they do not stop use for any other reason. (2) Perfect Use Among couples who initiate use of a method (not necessarily for the first time) and who use it perfectly (both consistently and correctly), the percentage who experience an accidental pregnancy during the first year if they do not stop use for any other reason. (3) (4) Chance The percents becoming pregnant in columns (2) and (3) are based on data from populations where contraception is not used and from women who cease using contraception in order to become pregnant. Among such populations, about 89% become pregnant within one year.

Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation). Receptor binding studies, as well as studies in animals, have shown that etonogestrel, the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel, combines high progestational activity with minimal intrinsic androgenicity (91, 92). The relevance of this latter finding in humans is unknown. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Desogestrel is rapidly and almost completely absorbed and converted into etonogestrel, its biologically active metabolite. Following oral administration, the relative bioavailability of desogestrel compared to a solution, as measured by serum levels of etonogestrel, is approximately 100%. Desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol tablets provide two different regimens of ethinyl estradiol; 0.02 mg in the combination tablet [white] as well as 0.01 mg in the yellow tablet. Ethinyl estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. After a single dose of desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol combination tablet [white], the relative bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol is approximately 93% while the relative bioavailability of the 0.01 mg tablet [yellow] is 99%. The effect of food on the bioavailability of desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol tablets following oral administration has not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetics of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol following multiple dose administration of desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol tablets were determined during the third cycle in 17 subjects. Plasma concentrations of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol reached steady-state by Day 21. The AUC (0\u201324) for etonogestrel at steady-state on Day 21 was approximately 2.2 times higher than AUC (0\u201324) on Day 1 of the third cycle. The pharmacokinetic parameters of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol during the third cycle following multiple dose administration of desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol tablets are summarized in Table 1.

Ethinyl estradiol is approximately 98.3% bound, mainly to plasma albumin. Ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis. Desogestrel, in combination with ethinyl estradiol, does not counteract the estrogen-induced increase in SHBG, resulting in lower serum levels of free testosterone (96 to 99). Metabolism Desogestrel Desogestrel is rapidly and completely metabolized by hydroxylation in the intestinal mucosa and on first pass through the liver to etonogestrel. Other metabolites (i.e., 3\u03b1-OH-desogestrel, 3\u03b2-OH-desogestrel, and 3\u03b1-OH-5\u03b1-H-desogestrel) with no pharmacologic actions also have been identified and these metabolites may undergo glucuronide and sulfate conjugation. Ethinyl estradiol Ethinyl estradiol is subject to a significant degree of presystemic conjugation (phase II metabolism). Ethinyl estradiol escaping gut wall conjugation undergoes phase I metabolism and hepatic conjugation (phase II metabolism). Major phase I metabolites are 2-OH-ethinyl estradiol and 2-methoxy-ethinyl estradiol. Sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of both ethinyl estradiol and phase I metabolites, which are excreted in bile, can undergo enterohepatic circulation. Excretion Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol are excreted in urine, bile, and feces. At steady state, on Day 21, the elimination half-life of etonogestrel is 27.8\u00b17.2 hours and the elimination half-life of ethinyl estradiol for the combination tablet is 23.9\u00b125.5 hours. For the 0.01 mg ethinyl estradiol tablet [yellow], the elimination half-life at steady state, Day 28, is 18.9\u00b18.3 hours.

After reconstitution, the solution appears as a clear and colorless to slightly yellow liquid, free from visible particles and contains the following excipients per mL: sodium chloride, 2.34 mg; histidine, 3.10 mg; sucrose, 10 mg; mannitol, 25 mg; polysorbate 80, 0.05 mg. REBINYN is available in single-dose vials containing the labeled amount of Factor IX activity, expressed in IU. Each vial contains nominally 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000, or 3000 IU. REBINYN potency is assigned using an in vitro , activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based, one-stage clotting assay calibrated against the World Health Organization (WHO) international standard for Factor IX concentrates. REBINYN contains no preservatives. REBINYN is a purified recombinant human Factor IX (rFIX) with a 40 kilodalton (kDa) polyethylene-glycol (PEG) conjugated to the protein. The 40 kDa PEG group is selectively attached to specific -N-linked glycans in the rFIX activation peptide, with mono-PEGylated rFIX as the predominant form of REBINYN. The rFIX protein in REBINYN consists of a gamma-carboxylated (Gla) domain, two EGF-like (epidermal growth factor) domains, an activation peptide (which is cleaved off upon activation), and a protease domain. Once activated, the resulting rFIX has structural and functional properties similar to those of endogenous activated Factor IX. The primary amino acid sequence in REBINYN is identical to the Thr148 allelic form of human plasma-derived Factor IX and consists of 415 amino acids. The average molecular weight of REBINYN is approximately 98 kDa and the molecular weight of the protein moiety alone is 56 kDa. The nominal specific activity of REBINYN is 144 IU/mg protein. REBINYN is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. No additives of human or animal origin are used in the cell culture, purification, conjugation, or formulation of REBINYN. The rFIX protein is purified by a series of chromatographic steps, including an affinity chromatography step using a monoclonal antibody (produced in CHO cells), to selectively isolate rFIX from the cell culture medium. The production process includes two dedicated viral clearance steps, namely a detergent treatment step for inactivation and a 20 nm filtration step for removal of viruses.

The estrogen in drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets is ethinyl estradiol. Contraception Two studies evaluated the effect of 3 mg DRSP / 0.02 mg EE combinations on the suppression of ovarian activity as assessed by measurement of follicle size via transvaginal ultrasound and serum hormone (progesterone and estradiol) analyses during two treatment cycles (21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period). More than 90% of subjects in these studies demonstrated ovulation inhibition. One study compared the effect of 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE combinations with two different regimens (24-day active tablet period plus 4-day pill-free period vs. 21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period) on the suppression of ovarian activity during two treatment cycles. During the first treatment cycle, there were no subjects (0/49, 0%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 1 subject (1/50, 2%) using the 21-day regimen. After intentionally introduced dosing errors (3 missed active tablets on Days 1 to 3) during the second treatment cycle, there was 1 subject (1/49, 2%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 4 subjects (4/50, 8%) using the 21-day regimen. Acne Acne vulgaris is a skin condition with a multifactorial etiology including androgen stimulation of sebum production. While the combination of EE and DRSP increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and decreases free testosterone, the relationship between these changes and a decrease in the severity of facial acne in otherwise healthy women with this skin condition has not been established. The impact of the antiandrogenic activity of DRSP on acne is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of DRSP from a single entity tablet is about 76%. The absolute bioavailability of EE is approximately 40% as a result of presystemic conjugation and first-pass metabolism . The absolute bioavailability of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets , which is a combination tablet of DRSP and EE has not been evaluated. Serum concentrations of DRSP and EE reached peak levels within 1 to 2 hours after administration of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. The pharmacokinetics of DRSP are dose proportional following single doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg. Following daily dosing of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets, steady state DRSP concentrations were observed after 8 days. There was about 2 to 3 fold accumulation in serum C max and AUC (0 to 24h) values of DRSP following multiple dose administration of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (see Table 3). For EE, steady-state conditions are reported during the second half of a treatment cycle. Following daily administration of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets, serum C max and AUC (0 to 24h) values of EE accumulate by a factor of about 1.5 to 2 (see Table 3).

The extent of absorption of DRSP, however, remained unchanged. In contrast, the extent of absorption of EE was reduced by about 20% under fed conditions. Distribution DRSP and EE serum concentrations decline in two phases. The apparent volume of distribution of DRSP is approximately 4 L/kg and that of EE is reported to be approximately 4 to 5 L/kg. DRSP does not bind to SHBG or corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) but binds about 97% to other serum proteins. Multiple dosing over 3 cycles resulted in no change in the free fraction (as measured at trough concentrations). EE is reported to be highly but non-specifically bound to serum albumin (approximately 98.5 %) and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of both SHBG and CBG. EE induced effects on SHBG and CBG were not affected by variation of the DRSP dosage in the range of 2 to 3 mg. Metabolism The two main metabolites of DRSP found in human plasma were identified to be the acid form of DRSP generated by opening of the lactone ring and the 4,5-dihydrodrospirenone-3-sulfate, formed by reduction and subsequent sulfation. These metabolites were shown not to be pharmacologically active. Drospirenone is also subject to oxidative metabolism catalyzed by CYP3A4. EE has been reported to be subject to significant gut and hepatic first-pass metabolism. Metabolism of EE and its oxidative metabolites occur primarily by conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. CYP3A4 in the liver is responsible for the 2-hydroxylation which is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion. Excretion DRSP serum concentrations are characterized by a terminal disposition phase half-life of approximately 30 hours after both single and multiple dose regimens. Excretion of DRSP was nearly complete after ten days and amounts excreted were slightly higher in feces compared to urine. DRSP was extensively metabolized and only trace amounts of unchanged DRSP were excreted in urine and feces. At least 20 different metabolites were observed in urine and feces. About 38 to 47% of the metabolites in urine were glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In feces, about 17 to 20% of the metabolites were excreted as glucuronides and sulfates. For EE the terminal disposition phase half-life has been reported to be approximately 24 hours. EE is not excreted unchanged. EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric Use : Safety and efficacy of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets have been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated. Geriatric Use : Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets have not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population. Race: No clinically significant difference was observed between the pharmacokinetics of DRSP or EE in Japanese versus Caucasian women (age 25 to 35) when 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE was administered daily for 21 days. Other ethnic groups have not been specifically studied. Renal Impairment : Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of DRSP (3 mg daily for 14 days) and the effect of DRSP on serum potassium concentrations were investigated in three separate groups of female subjects (n=28, age 30 to 65). All subjects were on a low potassium diet. During the study, 7 subjects continued the use of potassium-sparing drugs for the treatment of their underlying illness. On the 14th day (steady-state) of DRSP treatment, the serum DRSP concentrations in the group with CLcr of 50 to 79 mL/min were comparable to those in the control group with CLcr \u2265 80 mL/min. The serum DRSP concentrations were on average 37% higher in the group with CLcr of 30 to 49 mL/min compared to those in the control group. DRSP treatment did not show any clinically significant effect on serum potassium concentration. Although hyperkalemia was not observed in the study, in five of the seven subjects who continued use of potassium-sparing drugs during the study, mean serum potassium concentrations increased by up to 0.33 mEq/L. [See Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ).] Hepatic Impairment: Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease. The mean exposure to DRSP in women with moderate liver impairment is approximately three times higher than the exposure in women with normal liver function. Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets have not been studied in women with severe hepatic impairment. [See Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Drug Interactions Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with oral contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in 20 premenopausal women, co-administration of a DRSP (3 mg)/EE (0.02 mg) COC with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) for 10 days increased the AUC(0 to 24h) of DRSP and EE by 2.68-fold (90% CI: 2.44, 2.95) and 1.40-fold (90% CI: 1.31, 1.49), respectively. The increases in C max were 1.97-fold (90% CI: 1.79, 2.17) and 1.39-fold (90% CI: 1.28, 1.52) for DRSP and EE, respectively. Although no clinically relevant effects on safety or laboratory parameters including serum potassium were observed, this study only assessed subjects for 10 days. The clinical impact for a patient taking a DRSP-containing COC concomitantly with chronic use of a CYP3A4/5 inhibitor is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . HIV/HCV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro , EE is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 as well as a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8 and CYP2J2. Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic CYP enzymes have been investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies. In in vitro studies DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women [including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype] the daily oral administration of 3 mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the oral clearance of omeprazole (40 mg, single oral dose) and the CYP2C19 product 5-hydroxy omeprazole. Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found. These results demonstrate that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in vivo . Two additional clinical drug-drug interaction studies using simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrates for CYP3A4 were each performed in 24 healthy postmenopausal women. The results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steady state DRSP concentrations achieved after administration of 3 mg DRSP/day. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Interactions With Drugs That Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . A drug-drug interaction study of DRSP 3 mg/estradiol (E2) 1 mg versus placebo was performed in 24 mildly hypertensive postmenopausal women taking enalapril maleate 10 mg twice daily. Potassium concentrations were obtained every other day for a total of 2 weeks in all subjects. Mean serum potassium concentrations in the DRSP/E2 treatment group relative to baseline were 0.22 mEq/L higher than those in the placebo group. Serum potassium concentrations also were measured at multiple time points over 24 hours at baseline and on Day 14. On Day 14, the ratios for serum potassium C max and AUC in the DRSP/E2 group to those in the placebo group were 0.955 (90% CI: 0.914, 0.999) and 1.010 (90% CI: 0.944, 1.08), respectively. No patient in either treatment group developed hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentrations > 5.5 mEq/L)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA"], "effective_time": "20230629", "product_ndc": ["68462-720"], "brand_name": ["drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol"]}

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Varenicline binds with high affinity and selectivity at \u03b14\u03b22 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The efficacy of CHANTIX in smoking cessation is believed to be the result of varenicline's activity at \u03b14\u03b22 sub-type of the nicotinic receptor where its binding produces agonist activity, while simultaneously preventing nicotine binding to these receptors. Electrophysiology studies in vitro and neurochemical studies in vivo have shown that varenicline binds to \u03b14\u03b22 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and stimulates receptor-mediated activity, but at a significantly lower level than nicotine. Varenicline blocks the ability of nicotine to activate \u03b14\u03b22 receptors and thus to stimulate the central nervous mesolimbic dopamine system, believed to be the neuronal mechanism underlying reinforcement and reward experienced upon smoking. Varenicline is highly selective and binds more potently to \u03b14\u03b22 receptors than to other common nicotinic receptors (>500-fold \u03b13\u03b24, >3500-fold \u03b17, >20,000-fold \u03b11\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4), or to non-nicotinic receptors and transporters (>2000-fold). Varenicline also binds with moderate affinity (Ki = 350 nM) to the 5-HT3 receptor. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption/Distribution : Maximum plasma concentrations of varenicline occur typically within 3\u20134 hours after oral administration. Following administration of multiple oral doses of varenicline, steady-state conditions were reached within 4 days. Over the recommended dosing range, varenicline exhibits linear pharmacokinetics after single or repeated doses. In a mass balance study, absorption of varenicline was virtually complete after oral administration and systemic availability was ~90%. Oral bioavailability of varenicline is unaffected by food or time-of-day dosing. Plasma protein binding of varenicline is low (\u226420%) and independent of both age and renal function. Metabolism/Elimination : The elimination half-life of varenicline is approximately 24 hours. Varenicline undergoes minimal metabolism, with 92% excreted unchanged in the urine. Renal elimination of varenicline is primarily through glomerular filtration along with active tubular secretion possibly via the organic cation transporter, OCT2. Pharmacokinetics in Special Patient Populations : There are no clinically meaningful differences in varenicline pharmacokinetics due to age, race, gender, smoking status, or use of concomitant medications, as demonstrated in specific pharmacokinetic studies and in population pharmacokinetic analyses. Renal Impairment: Varenicline pharmacokinetics were unchanged in subjects with mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance >50 mL/min and \u226480 mL/min). In subjects with moderate renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance \u226530 mL/min and \u226450 mL/min), varenicline exposure increased 1.5-fold compared with subjects with normal renal function (estimated creatinine clearance >80 mL/min). In subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), varenicline exposure was increased 2.1-fold. In subjects with end-stage-renal disease (ESRD) undergoing a three-hour session of hemodialysis for three days a week, varenicline exposure was increased 2.7-fold following 0.5 mg once daily administration for 12 days. The plasma Cmax and AUC of varenicline noted in this setting were similar to those of healthy subjects receiving 1 mg twice daily. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Additionally, in subjects with ESRD, varenicline was efficiently removed by hemodialysis [see Overdosage (10) ]. Geriatric Patients: A combined single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of 1 mg varenicline given once daily or twice daily to 16 healthy elderly male and female smokers (aged 65\u201375 yrs) for 7 consecutive days was similar to that of younger subjects. Pediatric Patients: Because the safety and effectiveness of CHANTIX in pediatric patients have not been established, CHANTIX is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. Single and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of varenicline have been investigated in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years old (inclusive) and were approximately dose-proportional over the 0.5 mg to 2 mg daily dose range studied. Steady-state systemic exposure in adolescent patients of bodyweight >55 kg, as assessed by AUC (0\u201324), was comparable to that noted for the same doses in the adult population. When 0.5 mg BID was given, steady-state daily exposure of varenicline was, on average, higher (by approximately 40%) in adolescent patients with bodyweight \u2264 55 kg compared to that noted in the adult population. Hepatic Impairment: Due to the absence of significant hepatic metabolism, varenicline pharmacokinetics should be unaffected in patients with hepatic impairment. Drug-Drug Interactions : Drug interaction studies were performed with varenicline and digoxin, warfarin, transdermal nicotine, bupropion, cimetidine, and metformin. No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 >6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro , varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, drugs that are cleared by renal secretion (e.g., metformin [see below]) are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 (e.g., cimeditine [see below]) may not necessitate a dose adjustment of CHANTIX as the increase in systemic exposure to CHANTIX is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of CHANTIX [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ; therefore, a dose adjustment of CHANTIX would not be required. Metformin: When co-administered to 30 smokers, varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin (500 mg twice daily), which is a substrate of OCT2. Metformin had no effect on varenicline steady-state pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine: Co-administration of an OCT2 inhibitor, cimetidine (300 mg four times daily), with varenicline (2 mg single dose) to 12 smokers increased the systemic exposure of varenicline by 29% (90% CI: 21.5%, 36.9%) due to a reduction in varenicline renal clearance. Digoxin: Varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin administered as a 0.25 mg daily dose in 18 smokers. Warfarin: Varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single 25 mg dose of (R, S)-warfarin in 24 smokers. Prothrombin time (INR) was not affected by varenicline. Smoking cessation itself may result in changes to warfarin pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Use with Other Drugs for Smoking Cessation: Bupropion: Varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of bupropion (150 mg twice daily) in 46 smokers [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT): Although co-administration of varenicline (1 mg twice daily) and transdermal nicotine (21 mg/day) for up to 12 days did not affect nicotine pharmacokinetics, the incidence of adverse reactions was greater for the combination than for NRT alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]."], "manufacturer_name": ["Proficient Rx LP"], "effective_time": "20200201", "product_ndc": ["63187-618"], "brand_name": ["CHANTIX"]}

The structural formula for clindamycin is represented below: Clindamycin phosphate has a molecular weight of 504.97 and its chemical name is Methyl 7-chloro-6,7,8-trideoxy-6-(1-methyl-trans-4-propyl-L-2-pyrrolidinecarboxamido) - 1-thio-L- threo-alpha-D-galacto-octopyranoside 2-(dihydrogen phosphate). Clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 1%/5% also contains benzoyl peroxide, for topical use. Chemically, benzoyl peroxide is (C 14 H 10 O 4 ). It has the following structural formula: Benzoyl peroxide has a molecular weight of 242.23. Each gram of clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 1%/5% contains, as dispensed, 10 mg (1%) clindamycin as phosphate and 50 mg (5%) benzoyl peroxide in a base of carbomer homopolymer type C, sodium hydroxide, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, and purified water. Chemical Structure Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY An in vitro percutaneous penetration study comparing clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 1%/5% and topical 1% clindamycin gel alone, demonstrated there was no statistical difference in penetration between the two drugs. Mean systemic bioavailability of topical clindamycin in clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 1%/5% is suggested to be less than 1%. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid. Less than 2% of the dose enters systemic circulation as benzoic acid. It is suggested that the lipophilic nature of benzoyl peroxide acts to concentrate the compound into the lipid-rich sebaceous follicle. Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics (plasma and urine) of clindamycin from clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 1%/5% was studied in male and female patients (n=13) with acne vulgaris. Clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 1%/5% (~2g) was applied topically to the face and back twice daily for four and a half (4.5) days. Quantifiable (>LOQ=1ng/mL) clindamycin plasma concentrations were obtained in six of thirteen subjects (46.2%) on Day 1 and twelve of thirteen subjects (92.3%) on Day 5. Peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of clindamycin ranged from 1.47 ng/mL to 2.77 ng/mL on Day 1 and 1.43 ng/mL to 7.18 ng/mL on Day 5. The AUC (0-12h) ranged from 2.74 ng.h/mL to 12.86 ng.h/mL on Day 1 and 11.4 ng.h/mL to 69.7 ng.h/mL on Day 5. The amount of clindamycin excreted in the urine during the 12 hour dosing interval increased from a mean (SD) of 5745 (3130) ng on Day 1 to 12069 (7660) ng on Day 5. The mean % (SD) of the administered dose that was excreted in the urine ranged from 0.03% (0.02) to 0.08% (0.04). A comparison of the single (Day 1) and multiple (Day 5) dose plasma and urinary concentrations of clindamycin indicates that there is accumulation of clindamycin following multiple dosing of clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 1%/5%. The degree of accumulation calculated from the plasma and urinary excretion data was ~2-fold.

Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with CYLTEZO may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 \u00d7 10 -10 M). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131 \u00b1 56 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (V ss ) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis: In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis: In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis: Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during 40 mg adalimumab every other week treatment. Adult Uveitis : Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during 40 mg adalimumab every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa: In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to >75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: 4 years to 17 years of age: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing <30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u226530 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. 2 years to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u226540 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing <40 kg. Male and Female Patients: No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient's body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important.

Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol are rapidly absorbed from Blisovi 24 Fe tablets, with maximum plasma concentrations of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. Both are subject to first-pass metabolism after oral dosing, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 64% for norethindrone and 43% for ethinyl estradiol.

Distribution Volume of distribution of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol ranges from 2 to 4 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of both steroids is extensive (>95%); norethindrone binds to both albumin and SHBG, whereas ethinyl estradiol binds only to albumin. Although ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, it induces SHBG synthesis. Metabolism Norethindrone undergoes extensive biotransformation, primarily via reduction, followed by sulfate and glucuronide conjugation. The majority of metabolites in the circulation are sulfates, with glucuronides accounting for most of the urinary metabolites. Ethinyl estradiol is also extensively metabolized, both by oxidation and by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide. Sulfates are the major circulating conjugates of ethinyl estradiol and glucuronides predominate in urine. The primary oxidative metabolite is 2-hydroxy ethinyl estradiol, formed by the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450. Part of the first-pass metabolism of ethinyl estradiol is believed to occur in gastrointestinal mucosa. Ethinyl estradiol may undergo enterohepatic circulation. Excretion Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are excreted in both urine and feces, primarily as metabolites. Plasma clearance values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are similar (approximately 0.4 L/hr/kg). Steady-state elimination half-lives of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of Blisovi 24 Fe tablets are approximately 8 hours and 14 hours, respectively. image-2 image-4"], "manufacturer_name": ["Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc."], "effective_time": "20250508", "product_ndc": ["68180-864"], "brand_name": ["Blisovi 24 Fe"]}

Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets were evaluated for the treatment of acne vulgaris in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase 3, six (28-day) cycle studies. A total of 296 patients received norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and 295 received placebo. Mean age at enrollment for both groups was 24 years. At six months each study demonstrated a statistically significant difference between norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and placebo for mean change from baseline in lesion counts (see Table 3 and Figure 2). Each study also demonstrated overall treatment success in the investigator's global evaluation. Patients with severe androgen excess were not studied. Table 3.

Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation). In vitro and animal studies have shown that norethindrone combines high progestational activity with low intrinsic androgenicity. In humans, norethindrone acetate in combination with ethinyl estradiol does not counteract estrogen-induced increases in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Following multiple-dose administration of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets, serum SHBG concentrations increase two- to three-fold and free testosterone concentrations decrease by 47% to 64%, indicating minimal androgenic activity. ACNE Acne is a skin condition with a multifactorial etiology, including androgen stimulation of sebum production. While the combination of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and decreases free testosterone, the relationship between these changes and a decrease in the severity of facial acne in otherwise healthy women with this skin condition has not been established. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Norethindrone acetate appears to be completely and rapidly deacetylated to norethindrone after oral administration, since the disposition of norethindrone acetate is indistinguishable from that of orally administered norethindrone. Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol are rapidly absorbed, with maximum plasma concentrations of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol occurring 1 to 2 hours post-dose. Both are subject to first-pass metabolism after oral dosing, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 64% for norethindrone and 43% for ethinyl estradiol. Administration of norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol with a high fat meal decreases rate, but not extent,of ethinyl estradiol absorption. The extent of norethindrone absorption is increased by 27% following administration with food. Plasma concentrations of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following chronic administration of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets to 17 women are shown below ( Figure 1 ). Mean steady-state concentrations of norethindrone for the 1/20, 1/30, and 1/35 tablet strengths increased as ethinyl estradiol dose increased over the 21-day dose regimen, due to dose-dependent effects of ethinyl estradiol on serum SHBG concentrations ( Table 1 ).Mean steady-state plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol for the 1/20, 1/30, and 1/35 tablet strengths were proportional to ethinyl estradiol dose ( Table 1 ). Distribution Volume of distribution of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol ranges from 2 to 4 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of both steroids is extensive (>95%); norethindrone binds to both albumin and sex hormone binding globulin, whereas ethinyl estradiol binds only to albumin. Although ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, it induces SHBG synthesis. Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets increase serum SHBG concentrations two- to three-fold ( Table 1 ). Metabolism Norethindrone undergoes extensive biotransformation, primarily via reduction, followed by sulfate and glucuronide conjugation. The majority of metabolites in the circulation are sulfates, with glucuronides accounting for most of the urinary metabolites. A small amount of norethindrone acetate is metabolically converted to ethinyl estradiol. Ethinyl estradiol is also extensively metabolized, both by oxidation and by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide. Sulfates are the major circulating conjugates of ethinyl estradiol and glucuronides predominate in urine. The primary oxidative metabolite is 2-hydroxy ethinyl estradiol, formed by the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450. Part of the first-pass metabolism of ethinyl estradiol is believed to occur in gastrointestinal mucosa. Ethinyl estradiol may undergo enterohepatic circulation. Excretion Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are excreted in both urine and feces, primarily as metabolites. Plasma clearance values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are similar (approximately 0.4 L/hr/kg). Steady-state elimination half-lives of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets are approximately 13 hours and 19 hours, respectively. fig1 table1 Special Population Race: The effect of race on the disposition of Tilia Fe has not been evaluated. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal disease on the disposition of Tilia Fe has not been evaluated. In premenopausal women with chronic renal failure undergoing peritoneal dialysis who received multiple doses of a combined oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations were higher and norethindrone concentrations were unchanged compared to concentrations in premenopausal women with normal renal function. Hepatic Insufficiency The effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of Tilia Fe has not been evaluated. However, ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.

Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid are added as necessary to adjust pH."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with SIMLANDI may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131\u00b156 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7\u00b11.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (V ss ) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis: In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis: In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis: Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Uveitis: Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa: In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to >75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: 4 years to 17 years of age: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing <30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u226530 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. 2 years to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease: Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u226540 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing <40 kg. Male and Female Patients: No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient\u2019s body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations.

NGM is rapidly and completely metabolized by first pass (intestinal and/or hepatic) mechanisms to norelgestromin (NGMN) and norgestrel (NG), which are the major active metabolites of norgestimate. Peak serum concentrations of NGMN and EE are generally reached by 2 hours after administration of VyLibra. Accumulation following multiple dosing of the 250 mcg NGM / 35 mcg EE dose is approximately 2-fold for NGMN and EE compared with single dose administration. The pharmacokinetics of NGMN is dose-proportional following NGM doses of 180 mcg to 250 mcg. Steady-state concentration of EE is achieved by Day 7 of each dosing cycle. Steady-state concentrations of NGMN and NG are achieved by Day 21. Non-linear accumulation (approximately 8 fold) of NG is observed as a result of high-affinity binding to SHBG, which limits its biological activity (Table 3).

Distribution NGMN and NG are highly bound (>97%) to serum proteins. NGMN is bound to albumin and not to SHBG, while NG is bound primarily to SHBG. EE is extensively bound (>97%) to serum albumin and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of SHBG. Metabolism NGM is extensively metabolized by first-pass mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract and/or liver. NGM\u2019s primary active metabolite is NGMN. Subsequent hepatic metabolism of NGMN occurs and metabolites include NG, which is also active, and various hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites. Although NGMN and its metabolites inhibit a variety of P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes, under the recommended dosing regimen, the in vivo concentrations of NGMN and its metabolites, even at the peak serum levels, are relatively low compared to the inhibitory constant (K i ). EE is also metabolized to various hydroxylated products and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Excretion The metabolites of NGMN and EE are eliminated by renal and fecal pathways. Following administration of 14 C-norgestimate, 47% (45 to 49%) and 37% (16 to 49%) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and feces, respectively. Unchanged NGM was not detected in the urine. In addition to 17-deacetyl norgestimate, a number of metabolites of NGM have been identified in human urine following administration of radiolabeled NGM. These include 18, 19-Dinor-17-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one,17-hydroxy-13-ethyl,(17\u03b1)-(-);18,19-Dinor-5\u03b2-17-pregnan-20-yn,3\u03b1,17\u03b2-dihydroxy-13-ethyl,(17\u03b1), various hydroxylated metabolites and conjugates of these metabolites."], "manufacturer_name": ["Afaxys Pharma, LLC"], "effective_time": "20250104", "product_ndc": ["50102-235"], "brand_name": ["VyLibra"]}

Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation). Receptor binding studies, as well as studies in animals, have shown that etonogestrel, the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel, combines high progestational activity with minimal intrinsic androgenicity (91,92). The relevance of this latter finding in humans is unknown. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Desogestrel is rapidly and almost completely absorbed and converted into etonogestrel, its biologically active metabolite. Following oral administration, the relative bioavailability of desogestrel compared to a solution, as measured by serum levels of etonogestrel, is approximately 100%. and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets provide two different regimens of ethinyl estradiol; 0.02 mg in the combination tablet [white to off-white] as well as 0.01 mg in the light peach tablet. Ethinyl estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. After a single dose of Desogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets combination tablet [white to off-white], the relative bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol is approximately 93% while the relative bioavailability of the 0.01 mg tablet [light peach] is 99%. The effect of food on the bioavailability of desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets following oral administration has not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetics of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol following multiple dose administration of desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets were determined during the third cycle in 17 subjects. Plasma concentrations of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol reached steady-state by Day 21. The AUC(0\u201324) for etonogestrel at steady-state on Day 21 was approximately 2.2 times higher than AUC(0\u201324) on Day 1 of the third cycle. The pharmacokinetic parameters of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol during the third cycle following multiple dose administration of desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets are summarized in Table I.

Ethinyl estradiol is approximately 98.3% bound, mainly to plasma albumin. Ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis. Desogestrel, in combination with ethinyl estradiol, does not counteract the estrogen-induced increase in SHBG, resulting in lower serum levels of free testosterone (96\u201399). Metabolism Desogestrel Desogestrel is rapidly and completely metabolized by hydroxylation in the intestinal mucosa and on first pass through the liver to etonogestrel. Other metabolites (i.e., 3\u03b1-OH-desogestrel, 3\u00df-OH-desogestrel, and 3\u03b1-OH-5\u03b1-H-desogestrel) with no pharmacologic actions also have been identified and these metabolites may undergo glucuronide and sulfate conjugation. Ethinyl estradiol Ethinyl estradiol is subject to a significant degree of presystemic conjugation (phase II metabolism). Ethinyl estradiol escaping gut wall conjugation undergoes phase I metabolism and hepatic conjugation (phase II metabolism). Major phase I metabolites are 2-OH-ethinyl estradiol and 2-methoxy-ethinyl estradiol. Sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of both ethinyl estradiol and phase I metabolites, which are excreted in bile, can undergo enterohepatic circulation. Excretion Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol are excreted in urine, bile, and feces. At steady state, on Day 21, the elimination half-life of etonogestrel is 27.8\u00b17.2 hours and the elimination half-life of ethinyl estradiol for the combination tablet is 23.9\u00b125.5 hours. For the 0.01 mg ethinyl estradiol tablet [light peach], the elimination half-life at steady state, Day 28, is 18.9\u00b18.3 hours.

Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and the endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Drospirenone is a spironolactone analogue with anti-mineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity . The estrogen in drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets is ethinyl estradiol. Contraception Two studies evaluated the effect of 3 mg DRSP / 0.02 mg EE combinations on the suppression of ovarian activity as assessed by measurement of follicle size via transvaginal ultrasound and serum hormone (progesterone and estradiol) analyses during two treatment cycles (21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period). More than 90% of subjects in these studies demonstrated ovulation inhibition. One study compared the effect of 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE combinations with two different regimens (24-day active tablet period plus 4-day pill-free period vs. 21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period) on the suppression of ovarian activity during two treatment cycles. During the first treatment cycle, there were no subjects (0/49, 0%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 1 subject (1/50, 2%) using the 21-day regimen. After intentionally introduced dosing errors (3 missed active tablets on Days 1 to 3) during the second treatment cycle, there was 1 subject (1/49, 2%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 4 subjects (4/50, 8%) using the 21-day regimen. Acne Acne vulgaris is a skin condition with a multifactorial etiology including androgen stimulation of sebum production. While the combination of EE and DRSP increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and decreases free testosterone, the relationship between these changes and a decrease in the severity of facial acne in otherwise healthy women with this skin condition has not been established. The impact of the antiandrogenic activity of DRSP on acne is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of DRSP from a single entity tablet is about 76%. The absolute bioavailability of EE is approximately 40% as a result of presystemic conjugation and first-pass metabolism . The absolute bioavailability of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets , which is a combination tablet of DRSP and EE, has not been evaluated. Serum concentrations of DRSP and EE reached peak levels within 1 to 2 hours after administration of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. The pharmacokinetics of DRSP are dose proportional following single doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg. Following daily dosing of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets, steady state DRSP concentrations were observed after 8 days. There was about 2 to 3 fold accumulation in serum C max and AUC (0 to 24h) values of DRSP following multiple dose administration of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (see Table 2). For EE, steady-state conditions are reported during the second half of a treatment cycle. Following daily administration of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets, serum C max and AUC (0 to 24h) values of EE accumulate by a factor of about 1.5 to 2 (see Table 2).

NA = Not available Food Effect The rate of absorption of DRSP and EE following single administration of a formulation similar to drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets was slower under fed (high fat meal) conditions with the serum C max being reduced about 40% for both components. The extent of absorption of DRSP, however, remained unchanged. In contrast, the extent of absorption of EE was reduced by about 20% under fed conditions. Distribution DRSP and EE serum concentrations decline in two phases. The apparent volume of distribution of DRSP is approximately 4 L/kg and that of EE is reported to be approximately 4 to 5 L/kg. DRSP does not bind to SHBG or corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) but binds about 97% to other serum proteins. Multiple dosing over 3 cycles resulted in no change in the free fraction (as measured at trough concentrations). EE is reported to be highly but non-specifically bound to serum albumin (approximately 98.5 %) and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of both SHBG and CBG. EE induced effects on SHBG and CBG were not affected by variation of the DRSP dosage in the range of 2 to 3 mg. Metabolism The two main metabolites of DRSP found in human plasma were identified to be the acid form of DRSP generated by opening of the lactone ring and the 4,5-dihydrodrospirenone-3-sulfate, formed by reduction and subsequent sulfation. These metabolites were shown not to be pharmacologically active. Drospirenone is also subject to oxidative metabolism catalyzed by CYP3A4. EE has been reported to be subject to significant gut and hepatic first-pass metabolism. Metabolism of EE and its oxidative metabolites occur primarily by conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. CYP3A4 in the liver is responsible for the 2-hydroxylation which is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion. Excretion DRSP serum concentrations are characterized by a terminal disposition phase half-life of approximately 30 hours after both single and multiple dose regimens. Excretion of DRSP was nearly complete after ten days and amounts excreted were slightly higher in feces compared to urine. DRSP was extensively metabolized and only trace amounts of unchanged DRSP were excreted in urine and feces. At least 20 different metabolites were observed in urine and feces. About 38 to 47% of the metabolites in urine were glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In feces, about 17 to 20% of the metabolites were excreted as glucuronides and sulfates. For EE the terminal disposition phase half-life has been reported to be approximately 24 hours. EE is not excreted unchanged. EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric Use : Safety and efficacy of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets have been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated. Geriatric Use : Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets have not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population. Race: No clinically significant difference was observed between the pharmacokinetics of DRSP or EE in Japanese versus Caucasian women (age 25 to 35) when 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE was administered daily for 21 days. Other ethnic groups have not been specifically studied. Renal Impairment : Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of DRSP (3 mg daily for 14 days) and the effect of DRSP on serum potassium concentrations were investigated in three separate groups of female subjects (n=28, age 30 to 65). All subjects were on a low potassium diet. During the study, 7 subjects continued the use of potassium-sparing drugs for the treatment of their underlying illness. On the 14th day (steady-state) of DRSP treatment, the serum DRSP concentrations in the group with CLcr of 50 to 79 mL/min were comparable to those in the control group with CLcr \u2265 80 mL/min. The serum DRSP concentrations were on average 37% higher in the group with CLcr of 30 to 49 mL/min compared to those in the control group. DRSP treatment did not show any clinically significant effect on serum potassium concentration. Although hyperkalemia was not observed in the study, in five of the seven subjects who continued use of potassium-sparing drugs during the study, mean serum potassium concentrations increased by up to 0.33 mEq/L. [See Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) . ] Hepatic Impairment: Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease. The mean exposure to DRSP in women with moderate liver impairment is approximately three times higher than the exposure in women with normal liver function. Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets have not been studied in women with severe hepatic impairment. [See Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ).] Drug Interactions Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with oral contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in 20 premenopausal women, co-administration of a DRSP (3 mg)/EE (0.02 mg) COC with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) for 10 days increased the AUC(0 to 24h) of DRSP and EE by 2.68-fold (90% CI: 2.44, 2.95) and 1.40-fold (90% CI: 1.31, 1.49), respectively. The increases in C max were 1.97-fold (90% CI: 1.79, 2.17) and 1.39-fold (90% CI: 1.28, 1.52) for DRSP and EE, respectively. Although no clinically relevant effects on safety or laboratory parameters including serum potassium were observed, this study only assessed subjects for 10 days. The clinical impact for a patient taking a DRSP-containing COC concomitantly with chronic use of a CYP3A4/5 inhibitor is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . HIV/HCV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro , EE is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 as well as a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8 and CYP2J2. Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic CYP enzymes have been investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies. In in vitro studies DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women [including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype] the daily oral administration of 3 mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the oral clearance of omeprazole (40 mg, single oral dose) and the CYP2C19 product 5-hydroxy omeprazole. Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found. These results demonstrate that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in vivo . Two additional clinical drug-drug interaction studies using simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrates for CYP3A4 were each performed in 24 healthy postmenopausal women. The results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steady state DRSP concentrations achieved after administration of 3 mg DRSP/day. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Interactions With Drugs That Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . A drug-drug interaction study of DRSP 3 mg/estradiol (E2) 1 mg versus placebo was performed in 24 mildly hypertensive postmenopausal women taking enalapril maleate 10 mg twice daily. Potassium concentrations were obtained every other day for a total of 2 weeks in all subjects. Mean serum potassium concentrations in the DRSP/E2 treatment group relative to baseline were 0.22 mEq/L higher than those in the placebo group. Serum potassium concentrations also were measured at multiple time points over 24 hours at baseline and on Day 14. On Day 14, the ratios for serum potassium C max and AUC in the DRSP/E2 group to those in the placebo group were 0.955 (90% CI: 0.914, 0.999) and 1.010 (90% CI: 0.944, 1.08), respectively. No patient in either treatment group developed hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentrations > 5.5 mEq/L)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Proficient Rx LP"], "effective_time": "20220701", "product_ndc": ["71205-144"], "brand_name": ["drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol"]}

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostate tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In humans, administration of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in premenopausal females). However, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to below castrate threshold. In premenopausal females, estrogens are reduced to postmenopausal concentrations. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment. Long-term studies have shown that continuation of therapy with leuprolide acetate maintains testosterone below the castrate level for more than five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following two sequential injections of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION 22.5 mg administered with a 3-month interval, plasma leuprolide concentrations were similar among both cycles. After first administration, mean plasma leuprolide concentration of 46.8 ng/mL was observed at approximately 2 hours and the mean concentration then declined until next injection.

Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation). Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 have not been characterized; however, the following pharmacokinetic information regarding norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol is taken from the literature. Absorption Norethindrone acetate appears to be completely and rapidly deacetylated to norethindrone after oral administration, since the disposition of norethindrone acetate is indistinguishable from that of orally administered norethindrone ( 1 ). Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol are subject to first-pass metabolism after oral dosing, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 64% for norethindrone and 43% for ethinyl estradiol ( 1-3 ). Distribution Volume of distribution of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol ranges from 2 to 4 L/kg ( 1-3 ). Plasma protein binding of both steroids is extensive (greater than 95%); norethindrone binds to both albumin and sex hormone binding globulin, whereas ethinyl estradiol binds only to albumin ( 4 ). Metabolism Norethindrone undergoes extensive biotransformation, primarily via reduction, followed by sulfate and glucuronide conjugation. The majority of metabolites in the circulation are sulfates, with glucuronides accounting for most of the urinary metabolites ( 5 ). A small amount of norethindrone acetate is metabolically converted to ethinyl estradiol. Ethinyl estradiol is also extensively metabolized, both by oxidation and by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide. Sulfates are the major circulating conjugates of ethinyl estradiol and glucuronides predominate in urine. The primary oxidative metabolite is 2-hydroxy ethinyl estradiol, formed by the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450. Part of the first-pass metabolism of ethinyl estradiol is believed to occur in gastrointestinal mucosa. Ethinyl estradiol may undergo enterohepatic circulation ( 6 ). Excretion Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are excreted in both urine and feces, primarily as metabolites (5,6) . Plasma clearance values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are similar (approximately 0.4 L/hr/kg) ( 1-3 ). Special Population Race The effect of race on the disposition of Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 has not been evaluated. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal disease on the disposition of Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 has not been evaluated. In premenopausal women with chronic renal failure undergoing peritoneal dialysis who received multiple doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations were higher and norethindrone concentrations were unchanged compared to concentrations in premenopausal women with normal renal function. Hepatic Insufficiency The effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 has not been evaluated. However, ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.

Glucagon is produced by solid state peptide synthesis. The chemical structure of the glucagon is identical to human glucagon. Glucagon is a single-chain polypeptide that contains 29 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 3482.8 Daltons. The empirical formula is C 153 H 225 N 43 O 49 S. The primary sequence of glucagon is shown below. Glucagon (synthetic origin) is a white to off-white powder. It is relatively insoluble in water but is soluble at a pH of less than 3 or more than 9.5. Glucagon for injection, USP is a sterile, white to off white lyophilized powder or plug in a vial and a syringe of sterile diluent for intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous use. The vial contains 1 mg of glucagon USP, 49 mg of lactose monohydrate. Hydrochloric acid may have been added during manufacture to adjust the pH of the glucagon to 2.5 to 3.0. One International Unit of glucagon is equivalent to 1 mg of glucagon. The 1 mL diluent syringe contains 12 mg of glycerin, 1 mg hydrochloric acid, and Water for Injection, at pH 1.8 to 2.2. Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Glucagon increases blood glucose concentration by activating hepatic glucagon receptors, thereby stimulating glycogen breakdown and release of glucose from the liver. Hepatic stores of glycogen are necessary for glucagon to produce an antihypoglycemic effect. Extrahepatic effects of glucagon include relaxation of the smooth muscle of the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, and colon. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Treatment of Severe Hypoglycemia Blood glucose concentrations rise within 10 minutes of subcutaneous injection and mean maximal concentration of 136 mg/dL is attained 30 minutes after injection (see Figure 1). Similarly, following intramuscular injection, the mean peak glucose level was 138 mg/dL, which occurred at 26 minutes after injection.

However, literature indicates that levonorgestrel is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration (bioavailability about 100%) and is not subject to first-pass metabolism. Ethinyl estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but, due to first-pass metabolism in gut mucosa and liver, the bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol is between 38% and 48%. After a single dose of two levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets to 34 women under fasting conditions, the mean (\u00b1 SD) plasma area under the concentration time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C max ) of levonorgestrel were 41.7 \u00b1 18.0 ng*hour/mL and 4.4 \u00b1 1.8ng/mL, respectively, with a median time to maximum concentration (T max ) of 1.0 hours. The mean (\u00b1SD) plasma AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol were 1167 \u00b1 367 pg*hour/mL and 115 \u00b1 37 pg/mL, respectively, with a median T max of 1.5 hours. The plasma levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol pharmacokinetic profi les following a single dose of two levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets are shown in Figure 2 . Figure 2.

Ethinyl estradiol is about 97% bound to plasma albumin. Ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis. Metabolism Levonorgestrel: The most important metabolic pathway occurs in the reduction of the \u03944-3-oxo group and hydroxylation at positions 2\u03b1, 1\u03b2, and 16\u03b2, followed by conjugation. Most of the metabolites that circulate in the blood are sulfates of 3\u03b1, 5\u03b2-tetrahydro-levonorgestrel, while excretion occurs predominantly in the form of glucuronides. Some of the parent levonorgestrel also circulates as 17\u03b2-sulfate. Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several-fold, and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users. Ethinyl estradiol: Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4) in the liver are responsible for the 2\u2011hydroxylation that is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion. Levels of Cytochrome P450 (CYP3A) vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of ethinyl estradiol 2-hydroxylation. Ethinyl estradiol is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Excretion The elimination half-life for levonorgestrel is approximately 34 \u00b1 14 hours following a single dose. Levonorgestrel and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine (40% to 68%) and about 16% to 48% are excreted in feces. The elimination half-life of ethinyl estradiol is 17 \u00b1 5.7 hours.

In vitro, cabotegravir inhibited renal OAT1 (IC 50 = 0.81 microM) and OAT3 (IC 50 = 0.41 microM). Based on physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, cabotegravir may increase the AUC of OAT1/3 substrates up to approximately 80%. In vitro, cabotegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. \u200eSimulations using PBPK modeling show that no clinically significant interaction is expected during coadministration of cabotegravir with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1. In vitro, cabotegravir was not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, or OCT1. Cabotegravir is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP in vitro; however, because of its high permeability, no alteration in cabotegravir absorption is expected with coadministration of P-gp or BCRP inhibitors. Rilpivirine is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes. Drug interaction studies were not conducted with injectable cabotegravir or injectable rilpivirine. Drug interaction studies with oral cabotegravir or oral rilpivirine are summarized in Tables 12 , 13 , 14 , and 15 . Table 12.

The mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of cabotegravir in a strand transfer assay using purified recombinant HIV-1 integrase was 3.0 nM. Rilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine NNRTI of HIV-1 and inhibits HIV-1 replication by non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Rilpivirine does not inhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Cabotegravir exhibited antiviral activity against laboratory strains of HIV-1 (subtype B, n = 4) with mean 50 percent effective concentration (EC 50 ) values of 0.22 to 1.7 nM in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 293 cells. Cabotegravir demonstrated antiviral activity in PBMCs against a panel of 24 HIV-1 clinical isolates (3 in each of group M subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G and 3 in group O) with a median EC 50 value of 0.19 nM (range: 0.02 to 1.06 nM, n = 24). The median EC 50 value against subtype B clinical isolates was 0.05 nM (range: 0.02 to 0.50 nM, n = 3). Against clinical HIV-2 isolates, the median EC 50 value was 0.12 nM (range: 0.10 to 0.14 nM, n = 3). Rilpivirine exhibited activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 in an acutely infected T-cell line with a median EC 50 value for HIV-1 IIIB of 0.73 nM (0.27 ng/mL). Rilpivirine demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M (subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G, and H) primary isolates with EC 50 values ranging from 0.07 nM to 1.01 nM (0.03 to 0.37 ng/mL) and was less active against group O primary isolates with EC 50 values ranging from 2.88 nM to 8.45 nM (1.06 to 3.10 ng/mL). In cell culture, cabotegravir was not antagonistic in combination with the NNRTI rilpivirine, or the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) emtricitabine (FTC), lamivudine (3TC), or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). The antiviral activity of rilpivirine was not antagonistic when combined with the NNRTIs efavirenz, etravirine, or nevirapine; the NRTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, or zidovudine; the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir; the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide; the CCR5 co-receptor antagonist maraviroc, or the INSTI raltegravir. Resistance Cell Culture: Cabotegravir-resistant viruses were selected during passage of HIV-1 strain IIIB in MT-2 cells in the presence of cabotegravir. Amino acid substitutions in integrase that emerged and conferred decreased susceptibility to cabotegravir included Q146L (fold change: 1.3 to 4.6), S153Y (fold change: 2.8 to 8.4), and I162M (fold change: 2.8). The integrase substitution T124A also emerged alone (fold change: 1.1 to 7.4 in cabotegravir susceptibility), in combination with S153Y (fold change: 3.6 to 6.6 in cabotegravir susceptibility) or I162M (2.8-fold change in cabotegravir susceptibility). Cell culture passage of virus harboring integrase substitutions Q148H, Q148K, or Q148R selected for additional substitutions (C56S, V72I, L74M, V75A, T122N, E138K, G140S, G149A, and M154I), with substituted viruses having reduced susceptibility to cabotegravir of 2.0- to 410-fold change. The combinations of E138K+Q148K and V72I+E138K+Q148K conferred the greatest reductions of 53- to 260\u2011fold change and 410-fold change, respectively. Rilpivirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different origins and subtypes as well as NNRTI-resistant HIV-1. The frequently observed amino acid substitutions that emerged and conferred decreased phenotypic susceptibility to rilpivirine included L100I; K101E; V106I and A; V108I; E138K and G, Q, R; V179F and I; Y181C and I; V189I; G190E; H221Y; F227C; and M230I and L. Clinical Trials: In the pooled Phase 3 FLAIR (Week 124) and ATLAS (Week 96) analysis, there were 8 confirmed virologic failures (2 consecutive HIV-1 RNA \u2265200 copies/mL) on cabotegravir plus rilpivirine (8/591, 1.4%) and 8 confirmed virologic failures on current antiretroviral regimen (8/591, 1.4%). Of the 8 confirmed virologic failures in the cabotegravir plus rilpivirine arm, 7 (88%) had treatment-emergent NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions K101E, V106V/A, V108I, E138A, E138G, E138K, H221H/L, or M230L in reverse transcriptase, and 6 of them showed reduced phenotypic susceptibility to rilpivirine (range: 2- to 27-fold). One additional participant in the ATLAS Extension Switch on cabotegravir plus rilpivirine had emergent NNRTI resistance substitution E138A at Week 80 with HIV-1 RNA >50 copies/mL and <200 copies/mL. Additionally, 5 of the 8 (63%) cabotegravir plus rilpivirine confirmed virologic failures had treatment-emergent INSTI resistance-associated substitutions and reduced phenotypic susceptibility to cabotegravir: Q148R (n = 2; 5- and 9-fold decreased susceptibility to cabotegravir), G140R (n = 1; 7-fold decreased susceptibility to cabotegravir), N155H (n = 1; 3\u2011fold decreased susceptibility to cabotegravir), or N155H+R263K (n = 1; 9-fold decreased susceptibility to cabotegravir). There was another confirmed virologic failure participant at Week 112 in FLAIR who had switched to cabotegravir plus rilpivirine direct to injection at Week 100; there were no INSTI resistance\u2011associated substitutions detected at failure. In comparison, in the current antiretroviral regimen arm with 8 confirmed virologic failures, 2 of 7 (29%) who had post-baseline resistance data had treatment-emergent resistance substitutions and phenotypic resistance to their antiretroviral drugs; both had treatment-emergent NRTI substitutions, M184V or I, which conferred resistance to emtricitabine or lamivudine in their regimen, and one of them also had the treatment-emergent NNRTI resistance substitution G190S, which conferred resistance to efavirenz in their regimen. In the ATLAS-2M trial, there were 11 confirmed virologic failures (2 consecutive HIV-1 RNA \u2265200 copies/mL) through Week 48: 9 participants (1.7%) in the every-2-month treatment arm and 2 participants (0.4%) in the monthly treatment arm. Of note, 8 of the 11 (73%) participants met confirmed virologic failure criteria at or before the Week 24 injection visit. Four of the 9 confirmed virologic failure participants in the every-2-month arm transitioned from the oral current antiretroviral regimen arm of ATLAS into this trial. In the every-2-month treatment arm, 8 of 9 (89%) confirmed virologic failure participants had NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions (E138E/K+V179V/I, K101E+E138A, A98G+K103N, E138K, V179I+Y188L+P225H, Y188L, K103N+E138A, or K101E) at virologic failure. Decreases in rilpivirine susceptibility for these 8 participant isolates ranged from 2- to 30-fold. Six of the 8 participants with NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions also had INSTI resistance-associated substitutions (L74I+Q148Q/R+N155N/H (n = 2), L74I+T97A+N155H, L74I+N155H, N155H, or L74I+Q148R) at failure with cabotegravir fold changes ranging from 1- to 9-fold. The INSTI polymorphism L74I was detected at baseline in 5 of the virologic failure participants by a HIV-1 proviral DNA assay. In the monthly treatment arm, both of the confirmed virologic failure participants had NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions (K101E+M230L or Y188F+G190Q) at virologic failure with decreased susceptibility to rilpivirine of 17- and >119.2-fold, respectively. Both participants also had INSTI resistance-associated substitutions (N155N/H or Q148R+E138E/K) at failure with decreased susceptibility to cabotegravir of 2- and 5-fold, respectively. Neither participant had the L74I integrase polymorphism at baseline. Genotypic Baseline Factors Associated with Virologic Failure An increased risk of cabotegravir plus rilpivirine confirmed virologic failure is associated with baseline virological factors: HIV-1 subtype A1, the presence of baseline integrase L74I polymorphism, and archived NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions. Association of Subtype A1 and Baseline L74I Polymorphism in Integrase with Cabotegravir plus Rilpivirine Virologic Failure Eight of the 18 (44%) cabotegravir plus rilpivirine confirmed virologic failures in FLAIR, ATLAS, and ATLAS-2M had HIV\u20111 subtype A1 with 7 of the 8 subtype A1 failures having the integrase polymorphism L74I detected at baseline and failure timepoints ( Table 16 ). There was no detectable phenotypic resistance to cabotegravir conferred by the presence of L74I at baseline. Subtype A1 is uncommon in the U.S. The presence of the integrase polymorphism L74I in subtype B commonly seen in the U.S. was not associated with virologic failure. In contrast to FLAIR and ATLAS, where all virologic failures were subtype A, A1, or AG, subtypes of the cabotegravir plus rilpivirine virologic failures in ATLAS-2M included A (n = 1), A1 (n = 3), B (n = 4), C (n = 2), and complex/A1 (n = 1). Association of Archived Baseline NNRTI Substitutions with Cabotegravir plus Rilpivirine Virologic Failure The presence of archived NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions at baseline detected using an exploratory HIV-1 proviral DNA assay was associated with a higher virologic failure rate in the every-2-month arm of ATLAS-2M and in the cabotegravir plus rilpivirine arm (monthly) of ATLAS compared to without archived NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions ( Table 16 ). However, in clinical practice, it is unlikely baseline resistance testing will be performed on virologically suppressed patients (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL). Thus, in patients with an incomplete or uncertain NNRTI treatment history, consideration should be given before starting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine treatment. Table 16.

All confirmed virologic isolates with genotypic evidence of cabotegravir resistance had cross-resistance to elvitegravir and raltegravir but retained phenotypic susceptibility to dolutegravir and when tested bictegravir. Virologic failure isolates with rilpivirine resistance had cross-resistance with NNRTIs delavirdine, doravirine, efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine. Cabotegravir: Cross-resistance has been observed among INSTIs. Cabotegravir had reduced susceptibility (>5-fold change) to recombinant HIV-1 strain NL432 viruses harboring the following integrase amino acid substitutions: G118R, Q148K, Q148R, T66K+L74M, E92Q+N155H, E138A+Q148R, E138K+Q148K/R, G140C+Q148R, G140S+Q148H/K/R, Y143H+N155H, and Q148R+N155H (range: 5.1- to 81-fold). The substitutions E138K+Q148K and Q148R+N155H conferred the greatest reductions in susceptibility of 81- and 61-fold, respectively. Cabotegravir was active against viruses harboring the NNRTI substitutions K103N or Y188L, or the NRTI substitutions M184V, D67N/K70R/T215Y, or V75I/F77L/F116Y/Q151M. Rilpivirine: Cross-resistance has been observed among NNRTIs. The single NNRTI substitutions K101P, Y181I, and Y181V conferred 52-, 15-, and 12-times fold change to rilpivirine, respectively. The K103N substitution did not show reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine by itself. Combinations of 2 or 3 NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions gave 3.7- to 554-fold change to rilpivirine in 38% and 66% of substitutions, respectively. Considering all available cell culture and clinical data, any of the following amino acid substitutions, when present at baseline, are likely to decrease the antiviral activity of rilpivirine: K101E and P; E138A, G, K, R, and Q; V179L; Y181C, I, and V; Y188L; H221Y; F227C; M230I and L, and the combination of L100I/K103N."], "manufacturer_name": ["ViiV Healthcare Company"], "effective_time": "20250411", "product_ndc": ["49702-240", "49702-253", "49702-266"], "brand_name": ["Cabenuva"]}

Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation). Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 have not been characterized; however, the following pharmacokinetic information regarding norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol is taken from the literature. Absorption Norethindrone acetate appears to be completely and rapidly deacetylated to norethindrone after oral administration, since the disposition of norethindrone acetate is indistinguishable from that of orally administered norethindrone (1) . Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol are subject to first-pass metabolism after oral dosing, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 64% for norethindrone and 43% for ethinyl estradiol (1-3) . Distribution Volume of distribution of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol ranges from 2 to 4 L/kg (1-3) . Plasma protein binding of both steroids is extensive (greater than 95%); norethindrone binds to both albumin and sex hormone binding globulin, whereas ethinyl estradiol binds only to albumin (4) . Metabolism Norethindrone undergoes extensive biotransformation, primarily via reduction, followed by sulfate and glucuronide conjugation. The majority of metabolites in the circulation are sulfates, with glucuronides accounting for most of the urinary metabolites (5) . A small amount of norethindrone acetate is metabolically converted to ethinyl estradiol. Ethinyl estradiol is also extensively metabolized, both by oxidation and by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide. Sulfates are the major circulating conjugates of ethinyl estradiol and glucuronides predominate in urine. The primary oxidative metabolite is 2-hydroxy ethinyl estradiol, formed by the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450. Part of the first-pass metabolism of ethinyl estradiol is believed to occur in gastrointestinal mucosa. Ethinyl estradiol may undergo enterohepatic circulation (6) . Excretion Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are excreted in both urine and feces, primarily as metabolites (5,6) . Plasma clearance values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are similar (approximately 0.4 L/hr/kg) (1-3) . Special Population Race: The effect of race on the disposition of Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 has not been evaluated. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal disease on the disposition of Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 has not been evaluated. In premenopausal women with chronic renal failure undergoing peritoneal dialysis who received multiple doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations were higher and norethindrone concentrations were unchanged compared to concentrations in premenopausal women with normal renal function. Hepatic Insufficiency The effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 has not been evaluated. However, ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.

The estrogen in Zumandimine is ethinyl estradiol (EE). No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Zumandimine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of DRSP from a single entity tablet is about 76%. The absolute bioavailability of EE is approximately 40% as a result of presystemic conjugation and first-pass metabolism. The absolute bioavailability of Zumandimine, which is a combination tablet of DRSP and EE, has not been evaluated. Serum concentrations of DRSP and EE reached peak levels within 1 to 2 hours after administration of Zumandimine. The pharmacokinetics of DRSP are dose proportional following single doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg. Following daily dosing of Zumandimine, steady state DRSP concentrations were observed after 8 days. There was about 2 to 3 fold accumulation in serum C max and AUC (0-24h) values of DRSP following multiple dose administration of Zumandimine (see Table 3). For EE, steady-state conditions are reported during the second half of a treatment cycle. Following daily administration of Zumandimine serum C max and AUC (0-24h) values of EE accumulate by a factor of about 1.5 to 2 (see Table 3).

The extent of absorption of DRSP, however, remained unchanged. In contrast, the extent of absorption of EE was reduced by about 20% under fed conditions. Distribution DRSP and EE serum concentrations decline in two phases. The apparent volume of distribution of DRSP is approximately 4 L/kg and that of EE is reported to be approximately 4 to 5 L/kg. DRSP does not bind to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) or corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) but binds about 97% to other serum proteins. Multiple dosing over 3 cycles resulted in no change in the free fraction (as measured at trough concentrations). EE is reported to be highly but non-specifically bound to serum albumin (approximately 98.5 %) and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of both SHBG and CBG. EE induced effects on SHBG and CBG were not affected by variation of the DRSP dosage in the range of 2 to 3 mg. Metabolism The two main metabolites of DRSP found in human plasma were identified to be the acid form of DRSP generated by opening of the lactone ring and the 4,5-dihydrodrospirenone-3-sulfate, formed by reduction and subsequent sulfation. These metabolites were shown not to be pharmacologically active. Drospirenone is also subject to oxidative metabolism catalyzed by CYP3A4. EE has been reported to be subject to significant gut and hepatic first-pass metabolism. Metabolism of EE and its oxidative metabolites occur primarily by conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. CYP3A4 in the liver is responsible for the 2-hydroxylation which is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion . Excretion DRSP serum concentrations are characterized by a terminal disposition phase half-life of approximately 30 hours after both single and multiple dose regimens. Excretion of DRSP was nearly complete after ten days and amounts excreted were slightly higher in feces compared to urine. DRSP was extensively metabolized and only trace amounts of unchanged DRSP were excreted in urine and feces. At least 20 different metabolites were observed in urine and feces. About 38 to 47% of the metabolites in urine were glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In feces, about 17 to 20% of the metabolites were excreted as glucuronides and sulfates. For EE the terminal disposition phase half-life has been reported to be approximately 24 hours. EE is not excreted unchanged. EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric Use : Safety and efficacy of Zumandimine has been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated. Geriatric Use : Zumandimine has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population. Race: No clinically significant difference was observed between the pharmacokinetics of DRSP or EE in Japanese versus Caucasian women (age 25 to 35) when 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE was administered daily for 21 days. Other ethnic groups have not been specifically studied. Renal Impairment : Zumandimine is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of DRSP (3 mg daily for 14 days) and the effect of DRSP on serum potassium concentrations were investigated in three separate groups of female subjects (n=28, age 30 to 65). All subjects were on a low potassium diet. During the study, 7 subjects continued the use of potassium-sparing drugs for the treatment of their underlying illness. On the 14th day (steady-state) of DRSP treatment, the serum DRSP concentrations in the group with CLcr of 50 to 79 mL/min were comparable to those in the control group with CLcr \u2265 80 mL/min. The serum DRSP concentrations were on average 37% higher in the group with CLcr of 30 to 49 mL/min compared to those in the control group. DRSP treatment did not show any clinically significant effect on serum potassium concentration. Although hyperkalemia was not observed in the study, in five of the seven subjects who continued use of potassium sparing drugs during the study, mean serum potassium concentrations increased by up to 0.33 mEq/L. [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) .] Hepatic Impairment: Zumandimine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease. The mean exposure to DRSP in women with moderate liver impairment is approximately three times higher than the exposure in women with normal liver function. Zumandimine has not been studied in women with severe hepatic impairment. [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) .] Drug Interactions Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with oral contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in 20 premenopausal women, co-administration of a DRSP (3 mg)/EE (0.02 mg) COC with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) for 10 days increased the AUC (0-24h) of DRSP and EE by 2.68-fold (90% CI: 2.44, 2.95) and 1.40-fold (90% CI: 1.31, 1.49), respectively. The increases in C max were 1.97-fold (90% CI: 1.79, 2.17) and 1.39-fold (90% CI: 1.28, 1.52) for DRSP and EE, respectively. Although no clinically relevant effects on safety or laboratory parameters including serum potassium were observed, this study only assessed subjects for 10 days. The clinical impact for a patient taking a DRSP-containing COC concomitantly with chronic use of a CYP3A4/5 inhibitor is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . HIV/HCV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro , EE is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 as well as a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8, and CYP2J2. Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic CYP enzymes have been investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies. In in vitro studies DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women [including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype] the daily oral administration of 3 mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the oral clearance of omeprazole (40 mg, single oral dose) and the CYP2C19 product 5-hydroxy omeprazole. Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found. These results demonstrate that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in vivo . Two additional clinical drug-drug interaction studies using simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrates for CYP3A4 were each performed in 24 healthy postmenopausal women. The results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steady state DRSP concentrations achieved after administration of 3 mg DRSP/day. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Interactions With Drugs That Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration : There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Zumandimine with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . A drug-drug interaction study of DRSP 3 mg/estradiol (E2) 1 mg versus placebo was performed in 24 mildly hypertensive postmenopausal women taking enalapril maleate 10 mg twice daily. Potassium concentrations were obtained every other day for a total of 2 weeks in all subjects. Mean serum potassium concentrations in the DRSP/E2 treatment group relative to baseline were 0.22 mEq/L higher than those in the placebo group. Serum potassium concentrations also were measured at multiple time points over 24 hours at baseline and on Day 14. On Day 14, the ratios for serum potassium C max and AUC in the DRSP/E2 group to those in the placebo group were 0.955 (90% CI: 0.914, 0.999) and 1.010 (90% CI: 0.944, 1.08), respectively. No patient in either treatment group developed hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentrations > 5.5 mEq/L)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Aurobindo Pharma Limited"], "effective_time": "20231009", "product_ndc": ["59651-030"], "brand_name": ["Zumandimine"]}

Oral contraceptives are highly effective. Table I lists the typical accidental pregnancy rates for users of combined oral contraceptives and other methods of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive methods, except sterilization, the IUD, and the Norplant System depends upon the reliability with which they are used. Correct and consistent use of these methods can result in lower failure rates. In a clinical trial with desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets 1,195 subjects completed 11,656 cycles and a total of 10 pregnancies were reported. This represents an overall user-efficacy (typical user-efficacy) pregnancy rate of 1.12 per 100 women-years. This rate includes patients who did not take the drug correctly.

Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus, and changes in the endometrium which reduce the likelihood of implantation. Receptor binding studies, as well as studies in animals, have shown that 3-keto-desogestrel, the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel, combines high progestational activity with minimal intrinsic androgenicity. 91,92 The relevance of this latter finding in humans is unknown. Pharmacokinetics Desogestrel is rapidly and almost completely absorbed and converted into 3-ketodesogestrel, its biologically active metabolite. Following oral administration, the relative bioavailability of desogestrel, as measured by serum levels of 3-keto-desogestrel, is approximately 84%. In the third cycle of use after a single dose of desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets, maximum concentrations of 3-keto-desogestrel of 2,805 \u00b1 1,203 pg/mL (mean \u00b1 SD) are reached at 1.4 \u00b1 0.8 hours. The area under the curve (AUC 0 -\u221e) is 33,858 \u00b1 11,043 pg/mL*hr after a single dose. At steady state, attained from at least day 19 onwards, maximum concentrations of 5,840 \u00b1 1,667 pg/mL are reached at 1.4 \u00b1 0.9 hours. The minimum plasma levels of 3-keto-desogestrel at steady state are 1,400 \u00b1 560 pg/mL. The AUC 0-24 at steady state is 52,299 \u00b1 17,878 pg/mL*hr. The mean AUC 0 -\u221e for 3-keto-desogestrel at single dose is significantly lower than the mean AUC 0-24 at steady state. This indicates that the kinetics of 3-keto-desogestrel are non-linear due to an increase in binding of 3-keto-desogestrel to sex hormone-binding globulin in the cycle, attributed to increased sex hormone-binding globulin levels which are induced by the daily administration of ethinyl estradiol. Sex hormone-binding globulin levels increased significantly in the third treatment cycle from day 1 (150 \u00b1 64 nmol/L) to day 21 (230 \u00b1 59 nmol/L). The elimination half-life for 3-keto-desogestrel is approximately 38 \u00b1 20 hours at steady state. In addition to 3-keto-desogestrel, other phase I metabolites are 3\u03b1-OH-desogestrel, 3\u03b2-OH-desogestrel, and 3\u03b1-OH-5\u03b1-H-desogestrel. These other metabolites are not known to have any pharmacologic effects, and are further converted in part by conjugation (phase II metabolism) into polar metabolites, mainly sulfates and glucuronides. Ethinyl estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. In the third cycle of use after a single dose of desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets, the relative bioavailability is approximately 83%. In the third cycle of use after a single dose of desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets, maximum concentrations of ethinyl estradiol of 95 \u00b1 34 pg/mL are reached at 1.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours. The AUC 0 -\u221e is 1,471 \u00b1 268 pg/mL*hr after a single dose. At steady state, attained from at least day 19 onwards, maximum ethinyl estradiol concentrations of 141 \u00b1 48 pg/mL are reached at about 1.4 \u00b1 0.7 hours. The minimum serum levels of ethinyl estradiol at steady state are 24 \u00b1 8.3 pg/mL. The AUC 0-24 at steady state is 1,117 \u00b1 302 pg/mL*hr. The mean AUC 0 -\u221e for ethinyl estradiol following a single dose during treatment cycle 3 does not significantly differ from the mean AUC 0-24 at steady state. This finding indicates linear kinetics for ethinyl estradiol. The elimination half-life is 26 \u00b1 6.8 hours at steady state. Ethinyl estradiol is subject to a significant degree of presystemic conjugation (phase II metabolism). Ethinyl estradiol escaping gut wall conjugation undergoes phase I metabolism and hepatic conjugation (phase II metabolism). Major phase I metabolites are 2-OH-ethinyl estradiol and 2-methoxy-ethinyl estradiol.

These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, drug resistance, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of orally administered COMETRIQ 140 mg on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in patients with MTC. A mean increase in QTcF of 10 - 15 ms was observed at 4 weeks after initiating COMETRIQ. A concentration-QTc relationship could not be definitively established. Changes in cardiac wave form morphology or new rhythms were not observed. No COMETRIQ-treated patients had a QTcF > 500 ms [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A population pharmacokinetic analysis of cabozantinib was performed using data collected from 289 patients with solid tumors including MTC following oral administration of 140 mg daily doses. Repeat daily dosing of COMETRIQ at 140 mg for 19 days resulted in 4- to 5-fold mean cabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared to a single dose administration; steady state was achieved by Day 15. Absorption Following oral administration of COMETRIQ, median time to peak cabozantinib plasma concentrations (T max ) ranged from 2 to 5 hours post-dose. A 19% increase in the C max of the tablet formulation (CABOMETYX \u2122 ) compared to the capsule formulation (COMETRIQ) was observed following a single 140 mg dose. A less than 10% difference in the AUC was observed between cabozantinib tablet (CABOMETYX) and capsule (COMETRIQ) formulations [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Cabozantinib C max and AUC values increased by 41% and 57%, respectively, following a high-fat meal relative to fasted conditions in healthy subjects administered a single 140 mg oral COMETRIQ dose. Distribution The oral volume of distribution (V/F) of cabozantinib is approximately 349 L. Cabozantinib is highly protein bound in human plasma (\u2265 99.7%). Elimination The predicted effective half-life is approximately 55 hours and the clearance (CL/F) at steady-state is estimated to be 4.4 L/hr. Metabolism Cabozantinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 in vitro . Excretion Approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered within a 48-day collection period following a single 140 mg dose of an investigational 14 C-cabozantinib formulation in healthy subjects. Approximately 54% was recovered in feces and 27% in urine. Unchanged cabozantinib accounted for 43% of the total radioactivity in feces and was not detectable in urine following a 72 hour collection. Specific Populations The following patient characteristics did not result in a clinically relevant difference in the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib: age (20-86 years), sex, race (Whites and non-Whites), or mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as estimated by MDRD (modification of diet in renal disease equation)). The pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib is unknown in patients with worse than moderate renal impairment (eGFR less than 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) as estimated by MDRD equation or renal impairment requiring dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following a single oral 60 mg COMETRIQ, mean AUC 0-inf for cabozantinib increased by 81% in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) hepatic impairment and 63% in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . The pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib has not been studied in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies CYP3A4 Inhibition on Cabozantinib Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 27 days) to healthy subjects increased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC 0-inf ) by 38%. CYP3A4 Induction on Cabozantinib Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin (600 mg daily for 31 days) to healthy subjects decreased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC 0-inf ) by 77%. Cabozantinib on CYP2C8 substrates No clinically-significant effect on single-dose rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) plasma exposure (C max and AUC) was observed when co-administered with cabozantinib at steady-state plasma concentrations (\u2265 100 mg/day daily for a minimum of 21 days) in patients with solid tumors. Gastric pH modifying agents on Cabozantinib No clinically-significant effect on plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC) was observed following co-administration of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole (40 mg daily for 6 days) with a single dose of 100 mg cabozantinib to healthy volunteers. In vitro Studies Metabolic Pathways: Inhibition of CYP3A4 reduced the formation of the XL184 N -oxide metabolite by >80%. Inhibition of CYP2C9 had a minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation (i.e., a <20% reduction). Inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. Although cabozantinib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro , a clinical study of this potential interaction concluded that concurrent use did not result in a clinically relevant effect on CYP2C8 substrate exposure. Given this finding, other less sensitive substrates of pathways affected by cabozantinib in vitro (i.e., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) were not evaluated in a clinical study because, although a clinically relevant exposure effect cannot be ruled out, it is unlikely. Cabozantinib does not inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 isozymes in vitro . Cabozantinib is an inducer of CYP1A1 mRNA; however, the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Cabozantinib does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4.

( 1.1 ) Treat symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) for females of reproductive potential who choose to use an oral contraceptive for contraception. ( 1.2 ) Treat moderate acne for women at least 14 years old only if the patient desires an oral contraceptive for birth control. ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Oral Contraceptive Jasmiel \u00ae is indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy. 1.2 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) Jasmiel is also indicated for the treatment of symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in females of reproductive potential who choose to use an oral contraceptive as their method of contraception. The effectiveness of Jasmiel for PMDD when used for more than three menstrual cycles has not been evaluated. The essential features of PMDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-4th edition (DSM-IV) include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. In this disorder, these symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school, or with usual social activities and relationships with others. Diagnosis is made by healthcare providers according to DSM-IV criteria, with symptomatology assessed prospectively over at least two menstrual cycles. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders. Jasmiel has not been evaluated for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). 1.3 Acne Jasmiel is indicated for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris in women at least 14 years of age, who have no known contraindications to oral contraceptive therapy and have achieved menarche.

Chemical Str"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Drospirenone is a spironolactone analogue with anti-mineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity. The estrogen in Jasmiel is ethinyl estradiol. Contraception Two studies evaluated the effect of 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE combinations on the suppression of ovarian activity as assessed by measurement of follicle size via transvaginal ultrasound and serum hormone (progesterone and estradiol) analyses during two treatment cycles (21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period). More than 90% of subjects in these studies demonstrated ovulation inhibition. One study compared the effect of 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE combinations with two different regimens (24-day active tablet period plus 4-day pill-free period vs. 21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period) on the suppression of ovarian activity during two treatment cycles. During the first treatment cycle, there were no subjects (0/49, 0%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 1 subject (1/50, 2%) using the 21-day regimen. After intentionally introduced dosing errors (3 missed active tablets on Days 1 to 3) during the second treatment cycle, there was 1 subject (1/49, 2%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 4 subjects (4/50, 8%) using the 21-day regimen. Acne Acne vulgaris is a skin condition with a multifactorial etiology including androgen stimulation of sebum production. While the combination of EE and DRSP increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and decreases free testosterone, the relationship between these changes and a decrease in the severity of facial acne in otherwise healthy women with this skin condition has not been established. The impact of the antiandrogenic activity of DRSP on acne is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of DRSP from a single entity tablet is about 76%. The absolute bioavailability of EE is approximately 40% as a result of presystemic conjugation and first-pass metabolism. The absolute bioavailability of Jasmiel, which is a combination tablet of DRSP and EE, has not been evaluated. Serum concentrations of DRSP and EE reached peak levels within 1 to 2 hours after administration of Jasmiel. The pharmacokinetics of DRSP are dose proportional following single doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg. Following daily dosing of Jasmiel, steady state DRSP concentrations were observed after 8 days. There was about 2 to 3 fold accumulation in serum C max and AUC (0 to 24h) values of DRSP following multiple dose administration of Jasmiel (see Table 3). For EE, steady-state conditions are reported during the second half of a treatment cycle. Following daily administration of Jasmiel, serum C max and AUC (0 to 24h) values of EE accumulate by a factor of about 1.5 to 2 (see Table 3).

The extent of absorption of DRSP, however, remained unchanged. In contrast, the extent of absorption of EE was reduced by about 20% under fed conditions. Distribution DRSP and EE serum concentrations decline in two phases. The apparent volume of distribution of DRSP is approximately 4 L/kg and that of EE is reported to be approximately 4 to 5 L/kg. DRSP does not bind to SHBG or corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) but binds about 97% to other serum proteins. Multiple dosing over 3 cycles resulted in no change in the free fraction (as measured at trough concentrations). EE is reported to be highly but non-specifically bound to serum albumin (approximately 98.5 %) and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of both SHBG and CBG. EE induced effects on SHBG and CBG were not affected by variation of the DRSP dosage in the range of 2 to 3 mg. Metabolism The two main metabolites of DRSP found in human plasma were identified to be the acid form of DRSP generated by opening of the lactone ring and the 4,5-dihydrodrospirenone-3-sulfate, formed by reduction and subsequent sulfation. These metabolites were shown not to be pharmacologically active. Drospirenone is also subject to oxidative metabolism catalyzed by CYP3A4. EE has been reported to be subject to significant gut and hepatic first-pass metabolism. Metabolism of EE and its oxidative metabolites occur primarily by conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. CYP3A4 in the liver is responsible for the 2-hydroxylation which is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion. Excretion DRSP serum concentrations are characterized by a terminal disposition phase half-life of approximately 30 hours after both single and multiple dose regimens. Excretion of DRSP was nearly complete after ten days and amounts excreted were slightly higher in feces compared to urine. DRSP was extensively metabolized and only trace amounts of unchanged DRSP were excreted in urine and feces. At least 20 different metabolites were observed in urine and feces. About 38 to 47% of the metabolites in urine were glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In feces, about 17 to 20% of the metabolites were excreted as glucuronides and sulfates. For EE the terminal disposition phase half-life has been reported to be approximately 24 hours. EE is not excreted unchanged. EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Use in Specific Populations Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy of Jasmiel has been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated. Geriatric Use: Jasmiel has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population. Race: No clinically significant difference was observed between the pharmacokinetics of DRSP or EE in Japanese versus Caucasian women (age 25 to 35) when 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE was administered daily for 21 days. Other ethnic groups have not been specifically studied. Renal Impairment: Jasmiel is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of DRSP (3 mg daily for 14 days) and the effect of DRSP on serum potassium concentrations were investigated in three separate groups of female subjects (n=28, age 30 to 65). All subjects were on a low potassium diet. During the study, 7 subjects continued the use of potassium-sparing drugs for the treatment of their underlying illness. On the 14th day (steady-state) of DRSP treatment, the serum DRSP concentrations in the group with CLcr of 50 to 79 mL/min were comparable to those in the control group with CLcr \u2265 80 mL/min. The serum DRSP concentrations were on average 37% higher in the group with CLcr of 30 to 49 mL/min compared to those in the control group. DRSP treatment did not show any clinically significant effect on serum potassium concentration. Although hyperkalemia was not observed in the study, in five of the seven subjects who continued use of potassium-sparing drugs during the study, mean serum potassium concentrations increased by up to 0.33 mEq/L. [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) .] Hepatic Impairment: Jasmiel is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease. The mean exposure to DRSP in women with moderate liver impairment is approximately three times higher than the exposure in women with normal liver function. Jasmiel has not been studied in women with severe hepatic impairment. [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) .] Drug Interactions Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with oral contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in 20 premenopausal women, co-administration of a DRSP (3 mg)/EE (0.02 mg) COC with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) for 10 days increased the AUC (0 to 24h) of DRSP and EE by 2.68-fold (90% CI: 2.44, 2.95) and 1.40-fold (90% CI: 1.31, 1.49), respectively. The increases in C max were 1.97-fold (90% CI: 1.79, 2.17) and 1.39-fold (90% CI: 1.28, 1.52) for DRSP and EE, respectively. Although no clinically relevant effects on safety or laboratory parameters including serum potassium were observed, this study only assessed subjects for 10 days. The clinical impact for a patient taking a DRSP-containing COC concomitantly with chronic use of a CYP3A4/5 inhibitor is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . HIV/HCV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro , EE is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 as well as a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8, and CYP2J2. Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic CYP enzymes have been investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies. In in vitro studies DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women [including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype] the daily oral administration of 3 mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the oral clearance of omeprazole (40 mg, single oral dose) and the CYP2C19 product 5-hydroxy omeprazole. Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found. These results demonstrate that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in vivo . Two additional clinical drug-drug interaction studies using simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrates for CYP3A4 were each performed in 24 healthy postmenopausal women. The results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steady state DRSP concentrations achieved after administration of 3 mg DRSP/day. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Interactions With Drugs That Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Jasmiel with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . A drug-drug interaction study of DRSP 3 mg/estradiol (E2) 1 mg versus placebo was performed in 24 mildly hypertensive postmenopausal women taking enalapril maleate 10 mg twice daily. Potassium concentrations were obtained every other day for a total of 2 weeks in all subjects. Mean serum potassium concentrations in the DRSP/E2 treatment group relative to baseline were 0.22 mEq/L higher than those in the placebo group. Serum potassium concentrations also were measured at multiple time points over 24 hours at baseline and on Day 14. On Day 14, the ratios for serum potassium C max and AUC in the DRSP/E2 group to those in the placebo group were 0.955 (90% CI: 0.914, 0.999) and 1.010 (90% CI: 0.944, 1.08), respectively. No patient in either treatment group developed hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentrations > 5.5 mEq/L)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Afaxys Pharma, LLC"], "effective_time": "20240514", "product_ndc": ["50102-240"], "brand_name": ["Jasmiel"]}
