Faricimab-svoa has a total molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture. VABYSMO (faricimab-svoa) injection is a sterile, clear to opalescent, colorless to brownish-yellow solution in a single-dose prefilled glass syringe or glass vial for intravitreal administration.

The product does not contain an anti-microbial preservative."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Faricimab is a humanized bispecific antibody that acts through inhibition of two pathways by binding to VEGF-A and Ang-2. By inhibiting VEGF-A, faricimab suppresses endothelial cell proliferation, neovascularization and vascular permeability. By inhibiting Ang-2, faricimab is thought to promote vascular stability and desensitize blood vessels to the effects of VEGF-A. Ang-2 levels are increased in some patients with nAMD, DME, and RVO. The contribution of Ang-2 inhibition to the treatment effect and clinical response for nAMD, DME, and RVO has yet to be established. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increased retinal thickness, assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT), is associated with nAMD, DME and macular edema following RVO. Leakage of blood and fluid from choroidal neovascularization, assessed by fluorescein angiography, is associated with nAMD. Reductions in CST were observed across all treatment arms throughout the six Phase 3 studies in nAMD, DME, and RVO. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption/Distribution Maximum faricimab plasma concentrations (Cmax) are estimated to occur approximately 2 days post-dose. Mean (\u00b1SD) free faricimab (unbound to VEGF-A and Ang-2) plasma Cmax are estimated to be 0.23 (0.07) mcg/mL and 0.22 (0.07) mcg/mL in nAMD and in DME patients, respectively. After repeated intravitreal administrations, mean plasma free faricimab trough concentrations are predicted to be 0.002-0.003 mcg/mL for every 8 weeks (Q8W) dosing and 0.021-0.029 mcg/mL for every 4 weeks (Q4W) dosing. Although not directly measured in the vitreous, no accumulation of faricimab is expected in the vitreous and no accumulation has been observed in plasma when faricimab has been administered as repeat doses in the vitreous. Metabolism/Elimination Metabolism and elimination of faricimab has not been fully characterized. Faricimab is expected to be catabolized in lysosomes to small peptides and amino acids, which may be excreted renally, in a similar manner to the elimination of endogenous IgG. The estimated mean apparent systemic half-life of faricimab is approximately 7.5 days. Specific Populations The systemic pharmacokinetics of faricimab were not influenced by gender, race, or mild to severe renal impairment (i.e., estimated normalized creatinine clearance by Cockroft-Gault equation: 15 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). The effect of severe renal impairment or any degree of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of VABYSMO is unknown. No special dosage modification is required for any of the populations that have been studied (e.g., elderly, gender, race). Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the pharmacokinetics of faricimab are comparable in nAMD, DME, and RVO patients. 12.6 Immunogenicity The immunogenicity of VABYSMO was evaluated in plasma samples. The immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to VABYSMO in immunoassays. The detection of an immune response is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays used, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to VABYSMO with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. There is a potential for an immune response in patients treated with VABYSMO. In the nAMD, DME, and RVO studies, the pre-treatment incidence of anti-faricimab antibodies was approximately 0.8 to 1.8%. After initiation of dosing, the incidence of anti-faricimab antibodies was approximately 8% to 10.4% in patients treated with VABYSMO across studies.
