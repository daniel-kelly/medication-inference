Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some subjects in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan's development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following nasal administration of 10 mg TOSYMRA in 73 healthy subjects, the relative bioavailability of TOSYMRA was approximately 87% [90% confidence interval (CI) 82 to 94] of that obtained following 4 mg subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan. The relative bioavailability of TOSYMRA was 58% [90% CI 55 to 62] following 6 mg subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan. Absorption Peak plasma concentration of sumatriptan was observed in a median time of 10 minutes (range 5 to 23 minutes). After single nasal administration of the 10 mg dose, the mean (CV%) C max and AUC were 51.8 ng/mL (58%) and 60.70 ng\u2219hr/mL (42%), respectively. Distribution Sumatriptan protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL, is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age: 33 years, mean weight: 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 \u00b1 8 liters and the distribution half-life was 15 \u00b1 2 minutes. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan following administration of TOSYMRA is 2.44 \u00b1 1.00 hours. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Excretion After a single 6 mg subcutaneous dose, 22% \u00b1 4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38% \u00b1 7% as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194 \u00b1 149 mL/min and the terminal half-life was 115 \u00b1 19 minutes. Specific Populations Age The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of TOSYMRA has not been evaluated. The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls.

Azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H1-receptor antagonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine hydrochloride does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2\u00ad-3 hours. Azelastine hydrochloride administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine hydrochloride to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20 to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine hydrochloride is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions Erythromycin No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co\u00ad-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT 1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT 1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. Current theories proposed to explain the etiology of migraine headache suggest that symptoms are due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Absorption Zolmitriptan nasal spray is rapidly absorbed via the nasopharynx as detected in a Photon Emission Tomography (PET) study using 11 C zolmitriptan. The mean relative bioavailability of the nasal spray formulation is 102%, compared with the oral tablet. Zolmitriptan was detected in plasma by 5 minutes and peak plasma concentration generally was achieved by 3 hours. The time at which maximum plasma concentrations were observed was similar after single (1 day) or multiple (4 days) nasal dosing. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan are sustained for 4 to 6 hours after dosing. Zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite display linear kinetics after single or multiple doses of zolmitriptan nasal spray over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics of the N-desmethyl metabolite are similar to that of zolmitriptan for all nasal spray dosages. The N-desmethyl metabolite is detected in plasma by 15 minutes and peak plasma concentration is generally achieved by 3 hours after administration. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. Distribution Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10-1000 ng/mL. The mean apparent volume of distribution for zolmitriptan nasal spray formulation is 8.4 L/kg. Metabolism Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite such that the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT 1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after zolmitriptan administration. Excretion The mean elimination half-life for zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite following single or multiple nasal spray administration are approximately 3 hours, similar to the half-life values seen after oral tablet administration. In a study with orally administered zolmitriptan, total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. In urine, unchanged zolmitriptan and N-desmethyl metabolite accounted for 8% and 4% of the dose, respectively, whereas the inactive indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites accounted for 31% and 7% of the dose, respectively. Mean total plasma clearance for zolmitriptan nasal spray is 25.9 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65-76 yrs) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18-39 yrs). Sex: Mean plasma concentrations of orally administered zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males. Race: There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of orally administered zolmitriptan in Japanese and Caucasians. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. After orally dosing zolmitriptan, renal clearance was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr \u2265 5 \u2264 25 mL/min) compared with the normal group (Clcr \u2265 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in the moderately renally impaired group (Clcr \u2265 26 \u2264 50 mL/min). Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan nasal spray has not been evaluated. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean C max , T max , and AUC of zolmitriptan dosed orally were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg zolmitriptan dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Hypertensive Patients: No differences in the pharmacokinetics of oral zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls. Drug Interactions All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. Eight drug interaction studies have been performed with zolmitriptan tablets and one study (xylometazoline) was performed with nasal spray. Xylometazoline: An in vivo drug interaction study with zolmitriptan nasal spray indicated that 1 spray (100 \u03bcL dose) of xylometazoline (0.1% w/v), a decongestant, administered 30 minutes prior to a 5 mg nasal dose of zolmitriptan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan. Fluoxetine: The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pre-treatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). MAO Inhibitors: Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice-daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both C max and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the C max and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Propranolol: C max and AUC of zolmitriptan increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). C max and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no interactive effects on blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen: A single 1g dose of acetaminophen does not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan delayed the T max of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide: A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives: Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean C max and AUC of zolmitriptan were 30% and 50% higher, respectively, and T max was delayed by one-half hour in females taking oral contraceptives compared to females not taking oral contraceptives.

The therapeutic activity of dihydroergotamine in migraine is generally attributed to the agonist effects at 5-HT 1D receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Significant elevation in blood pressure has been reported in patients treated with dihydroergotamine with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Dihydroergotamine possesses oxytocic properties [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following ATZUMI administration, the mean maximum plasma concentration was 2.1 ng/mL, and the median time from dosing to maximum plasma concentration was approximately 0.5 hours. Distribution Dihydroergotamine is 93% plasma protein bound. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 800 liters. Elimination The mean apparent half-life of dihydroergotamine following nasal administration of ATZUMI in healthy subjects is approximately 13 hours. Metabolism Four dihydroergotamine mesylate metabolites have been identified in human plasma following oral administration. The major metabolite, 8'-\u03b2-hydroxydihydroergotamine, exhibits affinity equivalent to its parent for adrenergic and 5-HT 1 receptors and demonstrates equivalent potency in several venoconstrictor activity models, in vivo and in vitro. The other metabolites, (i.e., dihydrolysergic acid, dihydrolysergic amide) and a metabolite formed by oxidative opening of the proline ring are of minor importance. Following nasal administration of ATZUMI, the 8'-\u03b2-hydroxydihydroergotamine metabolite plasma AUC was approximately 16% of the plasma AUC of dihydroergotamine, and the mean C max (5.7% of parent) was below the minimal concentrations required for receptor binding for adrenergic and 5-HT 1 receptors. Excretion The major excretory route of dihydroergotamine is via the bile in the feces. The total body clearance following ATZUMI administration is 1.5 L/min which reflects mainly hepatic clearance. The renal clearance (0.1 L/min) is unaffected by the route of dihydroergotamine administration based on other dihydroergotamine products. Specific Populations No studies have been conducted on the effect of renal or hepatic impairment, gender, race, ethnicity, or pregnancy on dihydroergotamine pharmacokinetics [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Drug Interaction Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors In a drug interaction study, administration of ATZUMI with itraconazole increased dihydroergotamine plasma exposure by 14% for C max and 19% for AUC while the plasma exposures (C max and AUC 0-inf ) of 8'-\u03b2-hydroxy dihydroergotamine (8'-OH-DHE, active metabolite) were increased by approximately 4-fold and 3-fold, respectively [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Other Drugs The pharmacokinetics of dihydroergotamine did not appear to be significantly affected by the concomitant use of a local vasoconstrictor. Multiple oral doses of the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, used for preventive treatment of migraine, had no significant influence on the C max , T max or AUC of dihydroergotamine doses up to 4 mg [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ].

Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. The precise mechanism through which fluticasone propionate affects rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. In 7 trials in adults, fluticasone propionate nasal spray has decreased nasal mucosal eosinophils in 66% of patients (35% for placebo) and basophils in 39% of patients (28% for placebo). The direct relationship of these findings to long-term symptom relief is not known. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics HPA Axis Effect : The potential systemic effects of fluticasone propionate nasal spray on the HPA axis were evaluated. Fluticasone propionate nasal spray given as 200 mcg once daily or 400 mcg twice daily was compared with placebo or oral prednisone 7.5 or 15 mg given in the morning. Fluticasone propionate nasal spray at either dosage for 4 weeks did not affect the adrenal response to 6-hour cosyntropin stimulation, while both dosages of oral prednisone significantly reduced the response to cosyntropin. Cardiac Electrophysiology : A study specifically designed to evaluate the effect of fluticasone propionate nasal spray on the QT interval has not been conducted. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of fluticasone propionate nasal spray is due to the parent drug, fluticasone propionate. Due to the low bioavailability by the intranasal route, the majority of the pharmacokinetic data was obtained via other routes of administration. Absorption : Indirect calculations indicate that fluticasone propionate delivered by the intranasal route has an absolute bioavailability averaging less than 2%. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate is negligible (<1%), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. After intranasal treatment of patients with rhinitis for 3 weeks, fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations were above the level of detection (50 pg/mL) only when recommended doses were exceeded and then only in occasional samples at low plasma levels. Distribution : Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 99%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Elimination : Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. The total blood clearance of fluticasone propionate is high (average: 1,093 mL/min), with renal clearance accounting for less than 0.02% of the total. Metabolism : The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Excretion : Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Special Populations : Fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not studied in any special populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained. Drug Interactions : Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 : Ritonavir : Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ritonavir, is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range: 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC (0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022h/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC (0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range: 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022h/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in serum cortisol AUC. Ketoconazole : Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45% decrease in plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol.

The dose normalized relative bioavailability of one dose (2 mg or 4 mg) or two doses (4 mg or 8 mg) of naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray as compared to the 0.4 mg dose of naloxone hydrochloride administered by intramuscular injection was 52%, 44%, 54%, and 43%, respectively. Distribution Following parenteral administration, naloxone is distributed in the body and readily crosses the placenta. Plasma protein binding occurs but is relatively weak. Plasma albumin is the major binding constituent, but significant binding of naloxone also occurs to plasma constituents other than albumin. It is not known whether naloxone is excreted into human milk. Elimination Following a single intranasal administration of naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray (2 mg or 4 mg dose of naloxone hydrochloride), the mean plasma half-life of naloxone in healthy adults was approximately 1.85 (33% CV) hours and 2.08 (30% CV) hours; respectively, which was longer than that observed after administrations of a 0.4 mg naloxone hydrochloride intramuscular injection, where the half-life was 1.24 hours (26% CV).

It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide, and slightly soluble in methanol and 95% ethanol. Fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 50 mcg is an aqueous suspension of microfine fluticasone propionate for topical administration to the nasal mucosa by means of a metering, atomizing spray pump. Fluticasone propionate nasal spray also contains 0.02% w/w benzalkonium chloride, dextrose, microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose sodium, 0.25% w/w phenylethyl alcohol and polysorbate 80 and has a pH between 5 and 7. After initial priming, each actuation delivers 50 mcg of fluticasone propionate in 100 mg of formulation through the nasal adapter. image-chemical-structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic, trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. The precise mechanism through which fluticasone propionate affects rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. In 7 trials in adults, fluticasone propionate nasal spray has decreased nasal mucosal eosinophils in 66% of patients (35% for placebo) and basophils in 39% of patients (28% for placebo). The direct relationship of these findings to long-term symptom relief is not known. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics HPA Axis Effect : The potential systemic effects of fluticasone propionate nasal spray on the HPA axis were evaluated. Fluticasone propionate nasal spray given as 200 mcg once daily or 400 mcg twice daily was compared with placebo or oral prednisone 7.5 or 15 mg given in the morning. Fluticasone propionate nasal spray at either dosage for 4 weeks did not affect the adrenal response to 6-hour cosyntropin stimulation, while both dosages of oral prednisone significantly reduced the response to cosyntropin. Cardiac Electrophysiology : A study specifically designed to evaluate the effect of fluticasone propionate nasal spray on the QT interval has not been conducted. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of fluticasone propionate nasal spray is due to the parent drug, fluticasone propionate. Due to the low bioavailability by the intranasal route, the majority of the pharmacokinetic data was obtained via other routes of administration. Absorption : Indirect calculations indicate that fluticasone propionate delivered by the intranasal route has an absolute bioavailability averaging less than 2%. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate is negligible (<1%), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. After intranasal treatment of patients with rhinitis for 3 weeks, fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations were above the level of detection (50 pg/mL) only when recommended doses were exceeded and then only in occasional samples at low plasma levels. Distribution : Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 99%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Elimination : Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. The total blood clearance of fluticasone propionate is high (average: 1,093 mL/min), with renal clearance accounting for less than 0.02% of the total. Metabolism : The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Excretion : Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Special Populations : Fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not studied in any special populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained. Drug Interactions : Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 : Ritonavir : Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ritonavir, is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range: 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC (0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022h/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC (0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range: 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022h/mL (range: 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022h/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in serum cortisol AUC. Ketoconazole : Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45% decrease in plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. Erythromycin : In a multiple-dose drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg 3 times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics."], "manufacturer_name": ["Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc."], "substance_name": ["FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE"], "effective_time": "20220215", "product_ndc": ["0054-3270"], "brand_name": ["Fluticasone Propionate"]}

No clinically relevant QTc prolongation was observed at the highest clinically relevant concentrations with a single therapeutic dose. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of GOPRELTO (cocaine hydrochloride) nasal solution have been assessed in 74 healthy adult subjects across 4 studies. Following intranasal application of two 40 mg pledgets applied to each nasal cavity (160 mg cocaine hydrochloride total dose) for 20 minutes, the geometric mean (SD) cocaine C max was 43.2 (1.73) ng/mL. The median (range) time to peak plasma concentration (t max ) was 0.42 (0.25 \u2013 1.75) hours after pledget application. Distribution Cocaine has been described in literature as approximately 84 \u2013 92% bound to human plasma proteins, binding primarily to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin. In studies with GOPRELTO, the apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of cocaine after intranasal administration is 3,877 \u00b1 1,266 L. Elimination Metabolism Cocaine has been described in literature to be primarily metabolized and inactivated by nonenzymatic ester hydrolysis and hepatic carboxylesterase 1 to form benzoylecgonine (BE), and by plasma cholinesterase and hepatic carboxylesterase 2 to form ecgonine methyl ester (EME). In human liver microsomes, cocaine undergoes CYP3A4 mediated N-demethylation to produce a minor metabolite, norcocaine, which is pharmacologically active. Excretion Cocaine has been described in literature to be primarily eliminated by biotransformation to inactive metabolites, BE and EME. Less than 10% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. BE and EME are both predominantly excreted by the kidneys. In studies with GOPRELTO, 0-32 hour urinary recoveries of cocaine, BE, and EME as a percentage of dose were approximately 0.1%, 2.0%, and 1.0%, respectively. The mean elimination half-life of cocaine was 1.0 to 1.7 hours; with longer plasma sampling (32 hours) and a highly sensitive assay, mean half-life values of 5.0 to 8.0 hours were observed at very low plasma concentrations. The apparent clearance of cocaine after intranasal administration of GOPRELTO (CL/F) is 3096 \u00b1 1276 L/h. Specific Populations In studies with GOPRELTO, cocaine exposure (i.e., C max , AUC last , and AUC inf ) was slightly higher in females than males whereas tmax and half-life were similar in males and females. GOPRELTO pharmacokinetics are not affected by age or weight. Renal Impairment In a pharmacokinetic study of GOPRELTO in subjects with normal and severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m2), mean AUC and Cmax were slightly higher in subjects with severe renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function and clearance was slightly lower [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Hepatic Impairment In a pharmacokinetic study of GOPRELTO in subjects with normal, Child-Pugh Class B, and Child-Pugh Grade C hepatic impairment, there was a minimal effect of hepatic impairment on cocaine C max . In moderately impaired subjects (n=9) there was a higher than two-fold increase in AUC (79.2 ng.h/mL in normal subjects to 225 ng.h/mL in Child-Pugh Grade B subjects) and the clearance was reduced by more than half (1735 L/h in normal 629 L/h in Child-Pugh Grade B subjects). In severely impaired subjects (n=3) there was an eighty percent increase in AUC (79.2 ng.h/mL in normal subjects to 142 ng.h/mL in Child-Pugh Grade C subjects) and the clearance was reduced to half (1735 L/h in normal 959 L/h in Child-Pugh Grade C subjects) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug Interaction Studies Cocaine has been found to be a CYP2D6 inhibitor in in-vitro studies employing human liver microsomes. In vitro transporter inhibition studies also found cocaine to be an inhibitor of OCT2. However, the relatively low plasma concentrations of cocaine resulting from therapeutic doses of GOPRELTO are not expected to raise significant drug-drug interaction concerns. Disulfiram It has been reported in the published literature that disulfiram treatment increased plasma cocaine exposure, including both AUC and C max , by several fold after acute intranasal cocaine administration.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zavegepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The relationship between pharmacodynamic activity and the mechanism by which zavegepant exerts its clinical effects is unknown. No clinically relevant differences in resting blood pressure were observed when zavegepant was concomitantly administered with sumatriptan (12 mg subcutaneous, given as two 6 mg doses separated by one hour) compared with sumatriptan alone to healthy volunteers. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose up to 4 times the recommended daily dose, zavegepant does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Peak plasma concentration of zavegepant was observed at approximately 30 minutes after a single 10 mg dose of the nasal spray. After nasal spray administration of zavegepant, the absolute bioavailability is approximately 5%. Zavegepant given as a single dose of the nasal spray displays slightly less than dose-proportional pharmacokinetics up to 40 mg (approximately 4 times the recommended dosage of 10 mg). Following once daily dosing of ZAVZPRET for 14 days there was no evidence of zavegepant accumulation. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution of intranasal zavegepant is approximately 1774 L. Plasma protein binding of zavegepant is approximately 90%. Elimination Metabolism Zavegepant is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6, in vitro. After single IV dose of 5 mg [ 14 C]-zavegepant, unchanged zavegepant was the most prevalent (approximately 90%) circulating component in the human plasma. No major metabolites (i.e., greater than 10%) of zavegepant were detected in plasma. Excretion The effective half-life of zavegepant following a 10 mg dose of the nasal spray is 6.55 hours. The mean apparent clearance of intranasal zavegepant is 266 L/h. Zavegepant is excreted mostly via the biliary/fecal route, while the renal route is a minor route of elimination. Following a single intravenous dose of 5 mg [ 14 C]-zavegepant to healthy male subjects, approximately 80% and 11% of the dose was recovered as unchanged zavegepant in feces and urine, respectively. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment In a dedicated clinical study comparing the pharmacokinetics of zavegepant in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) to that of normal subjects (matched healthy controls), zavegepant C max was 16% higher and AUC was 1.9-fold higher in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. These changes in exposures are not expected to be clinically significant, based on clinical safety experience and minimal accumulation of drug exposures. The impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) on the pharmacokinetics of zavegepant was not studied [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment The renal route plays a minor role in the clearance of zavegepant. No clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of zavegepant is expected in subjects with estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) 30 mL/min or greater. In patients with CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min, accumulation of uremic solutes can cause an increase in zavegepant exposures by inhibiting OATP transporters. Zavegepant has not been studied in patients with CLcr less than 15 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Other Specific Populations Age, sex, race, ethnicity, and body weight did not show clinically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of zavegepant. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies Enzymes Zavegepant is a substrate of CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2D6. Zavegepant is not an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4, or an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 2C19, 2B6, 2D6, 2C8, and 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. Transporters Zavegepant is a substrate for OATP1B3 and NTCP (see In Vivo studies ) . Zavegepant is also a substrate for the transporters P-gp, MATE1, and MATE2-K. Considering the minor contribution of the renal pathway in the clearance of zavegepant, coadministration of zavegepant with inhibitors of P-gp, MATE1, and MATE2-K inhibitors is not expected to result in a clinically significant effect on zavegepant pharmacokinetics. Zavegepant is not a substrate for BCRP, OATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, BSEP, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP4. Zavegepant is an inhibitor of OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K, but drug interactions for ZAVZPRET are not expected at clinically relevant concentrations. Zavegepant is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. In Vivo Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant administration of a single dose of 10 mg ZAVZPRET with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor), at steady state did not result in a clinically relevant effect on the exposures of zavegepant. OATP1B3 or NTCP Inhibitors Concomitant administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg zavegepant with rifampin (an OATP1B3, NTCP inhibitor and a strong CYP3A inducer), at steady state resulted in increased zavegepant exposure (AUC by 2.3-fold and C max by 2.2-fold). The observed change in zavegepant exposures is a composite effect of inhibition of OATP1B3 and NTCP transporters as well as induction of CYP3A enzymes. Concomitant administration of ZAVZPRET with inhibitors of OATP1B3 or NTCP transporters may result in a significant increase in zavegepant exposure [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . OATP1B3 or NTCP Inducers Concomitant administration of ZAVZPRET with inducers of OATP1B3 or NTCP transporters has not been studied. However, since zavegepant is a substrate of OATP1B3 and NTCP, concomitant administration with inducers of these transporters may result in decreased zavegepant exposure [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Intranasal Decongestants The effect of concomitant intranasal decongestants on the pharmacokinetics of zavegepant nasal spray has not been evaluated. Concomitant administration of intranasal decongestants may decrease the systemic exposure of zavegepant and potentially the efficacy of zavegepant [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] .

Structure.jpg"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H1-receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H1-receptor antagonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine hydrochloride does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2\u2011-3 hours. Azelastine hydrochloride administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine hydrochloride to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20 to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine hydrochloride is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions Erythromycin No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co\u2011-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine.

The antihistaminic activity of olopatadine has been documented in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a placebo-controlled cardiovascular safety study, 32 healthy volunteers received 20 mg oral solution of olopatadine twice daily for 14 days (8-fold greater daily dose than the recommended daily nasal dose). The mean QTcF (QT corrected by Fridericia\u2019s correction method for heart rate) change from baseline was -2.7 msec and -3.8 msec for olopatadine, and placebo, respectively. In this study, 8 subjects treated with olopatadine had a QTcF change from baseline of 30-60 msec, 1 subject had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec. Eight subjects treated with placebo had a QTcF change from baseline of 30-60 msec, no subjects had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec. In a 12-month study in 429 perennial allergic rhinitis patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily, no evidence of any effect of olopatadine hydrochloride on QT prolongation was observed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of olopatadine were studied after administration by the nasal, oral, intravenous, and topical ocular routes. Olopatadine exhibited linear pharmacokinetics across the routes studied over a large dose range. Absorption Healthy Subjects: Olopatadine was absorbed with individual peak plasma concentrations observed between 30 minutes and 1 hour after twice daily intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray. The mean ( \u00b1 SD) steady-state peak plasma concentration (C max ) of olopatadine was 16.0 \u00b1 8.99 ng/mL. Systemic exposure as indexed by area under the curve (AUC 0-12 ) averaged 66.0 \u00b1 26.8 ng\u00b7h/mL. The average absolute bioavailability of intranasal olopatadine is 57%. The mean accumulation ratio following multiple intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was about 1.3. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Patients: Systemic exposure of olopatadine in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients after twice daily intranasal administration of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray was comparable to that observed in healthy subjects. Olopatadine was absorbed with peak plasma concentrations observed between 15 minutes and 2 hours. The mean steady-state C max was 23.3 \u00b1 6.2 ng/mL and AUC 0-12 averaged 78.0 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL. Distribution The protein binding of olopatadine was moderate at approximately 55% in human serum, and independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL. Olopatadine was bound predominately to human serum albumin. Elimination The plasma elimination half-life of olopatadine is 8 to 12 hours. Olopatadine is mainly eliminated through urinary excretion. Approximately 70% of a [ 14 C] olopatadine hydrochloride oral dose was recovered in urine with 17% in the feces. Of the drug-related material recovered within the first 24 hours in the urine, 86% was unchanged olopatadine with the balance comprised of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. Metabolism Olopatadine is not extensively metabolized. Based on plasma metabolite profiles following oral administration of [ 14 C] olopatadine, at least six minor metabolites circulate in human plasma. Olopatadine accounts for 77% of peak plasma total radioactivity and all metabolites amounted to < 6% combined. Two of these have been identified as the olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine. In in vitro studies with cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP) and flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO), N-desmethyl olopatadine (Ml) formation was catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4, while olopatadine N-oxide (M3) was primarily catalyzed by FMO1 and FMO3. Olopatadine at concentrations up to 33,900 ng/mL did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. The potential for olopatadine and its metabolites to act as inducers of CYP enzymes has not been evaluated. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment No specific pharmacokinetic study examining the effect of hepatic impairment was conducted. Since metabolism of olopatadine is a minor route of elimination, no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is warranted in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with Renal Impairment The mean C max values for olopatadine following single nasal doses were not markedly different between healthy subjects (18.1 ng/mL) and patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment (range 15.5 to 21.6 ng/mL). The mean plasma AUC 0-12 was 2-fold higher in patients with severe impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). In these patients, peak steady-state plasma concentrations of olopatadine are approximately 10-fold lower than those observed after higher 20 mg oral doses, twice daily, which were well-tolerated. These findings indicate that no adjustment of the dosing regimen of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray is warranted in patients with renal impairment. Male and Female Patients The mean systemic exposure (C max and AUC 0-12 ) in female SAR patients following multiple administration of olopatadine was 40% and 27% higher, respectively than those values observed in male SAR patients. Racial or Ethnic Groups The effects of race on olopatadine pharmacokinetics have not been adequately investigated. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine in patients 6 through 11 years of age were characterized using data from 42 pediatric patients administered olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray, one spray per nostril twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max (15.4 \u00b1 7.3 ng/mL) of olopatadine was approximately 2-fold less than was comparable to that observed in adults (78.0 \u00b1 13.9 ng\u00b7h/mL). The C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide were comparable to that observed in adults. The C max and AUC 0-12 of N-desmethyl olopatadine are approximately 18% and 37% higher than that observed in adults, respectively. Pediatric Patients 2 to 5 Years of Age The systemic pharmacokinetics of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide, and N-desmethyl olopatadine were characterized using population pharmacokinetic methods applied to sparse data (approximately 5 samples per patient) obtained from 66 pediatric patients (2 to less than 6 years of age) administered one-half the recommended adult dose (one spray per nostril) of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray twice daily for a minimum of 14 days. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine were 13.4 \u00b1 4.6 ng/mL and 75.0 \u00b1 26.4 ng\u2022hr/mL respectively. The mean C max and AUC 0-12 of olopatadine N-oxide and N-desmethyl olopatadine were similar to that of patients 6 to 11 years of age. Drug Interaction Studies Drug interactions with inhibitors of liver enzymes are not anticipated because olopatadine is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Olopatadine did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4.

Chemically, naloxone hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt of 17-Allyl-4,5\u03b1-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxymorphinan-6-one hydrochloride with the following structure: C 19 H 21 NO 4 \u2219 HCl M.W. 363.84 Naloxone hydrochloride, an opioid antagonist, occurs as a white to slightly off-white powder, and is soluble in water, in dilute acids, and in strong alkali; slightly soluble in alcohol; practically insoluble in ether and in chloroform. Each NARCAN Nasal Spray contains a 2 mg or 4 mg single dose of naloxone hydrochloride (equivalent to 1.8 mg or 3.6 mg of naloxone) in a 0.1 mL (100 microliter) aqueous solution. Inactive ingredients include benzalkonium chloride (preservative), disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (stabilizer), sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid to adjust pH, and purified water. The pH range is 3.5 to 5.5. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Naloxone hydrochloride is an opioid antagonist that antagonizes opioid effects by competing for the same receptor sites. Naloxone hydrochloride reverses the effects of opioids, including respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. It can also reverse the psychotomimetic and dysphoric effects of agonist-antagonists such as pentazocine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics When naloxone hydrochloride is administered intravenously, the onset of action is generally apparent within two minutes. The time to onset of action is shorter for intravenous compared to subcutaneous or intramuscular routes of administration. The duration of action is dependent upon the dose and route of administration of naloxone hydrochloride. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a pharmacokinetic study in 30 healthy adult subjects, the relative bioavailability (BA) of one nasal spray in one nostril, consisting of a 2 mg total dose (0.1 mL of 20 mg/mL naloxone hydrochloride solution) and a 4 mg total dose (0.1 mL of 40 mg/mL naloxone hydrochloride solution), and two nasal sprays administered as one nasal spray in each nostril, consisting of a 4 mg total dose (0.1 mL of 20 mg/mL naloxone hydrochloride solution in each nostril) and an 8 mg total dose (0.1 mL of 40 mg/mL naloxone hydrochloride solution in each nostril), were compared to a single dose of 0.4 mg naloxone hydrochloride intramuscular injection. For intranasal administration, the subjects were instructed not to breathe through the nose during administration of the nasal spray, and remained fully supine for approximately one hour post-dose. For intramuscular administration, naloxone was administered as a single injection in the gluteus maximus muscle. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in the study are shown in Table 1.

The dose normalized relative bioavailability of one dose (2 mg or 4 mg) or two doses (4 mg or 8 mg) of NARCAN Nasal Spray as compared to the 0.4 mg dose of naloxone hydrochloride administered by intramuscular injection was 52%, 44%, 54%, and 43%, respectively. Distribution Following parenteral administration, naloxone is distributed in the body and readily crosses the placenta. Plasma protein binding occurs but is relatively weak. Plasma albumin is the major binding constituent, but significant binding of naloxone also occurs to plasma constituents other than albumin. It is not known whether naloxone is excreted into human milk. Elimination Following a single intranasal administration of NARCAN Nasal Spray (2 mg or 4 mg dose of naloxone hydrochloride), the mean plasma half-life of naloxone in healthy adults was approximately 1.85 (33% CV) hours and 2.08 (30% CV) hours; respectively, which was longer than that observed after administrations of a 0.4 mg naloxone hydrochloride intramuscular injection, where the half-life was 1.24 hours (26% CV). In a neonatal study of naloxone hydrochloride injection, the mean (\u00b1 SD) plasma half-life was observed to be 3.1 (\u00b1 0.5) hours. Metabolism Naloxone hydrochloride is metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronide conjugation, with naloxone-3-glucoronide as the major metabolite. Excretion After an oral or intravenous dose, about 25-40% of naloxone is excreted as metabolites in urine within 6 hours, about 50% in 24 hours, and 60-70% in 72 hours.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ciclesonide is a pro-drug that is enzymatically hydrolyzed to a pharmacologically active metabolite, C21-desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-ciclesonide or RM1) following intranasal application. Des-ciclesonide has anti-inflammatory activity with affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor that is 120-times higher than the parent compound. The precise mechanism through which ciclesonide affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic inflammation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Adrenal Function : In a 6-week trial in adolescents and adults 12-73 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, a daily dose of 200 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray was compared to placebo nasal spray. Dexamethasone 6 mg was used as an active control during the last 4 days of the treatment period. Adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 24-hour serum cortisol levels before and after 6 consecutive weeks of treatment. The difference from placebo for the change from baseline in serum cortisol AUC (0-24) was 10.4 mcg\u2022hour/dL (95% CI: -4.7, 25.5) for 200 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray. The effects observed with the active control (dexamethasone, n=18) validate the sensitivity of the study to assess the effect of ciclesonide on the HPA axis. In a 12-week study in children 6 to 11 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, daily doses of 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray were compared to placebo nasal spray. Adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 24-hour urinary-free cortisol (in 32 to 44 patients per group) and morning plasma cortisol levels (in 45 to 61 patients per group) before and after 12 consecutive weeks of treatment. The ciclesonide-treated groups had a numerically greater decline in 24-hour urinary-free cortisol compared to the placebo-treated group. The differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks were -0.81 (-4.0, 2.4), -0.08 (-3.1, 2.9), and \u20112.11 (\u20115.3, 1.1) mcg/day for 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively. The mean AM plasma cortisol value did not show any consistent treatment effect with differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks of 0.35 (\u20111.4, 2.1), 0.12 (-1.5, 1.7), and -0.38 (-2.1, 1.3) mcg/dL for 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively. In this study, serum was assayed for ciclesonide and des\u2011ciclesonide [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In a 6-week study in children 2 to 5 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, daily doses of 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray were compared to placebo nasal spray. Adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 24-hour urinary-free cortisol (in 15 to 22 patients per group) and morning plasma cortisol levels (in 28 to 30 patients per group) before and after 6 consecutive weeks of treatment. The ciclesonide-treated groups had a numerically greater decline in 24-hour urinary-free cortisol compared to the placebo-treated group. The differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change from baseline to 6 weeks were \u20112.04 (-4.4, 0.3), -1.96 (-4.5, 0.6), and \u20111.76 (\u20114.3, 0.8) mcg/day for the 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively. The plasma cortisol also decreased numerically after treatment with ciclesonide. The differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change in plasma cortisol from baseline to 6 weeks were \u20111.04 (\u20112.7, 0.7), -0.36 (-2.1, 1.4), and \u20110.12 (\u20111.8, 1.6) mcg/dL for the 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively. In this study, serum was assayed for ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption : Ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide have negligible oral bioavailability (both less than 1%) due to low gastrointestinal absorption and high first-pass metabolism. The intranasal administration of ciclesonide at recommended doses results in negligible serum concentrations of ciclesonide. However, the known active metabolite (des-ciclesonide) is detected in the serum of some patients after nasal inhalation of ciclesonide. The bioanalytical assay used has a lower limit of quantification of 25 pg/mL and 10 pg/mL, for ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide, respectively. In healthy adults treated for two weeks with 50 to 800 mcg of ciclesonide nasal spray daily (n=6 in each treatment group), the peak serum concentrations of des-ciclesonide in all subjects were found to be below 30 pg/mL. Of those treated with 800 mcg and 400 mcg daily, 100% and 67% had detectable levels of des\u2011ciclesonide, respectively. With daily doses of 200 mcg or less, detectable serum levels of des-ciclesonide were not observed. The low systemic exposure following ciclesonide nasal spray administration was confirmed in a crossover study in twenty-nine healthy adults. The median C max was less than 10 pg/mL and 602 pg/mL following a single dose of ciclesonide nasal spray (300 mcg) and orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 mcg), respectively. Distribution : Following intravenous administration of 800 mcg of ciclesonide, the volumes of distribution of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide were approximately 2.9 L/kg and 12.1 L/kg, respectively. The percentage of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide bound to human plasma proteins averaged \u2265 99% each, with \u2264 1% of unbound drug detected in the systemic circulation. Des\u2011ciclesonide is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Metabolism : Ciclesonide is hydrolyzed to a biologically active metabolite, des-ciclesonide, by esterases. Des-ciclesonide undergoes further metabolism in the liver to additional metabolites mainly by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isozyme and to a lesser extent by CYP 2D6. The full range of potentially active metabolites of ciclesonide has not been characterized. After intravenous administration of 14 C-ciclesonide, 19.3% of the resulting radioactivity in the plasma is accounted for by ciclesonide or des-ciclesonide; the remainder may be a result of other, as yet, unidentified multiple metabolites. Elimination : Following intravenous administration of 800 mcg of ciclesonide, the clearance values of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide were high (approximately 152 L/h and 228 L/h, respectively). 14 C-labeled ciclesonide was predominantly excreted via the feces after intravenous administration (66%) indicating that excretion through bile is the major route of elimination. Approximately 20% or less of drug-related radioactivity was excreted in the urine. Special Populations : The pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered ciclesonide have not been assessed in patient subpopulations because the resulting blood levels of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide are insufficient for pharmacokinetic calculations. However, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that characteristics of des-ciclesonide after oral inhalation of ciclesonide were not appreciably influenced by a variety of subject characteristics such as body weight, age, race, and gender. Hepatic Impairment : Compared to healthy subjects, the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) in patients with liver impairment increased in the range of 1.4 to 2.7-fold after ex-actuator administration of 1280 mcg ciclesonide via oral inhalation. Dose adjustment in liver impairment is not necessary. Renal Impairment : Studies in renally-impaired patients were not conducted since renal excretion of des-ciclesonide is a minor route of elimination (\u2264 20%). Pediatric : In pediatric subjects treated with 25 to 200 mcg of ciclesonide nasal spray daily, serum concentrations of des-ciclesonide were below 45 pg/mL, with the exception of one value of 64.5 pg/mL. In a 12-week study in children 6 to 11 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, des-ciclesonide was detected in 50% of the subjects treated with 200 mcg and in 5% of those treated with 100 mcg ciclesonide nasal spray daily. In a 6-week study in children 2 to 5 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, des-ciclesonide was detected in 41%, 22%, and 13% of the subjects treated with 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg ciclesonide nasal spray daily, respectively. Drug-Drug Interactions : Based on in vitro studies in human liver microsomes, des-ciclesonide appears to have no inhibitory or induction potential on the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The inhibitory potential of ciclesonide on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes has not been studied. In vitro studies demonstrated that the plasma protein binding of des-ciclesonide was not affected by warfarin or salicylic acid, indicating no potential for protein binding-based drug interactions. In a drug interaction study, co-administration of orally inhaled ciclesonide and oral ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, increased the exposure (AUC) of the active metabolite of ciclesonide, des-ciclesonide, by approximately 3.6-fold at steady state, while levels of ciclesonide remained unchanged. In another drug interaction study, co-administration of orally inhaled ciclesonide and oral erythromycin, a moderate inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either des-ciclesonide or erythromycin."], "manufacturer_name": ["Covis Pharma US, Inc"], "substance_name": ["CICLESONIDE"], "effective_time": "20221108", "product_ndc": ["70515-701"], "brand_name": ["Omnaris"]}

The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The use of desmopressin nasal spray in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Desmopressin acetate is absorbed through the nasal mucosa. Elimination: Desmopressin acetate exhibits a biphasic elimination profile, with half-lives of 7.8 and 75.5 minutes for the initial and terminal phases, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment: Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate injection (this results in approximately 20 times the exposure of 10 mcg of desmopressin nasal spray). The terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, 4.0 hours in mild renal impairment, 6.6 hours in moderate renal impairment and 8.7 hours in severe renal impairment. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin exposure was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bryant Ranch Prepack"], "substance_name": ["DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE"], "effective_time": "20241003", "product_ndc": ["72162-2129"], "brand_name": ["DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE"]}
