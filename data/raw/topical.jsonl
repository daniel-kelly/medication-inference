( 1 )"], "generic_name": ["BETAMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE"], "id": "facdc991-1981-4ca6-b10e-1f2cb5c3535e", "route": ["TOPICAL"], "description": ["11 DESCRIPTION Betamethasone dipropionate cream USP (augmented), 0.05% contains betamethasone dipropionate USP, a synthetic adrenocorticosteroid, for topical use in a cream base. Betamethasone, an analog of prednisolone, has a high degree of corticosteroid activity and a slight degree of mineralocorticoid activity. Betamethasone dipropionate is the 17,21-dipropionate ester of betamethasone. Chemically, betamethasone dipropionate is 9-fluoro-11\u03b2,17,21-trihydroxy-16\u03b2-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 17,21-dipropionate, with the empirical formula C 28 H 37 FO 7 , a molecular weight of 504.6, and the following structural formula: Betamethasone dipropionate is a white to creamy white, odorless crystalline powder, insoluble in water. Each gram of betamethasone dipropionate cream USP (augmented), 0.05% contains: 0.64 mg betamethasone dipropionate USP (equivalent to 0.5 mg betamethasone) in a white cream base of carbomer homopolymer type C, ceteareth-30, chlorocresol, cyclomethicone, glyceryl oleate, propylene glycol, purified water, sodium hydroxide, sorbitol solution, white petrolatum and white wax. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action of betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) in corticosteroid responsive dermatoses is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstrictor Assay Trials performed with betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented), 0.05% indicate that it is in the high range of potency as demonstrated in vasoconstrictor trials in healthy subjects when compared with other topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No pharmacokinetics trials have been conducted with betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented), 0.05%. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed through normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids enter pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees, are metabolized primarily in the liver, and excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."], "manufacturer_name": ["Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc."], "substance_name": ["BETAMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE"], "effective_time": "20210406", "product_ndc": ["51672-1310"], "brand_name": ["Betamethasone Dipropionate"]}

The molecular weight is 234.34. Composition of Solution : Each mL contains 20 mg (2%) of lidocaine hydrochloride USP and the following inactive ingredients: carboxymethylcellulose sodium, flavoring, methylparaben, propylparaben, purified water and saccharin sodium. chem-structure.jpg"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Lidocaine is absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption being dependent upon concentration and total dose administered, the specific site of application, and duration of exposure. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity."], "manufacturer_name": ["NuCare Pharmaceuticals,Inc."], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240208", "product_ndc": ["68071-3449"], "brand_name": ["Lidocaine Hydrochloride"]}

Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action: Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale. Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not.

The release liner is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 10 cm \u00d7 14 cm. Lidocaine, USP is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol: water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine, USP (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, disodium edetate, gelatin, glycerin, kaolin, methylparaben, polyvinyl alcohol, propylparaben, propylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, partially neutralized sodium polyacrylate, D-sorbitol, tartaric acid, and urea. chemical structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from lidocaine patch 5% Normal volunteers (n = 15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11% to 36% and from 5% to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). figure 1"], "manufacturer_name": ["Quality Care; Products, LLC"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE"], "effective_time": "20250108", "product_ndc": ["55700-932"], "brand_name": ["Lidocaine"]}

Although clindamycin phosphate is inactive in vitro , rapid in vivo hydrolysis converts this compound to the antibacterially active clindamycin. Microbiology Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic. Antimicrobial Activity Clindamycin is active in vitro against most isolates of Propionibacterium acnes; however, the clinical significance is unknown. Resistance Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Like other topical corticosteroids, fluticasone propionate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Fluticasone propionate is lipophilic and has a strong affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. It has weak affinity for the progesterone receptor, and virtually no affinity for the mineralocorticoid, estrogen, or androgen receptors. The therapeutic potency of glucocorticoids is related to the half-life of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex. The half-life of the fluticasone propionate-glucocorticoid receptor complex is approximately 10 hours. Studies performed with fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05% indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids. Pharmacokinetics Absorption - The activity of Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% is due to the parent drug, fluticasone propionate. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressing enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. In a human study of 12 healthy males receiving 12.5 g of 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream twice daily for 3 weeks, plasma levels were generally below the level of quantification (0.05 ng/mL). In another study of 6 healthy males administered 25 g of 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream under occlusion for 5 days, plasma levels of fluticasone ranged from 0.07 to 0.39 ng/mL. In an animal study using radiolabeled 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream and ointment preparations, rats received a topical dose of 1 g/kg for a 24-hour period. Total recovery of radioactivity was approximately 80% at the end of 7 days. The majority of the dose (73%) was recovered from the surface of the application site. Less than 1% of the dose was recovered in the skin at the application site. Approximately 5% of the dose was absorbed systemically through the skin. Absorption from the skin continued for the duration of the study (7 days), indicating a long retention time at the application site. Distribution - Following intravenous administration of 1 mg fluticasone propionate in healthy volunteers, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The apparent volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg (range, 2.3 to 16.7 L/kg). The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Metabolism - No metabolites of fluticasone propionate were detected in an in vitro study of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate incubated in a human skin homogenate. The total blood clearance of systemically absorbed fluticasone propionate averages 1,093 mL/min (range, 618 to 1,702 mL/min) after a 1-mg intravenous dose, with renal clearance accounting for less than 0.02% of the total. Fluticasone propionate is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated hydrolysis of the 5-fluoromethyl carbothioate grouping. This transformation occurs in 1 metabolic step to produce the inactive 17-\u03b2-carboxylic acid metabolite, the only known metabolite detected in man. This metabolite has approximately 2,000 times less affinity than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Excretion - Following intravenous dose of 1 mg in healthy volunteers, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had an average terminal half-life of 7.2 hours (range, 3.2 to 11.2 hours)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bryant Ranch Prepack"], "substance_name": ["FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE"], "effective_time": "20230717", "product_ndc": ["63629-8658"], "brand_name": ["Fluticasone Propionate"]}

Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities. It also acts as a weak kappa (\u0138) opioid receptor agonist. Menthol chemically triggers the cold-\u2010sensitive TRPM-8 receptors in the skin, which are responsible for the well-\u2010documented cooling sensation that occurs when applied to the skin. Menthol\u2019s analgesic properties are not fully understood; however, they are mediated through a selective activation of \u0138-opioid receptors. Menthol also blocks voltage-\u2010sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue. Menthol works by targeting the k-\u2010opioid receptor on the TRPM8 neuron. The TRPM8 neuron is normally activated at temperatures between (8\u00b0-28\u00b0C). Menthol causes the neuron to fire at temperatures above normal activation, which triggers the characteristic cooling sensation. Also because of menthol's specific targeting of the k-\u2010opioid receptor, it is endowed with analgesic properties. Lidocaine is an amide-\u2010type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses.

Onset of anesthesia: Lidocaine Ointment 5% effects local, topical anesthesia. The onset of action is 3-5 minutes. It is ineffective when applied to intact skin. Hemodynamics: Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. Pharmacokinetics and metabolism: Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration, and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 \u03bcg of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-l-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6.0 \u03bc g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18-21 \u03bc g/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.", "Onset of anesthesia: Lidocaine Ointment 5% effects local, topical anesthesia.

In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor added to bupivacaine to slow absorption into the general circulation and thus prolong maintenance of an active tissue concentration. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic absorption of bupivacaine produces effects on the cardiovascular system and CNS. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. These cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Following systemic absorption, bupivacaine can produce CNS stimulation, CNS depression, or both. Apparent central stimulation is manifested as restlessness, tremors, and shivering, progressing to convulsions, followed by CNS depression and coma progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest. However, bupivacaine has a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited state. The duration of local anesthesia after administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is longer than that observed after administration of other commonly used short-acting local anesthetics. There appears to be period of analgesia that persists after the resolution of the block and return of sensation. The onset of action following dental injections is usually 2 to 10 minutes and may last up to 7 hours. The duration of anesthetic effect is prolonged by the addition of epinephrine 1:200,000. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection do not correlate with local efficacy. Absorption The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000) usually reduces the rate of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine, permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and sometimes prolonging the duration of action [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After injection of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next three to six hours. Distribution Bupivacaine appears to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of bupivacaine appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity (95%) has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4). The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, bupivacaine is distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profile of bupivacaine after direct intravenous injection (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is not approved for intravenous use) suggest a three-compartment open model. The first compartment is represented by the rapid intravascular distribution of the drug. The second compartment represents the equilibration of the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as the brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and liver. The third compartment represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly perfused tissues, such as muscle and fat. Elimination The half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours. Metabolism Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine. The elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely upon the availability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized. Excretion The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Elderly patients exhibited higher peak plasma concentrations than younger patients following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection. The total plasma clearance was decreased in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .

Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine hydrochloride is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine hydrochloride is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine hydrochloride crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine hydrochloride. Approximately 90% of lidocaine hydrochloride administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine hydrochloride following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine hydrochloride required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl\u203e) ions.

In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor added to bupivacaine to slow absorption into the general circulation and thus prolong maintenance of an active tissue concentration. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic absorption of bupivacaine produces effects on the cardiovascular system and CNS. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. These cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Following systemic absorption, bupivacaine can produce CNS stimulation, CNS depression, or both. Apparent central stimulation is manifested as restlessness, tremors, and shivering, progressing to convulsions, followed by CNS depression and coma progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest. However, bupivacaine has a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited state. The duration of local anesthesia after administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is longer than that observed after administration of other commonly used short-acting local anesthetics. There appears to be period of analgesia that persists after the resolution of the block and return of sensation. The onset of action following dental injections is usually 2 to 10 minutes and may last up to 7 hours. The duration of anesthetic effect is prolonged by the addition of epinephrine 1:200,000. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection do not correlate with local efficacy. Absorption The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000) usually reduces the rate of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine, permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and sometimes prolonging the duration of action [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After injection of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next three to six hours. Distribution Bupivacaine appears to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of bupivacaine appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity (95%) has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4). The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, bupivacaine is distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profile of bupivacaine after direct intravenous injection (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is not approved for intravenous use) suggest a three-compartment open model. The first compartment is represented by the rapid intravascular distribution of the drug. The second compartment represents the equilibration of the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as the brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and liver. The third compartment represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly perfused tissues, such as muscle and fat. Elimination The half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours. Metabolism Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine. The elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely upon the availability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized. Excretion The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Elderly patients exhibited higher peak plasma concentrations than younger patients following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection. The total plasma clearance was decreased in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .

Lidocaine Hydrochloride Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bupivacaine blocks the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor added to bupivacaine to slow absorption into the general circulation and thus prolong maintenance of an active tissue concentration. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic absorption of bupivacaine produces effects on the cardiovascular system and CNS. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. These cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Following systemic absorption, bupivacaine can produce CNS stimulation, CNS depression, or both. Apparent central stimulation is manifested as restlessness, tremors, and shivering, progressing to convulsions, followed by CNS depression and coma progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest. However, bupivacaine has a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited state. The duration of local anesthesia after administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is longer than that observed after administration of other commonly used short-acting local anesthetics. There appears to be period of analgesia that persists after the resolution of the block and return of sensation. The onset of action following dental injections is usually 2 to 10 minutes and may last up to 7 hours. The duration of anesthetic effect is prolonged by the addition of epinephrine 1:200,000. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection do not correlate with local efficacy. Absorption The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000) usually reduces the rate of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine, permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and sometimes prolonging the duration of action [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After injection of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next three to six hours. Distribution Bupivacaine appears to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of bupivacaine appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity (95%) has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4). The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, bupivacaine is distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profile of bupivacaine after direct intravenous injection (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is not approved for intravenous use) suggest a three-compartment open model. The first compartment is represented by the rapid intravascular distribution of the drug. The second compartment represents the equilibration of the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as the brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and liver. The third compartment represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly perfused tissues, such as muscle and fat. Elimination The half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours. Metabolism Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine. The elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely upon the availability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized. Excretion The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Elderly patients exhibited higher peak plasma concentrations than younger patients following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection. The total plasma clearance was decreased in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic disease. Patients with hepatic disease, especially those with severe hepatic disease, may be more susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local anesthetics [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of renal disease, factors affecting urinary pH, and renal blood flow [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.7) ] .", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt retaining properties, are used in replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are used primarily for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine hydrochloride stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine hydrochloride is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine hydrochloride is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine hydrochloride crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine hydrochloride. Approximately 90% of lidocaine hydrochloride administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine hydrochloride following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine hydrochloride required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity."], "purpose": ["Purpose: Purpose: First aid antiseptic to help prevent skin infection in minor cuts, scrapes and burns.

The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."], "manufacturer_name": ["Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc."], "substance_name": ["FLUOCINOLONE ACETONIDE"], "effective_time": "20170419", "product_ndc": ["51672-1365"], "brand_name": ["Fluocinolone Acetonide"]}

Each gram of tazarotene cream, 0.1% contains 1 mg of tazarotene, in a white cream base. Tazarotene is a member of the acetylenic class of retinoids. Chemically, tazarotene is ethyl 6-[(4,4-dimethylthiochroman- 6-yl)ethynyl]nicotinate. The compound has an empirical formula of C 21 H 21 NO 2 S and molecular weight of 351.46. The structural formula is shown below: Tazarotene cream contains the following inactive ingredients: benzyl alcohol 1%; carbomer copolymer type A; carbomer homopolymer type B; edetate disodium; medium chain triglycerides; mineral oil; purified water; sodium hydroxide; sodium thiosulfate; and sorbitan monooleate. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1 RAR\u03b2, and RAR \u03b3 , but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2, and RAR \u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours, following topical application of tazarotene to normal, acne or psoriatic skin. In a multiple dose trial with a once daily dose for 14 consecutive days in 9 psoriatic subjects (male=5; female=4), measured doses of tazarotene cream, 0.1% were applied by medical staff to involved skin without occlusion (5 to 35% of total body surface area: mean \u00b1 SD: 14 \u00b1 11%). The C max of tazarotenic acid was 2.31 \u00b1 2.78 ng/mL occurring 8 hours after the final dose, and the AUC 0-24h was 31.2 \u00b1 35.2 ng\u2219hr/mL on day 15 in the five subjects who were administered clinical doses of 2 mg cream/cm 2 . During clinical trials with tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% treatment for plaque psoriasis, three out of 139 subjects with their systemic exposure monitored had detectable plasma tazarotene concentrations, with the highest value at 0.09 ng/mL. Tazarotenic acid was detected in 78 out of 139 subjects (LLOQ = 0.05 ng/mL). Three subjects using tazarotene cream 0.1% had plasma tazarotenic acid concentrations greater than 1 ng/mL. The highest value was 2.4 ng/mL. However, because of the variations in the time of blood sampling, the area of psoriasis involvement, and the dose of tazarotene applied, actual maximal plasma levels are unknown. Tazarotene cream 0.1% was applied once daily to either the face (N=8) or to 15% of body surface area (N=10) of female subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris. The mean C max and AUC values of tazarotenic acid peaked at day 15 for both dosing groups during a 29 day treatment period. Mean C max and AUC 0-24h values of tazarotenic acid from subjects in the 15% body surface area dosing group were more than 10 times higher than those from subjects in the face-only dosing group. The single highest C max throughout the trial period was 1.91 ng/mL on day 15 in the exaggerated dosing group. In the face-only group, the mean \u00b1 SD values of C max and AUC 0-24h of tazarotenic acid on day 15 were 0.10 \u00b1 0.06 ng/mL and 1.54 \u00b1 1.01 ng\u2219hr/mL, respectively, whereas in the 15% body surface area dosing group, the mean \u00b1 SD values of C max and AUC 0-24h of tazarotenic acid on day 15 were 1.20 \u00b1 0.41 ng/mL and 17.01 \u00b1 6.15 ng\u2219hr/mL, respectively. The steady state pharmacokinetics of tazarotenic acid had been reached by day 8 in the face-only and by day 15 in the 15% body surface area dosing groups. In a Phase 3 clinical trial, tazarotene cream, 0.1% was applied once daily for 12 weeks to each of 48 subjects (22 females and 26 males) with facial acne vulgaris. The mean \u00b1 SD values of plasma tazarotenic acid at weeks 4 and 8 were 0.078 \u00b1 0.073 ng/mL (N=47) and 0.052 \u00b1 0.037 ng/mL (N=42), respectively. The highest observed individual plasma tazarotenic acid concentration was 0.41 ng/mL at week 4 from a female subject.

There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.

Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.

The primary action of clotrimazole is against dividing and growing organisms. In vitro , clotrimazole exhibits fungistatic and fungicidal activity against isolates of Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, and Candida species including Candida albicans . In general, the in vitro activity of clotrimazole corresponds to that of tolnaftate and griseofulvin against the mycelia of dermatophytes (Trichophyton, Microsporum , and Epidermophyton) , and to that of the polyenes (amphotericin B and nystatin) against budding fungi ( Candida ). Using an in vivo (mouse) and an in vitro (mouse kidney homogenate) testing system, clotrimazole and miconazole were equally effective in preventing the growth of the pseudomycelia and mycelia of Candida albicans . Strains of fungi having a natural resistance to clotrimazole are rare. Only a single isolate of Candida guilliermondi has been reported to have primary resistance to clotrimazole. No single-step or multiple-step resistance to clotrimazole has developed during successive passages of Candida albicans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes . No appreciable change in sensitivity was detected after successive passages of isolates of C. albicans, C. krusei, or C. pseudotropicalis in liquid or solid media containing clotrimazole. Also, resistance could not be developed in chemically induced mutant strains of polyene-resistant isolates of C. albicans . Slight, reversible resistance was noted in three isolates of C. albicans tested by one investigator. There is a single report that records the clinical emergence of a C. albicans strain with considerable resistance to flucytosine and miconazole, and with cross-resistance to clotrimazole; the strain remained sensitive to nystatin and amphotericin B. In studies of the mechanism of action, the minimum fungicidal concentration of clotrimazole caused leakage of intracellular phosphorus compounds into the ambient medium with concomitant breakdown of cellular nucleic acids and accelerated potassium efflux. Both these events began rapidly and extensively after addition of the drug. Clotrimazole appears to be well absorbed in humans following oral administration and is eliminated mainly as inactive metabolites. Following topical and vaginal administration, however, clotrimazole appears to be minimally absorbed. Six hours after the application of radioactive clotrimazole 1% cream and 1% solution onto intact and acutely inflamed skin, the concentration of clotrimazole varied from 100 mcg/cm 3 , in the stratum corneum to 0.5 to 1 mcg/cm 3 in the stratum reticulare, and 0.1 mcg/cm 3 in the subcutis. No measurable amount of radioactivity (\u22640.001 mcg/mL) was found in the serum within 48 hours after application under occlusive dressing of 0.5 mL of the solution or 0.8 g of the cream. Only 0.5% or less of the applied radioactivity was excreted in the urine. Following intravaginal administration of 100 mg 14 C-clotrimazole vaginal tablets to nine adult females, an average peak serum level, corresponding to only 0.03 mcg equivalents/mL of clotrimazole, was reached 1 to 2 days after application. After intravaginal administration of 5 g of 1% 14 C-clotrimazole vaginal cream containing 50 mg active drug, to five subjects (one with candidal colpitis), serum levels corresponding to approximately 0.01 mcg equivalents/mL were reached between 8 and 24 hours after application."], "manufacturer_name": ["Novitium Pharma LLC"], "substance_name": ["CLOTRIMAZOLE"], "effective_time": "20200813", "product_ndc": ["70954-036"], "brand_name": ["Clotrimazole"]}

The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium topical solution, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After administration of diclofenac sodium topical solution (40 mg/knee every 12 h; total daily diclofenac exposure: 80 mg/knee) for 7.5 days, the mean (SD) AUC 0-12 and mean (SD) C max were 77.27 (49.89) ng\u2219h/mL and 12.16 (7.66) ng/mL, respectively, on Day 1; and 204.58 (111.02) ng\u2219h/mL and 25.24 (12.95) ng/mL, respectively, at steady state on Day 8. After administration of diclofenac sodium topical solution 1.5% (19.3 mg/knee every 6 h; total daily diclofenac exposure 77.2 mg/knee), the mean (SD) AUC 0- 12 and mean (SD) C max were 27.46 (23.97) ng\u2219h/mL and 2.30 (2.02) ng/mL, respectively, on Day 1; and 141.49 (92.47) ng\u2219h/mL and 17.04 (11.28) ng/mL, respectively, at steady state on Day 8. The pharmacokinetics and effect of diclofenac sodium topical solution were not evaluated under the conditions of heat application, occlusive dressings overlay, or exercise following product application. Therefore, concurrent use of diclofenac sodium topical solution under these conditions is not recommended. Distribution: Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac. Elimination Metabolism: Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CYP2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Excretion: Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Specific Populations: Pediatric: The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical solution has not been investigated in pediatric patients. Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interaction Studies Aspirin: When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered.

Clinical Trials Data - The results of use of ciclopirox topical solution, 8% in treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail without lunula involvement were obtained from two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in the United States. In these studies, patients with onychomycosis of the great toenails without lunula involvement were treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8% in conjunction with monthly removal of the unattached, infected toenail by the investigator. Ciclopirox topical solution, 8%, was applied for 48 weeks. At baseline, patients had 20\u201365% involvement of the target great toenail plate. Statistical significance was demonstrated in one of two studies for the endpoint \"complete cure\" (clear nail and negative mycology), and in two studies for the endpoint \"almost clear\" (\u226410% nail involvement and negative mycology) at the end of study.

Ethyl acetate and isopropyl alcohol are solvents that vaporize after application. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% is a clear, colorless to slightly yellowish solution. The chemical name for ciclopirox is 6-cyclohexyl-1-hydroxy-4-methyl-2(1H)-pyridone, with the empirical formula C 12 H 17 NO 2 and a molecular weight of 207.27. The CAS Registry Number is [29342-05-0]. The chemical structure is: Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Microbiology Mechanism of Action - The mechanism of action of ciclopirox has been investigated using various in vitro and in vivo infection models. One in vitro study suggested that ciclopirox acts by chelation of polyvalent cations (Fe +3 or Al +3 ) resulting in the inhibition of the metal-dependent enzymes that are responsible for the degradation of peroxides within the fungal cell. The clinical significance of this observation is not known. Activity in vitro and ex vivo - In vitro methodologies employing various broth or solid media with and without additional nutrients have been utilized to determine ciclopirox minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for the dermatophytic molds. (1-2) As a consequence, a broad range of MIC values, 1-20 ug/mL, were obtained for Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes species. Correlation between in vitro MIC results and clinical outcome has yet to be established for ciclopirox. One ex vivo study was conducted evaluating 8% ciclopirox against new and established Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes infections in ovine hoof material. (3) After 10 days of treatment the growth of T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes in the established infection model was very minimally affected. Elimination of the molds from hoof material was not achieved in either the new or established infection models. Susceptibility testing for Trichophyton rubrum species - In vitro susceptibility testing methods for determining ciclopirox MIC values against the dermatophytic molds, including Trichophyton rubrum species, have not been standardized or validated. Ciclopirox MIC values will vary depending on the susceptibility testing method employed, composition and pH of media and the utilization of nutritional supplements. Breakpoints to determine whether clinical isolates of Trichophyton rubrum are susceptible or resistant to ciclopirox have not been established. Resistance - Studies have not been conducted to evaluate drug resistance development in T. rubrum species exposed to 8% ciclopirox topical solution. Studies assessing cross-resistance to ciclopirox and other known antifungal agents have not been performed. Antifungal Drug Interactions - No studies have been conducted to determine whether ciclopirox might reduce the effectiveness of systemic antifungal agents for onychomycosis. Therefore, the concomitant use of 8% ciclopirox topical solution and systemic antifungal agents for onychomycosis is not recommended. Pharmacokinetics - As demonstrated in pharmacokinetic studies in animals and man, ciclopirox olamine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and completely eliminated in all species via feces and urine. Most of the compound is excreted either unchanged or as glucuronide. After oral administration of 10 mg of radiolabeled drug (14C-ciclopirox) to healthy volunteers, approximately 96% of the radioactivity was excreted renally within 12 hours of administration. Ninety-four percent of the renally excreted radioactivity was in the form of glucuronides. Thus, glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway of this compound. Systemic absorption of ciclopirox was determined in five patients with dermatophytic onychomycoses, after application of ciclopirox topical solution, 8%, to all 20 digits and adjacent 5 mm of skin once daily for six months. Random serum concentrations and 24 hour urinary excretion of ciclopirox were determined at two weeks and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months after initiation of treatment and four weeks post-treatment. In this study, ciclopirox serum levels ranged from 12-80 ng/mL. Based on urinary data, mean absorption of ciclopirox from the dosage form was <5% of the applied dose. One month after cessation of treatment, serum and urine levels of ciclopirox were below the limit of detection. In two vehicle-controlled trials, patients applied ciclopirox topical solution, 8%, to all toenails and affected fingernails. Out of a total of 66 randomly selected patients on active treatment, 24 had detectable serum ciclopirox concentrations at some point during the dosing interval (range 10.0-24.6 ng/mL). It should be noted that 11 of these 24 patients took concomitant medication containing ciclopirox as ciclopirox olamine. The penetration of the ciclopirox topical solution, 8% was evaluated in an in vitro investigation. Radiolabeled ciclopirox applied once to onychomycotic toenails that were avulsed demonstrated penetration up to a depth of approximately 0.4 mm. As expected, nail plate concentrations decreased as a function of nail depth. The clinical significance of these findings in nail plates is unknown.

The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies performed with mometasone furoate cream indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids. In a study evaluating the effects of mometasone furoate cream on the HPA axis, 15 grams were applied twice daily for 7 days to six adult subjects with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. The cream was applied without occlusion to at least 30% of the body surface. The results showed that the drug caused a slight lowering of adrenal corticosteroid secretion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Ninety-seven pediatric subjects ages 6 to 23 months with atopic dermatitis were enrolled in an open-label HPA axis safety study. Mometasone furoate cream was applied once daily for approximately 3 weeks over a mean body surface area of 41% (range 15% to 94%). In approximately 16% of subjects who showed normal adrenal function by Cortrosyn test before starting treatment, adrenal suppression was observed at the end of treatment with mometasone furoate cream. The criteria for suppression were: basal cortisol level of \u22645 mcg/dL, 30-minute post-stimulation level of \u226418 mcg/dL, or an increase of <7 mcg/dL. Follow-up testing 2 to 4 weeks after stopping treatment, available for 5 of the subjects, demonstrated suppressed HPA axis function in one subject, using these same criteria [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Studies in humans indicate that approximately 0.4% of the applied dose of mometasone furoate cream enters the circulation after 8 hours of contact on normal skin without occlusion.

Lidocaine,USP, is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol:water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine, USP (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: glycerin, D-sorbitol, propylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, urea, sodium polyacrylate, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, gelatin, polyacrylic acid, kaolin, tartaric acid, dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, methylparaben, propylparaben, and edetate disodium. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of lidocaine patch is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch Application Site Area (cm2) Dose Absorbed (mg) Cmax (mcg/mL) Tmax (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n =15). Figure 1 Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n=15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2, 6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Trifluent Pharma LLC"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE"], "effective_time": "20240930", "product_ndc": ["73352-845"], "brand_name": ["Tridacaine XL"]}

The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released frommembrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics : The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressing with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours has not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.

Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action: Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics: Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Lidocaine is absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption being dependent upon concentration and total dose administered, the specific site of application, and duration of exposure. In general, the rate of absorption of local anestheticagents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears inthe circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6.0 mcg free baseper mL.

In addition, diclofenac sodium topical solution contains the following inactive ingredients: dimethyl sulfoxide USP (DMSO, 45.5% w/w), ethanol, glycerin, propylene glycol and purified water. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After topical administration to healthy human volunteers of single and multiple maximum doses of diclofenac sodium topical solution, 40 drops (approximately 1.2 mL) to each knee (80 drops total dose), the following diclofenac pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained: (see Table 3 ).

Distribution Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac. Elimination Metabolism Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Excretion Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Special Populations Pediatric: The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical solution has not been investigated in pediatric patients. Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interaction Studies Aspirin: When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known.

Chemically, pimecrolimus is (1R,9S,12S,13R,14S,17R,18E,21S,23S,24R,25S,27R)-12-[(1E)-2-{(1R,3R,4S)-4-chloro-3-methoxycyclohexyl}-1-methylvinyl]-17-ethyl-1, 14-dihydroxy-23,25-dimethoxy-13,19,21,27-tetramethyl-11,28-dioxa-4-aza-tricyclo[22.3.1.04,9]octacos-18-ene-2,3,10,16-tetraone. The compound has the empirical formula C 43 H 68 ClNO 11 and the molecular weight of 810.47. The structural formula is: Pimecrolimus is a white to off-white fine crystalline powder. It is soluble in methanol and ethanol and insoluble in water. Each gram of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% contains 10 mg of pimecrolimus in a whitish cream base of benzyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, citric acid anhydrous, mono- and diglycerides, oleyl alcohol, propylene glycol, sodium cetostearyl sulphate, sodium hydroxide, stearyl alcohol, triglycerides and water."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of pimecrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not known. While the following have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not known. It has been demonstrated that pimecrolimus binds with high affinity to macrophilin-12 (FKBP-12) and inhibits the calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. As a consequence, it inhibits T-cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines. In particular, pimecrolimus inhibits at nanomolar concentrations Interleukin-2 and interferon gamma (Th1-type) and Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10 (Th2-type) cytokine synthesis in human T-cells. In addition, pimecrolimus prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells in vitro after stimulation by antigen/IgE. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult subjects (n=52) being treated for atopic dermatitis [13%-62% Body Surface Area (BSA) involvement] for periods up to a year, a maximum pimecrolimus concentration of 1.4 ng/mL was observed among those subjects with detectable blood levels. In the majority of samples in adult (91%; 1244/1362) subjects, blood concentrations of pimecrolimus were below 0.5 ng/mL. Data on blood levels of pimecrolimus measured in pediatric subjects are described in Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Distribution Laboratory in vitro plasma protein binding studies using equilibrium gel filtration have shown that 99.5% of pimecrolimus in plasma is bound to proteins over the pimecrolimus concentration range of 2-100 ng/mL tested. The major fraction of pimecrolimus in plasma appears to be bound to various lipoproteins. As with other topical calcineurin inhibitors, it is not known whether pimecrolimus is absorbed into cutaneous lymphatic vessels or in regional lymph nodes. Metabolism Following the administration of a single oral radiolabeled dose of pimecrolimus, numerous circulating O-demethylation metabolites were seen. Studies with human liver microsomes indicate that pimecrolimus is metabolized in vitro by the CYP3A subfamily of metabolizing enzymes. No evidence of skin mediated drug metabolism was identified in vivo using the minipig or in vitro using stripped human skin. Elimination Based on the results of the aforementioned radiolabeled study, following a single oral dose of pimecrolimus, ~81% of the administered radioactivity was recovered, primarily in the feces (78.4%) as metabolites. Less than 1% of the radioactivity found in the feces was due to unchanged pimecrolimus."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bryant Ranch Prepack"], "substance_name": ["PIMECROLIMUS"], "effective_time": "20240321", "product_ndc": ["72162-1889"], "brand_name": ["Pimecrolimus"]}

The inactive ingredients: dimethyl sulfoxide USP (DMSO, 45.5% w/w), ethanol (31.3% v/v), purified water, propylene glycol, and hydroxypropyl cellulose. structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium topical solution, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After administration of diclofenac sodium topical solution (40 mg/knee every 12 h; total daily diclofenac exposure: 80 mg/knee) for 7.5 days, the mean (SD) AUC 0-12 and mean (SD) C max were 77.27 (49.89) ng\u2219h/mL and 12.16 (7.66) ng/mL, respectively, on Day 1; and 204.58 (111.02) ng\u2219h/mL and 25.24 (12.95) ng/mL, respectively, at steady state on Day 8. After administration of diclofenac sodium topical solution 1.5% (19.3 mg/knee every 6 h; total daily diclofenac exposure 77.2 mg/knee), the mean (SD) AUC 0- 12 and mean (SD) C max were 27.46 (23.97) ng\u2219h/mL and 2.30 (2.02) ng/mL, respectively, on Day 1; and 141.49 (92.47) ng\u2219h/mL and 17.04 (11.28) ng/mL, respectively, at steady state on Day 8. The pharmacokinetics and effect of diclofenac sodium topical solution were not evaluated under the conditions of heat application, occlusive dressings overlay, or exercise following product application. Therefore, concurrent use of diclofenac sodium topical solution under these conditions is not recommended. Distribution: Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac. Elimination Metabolism: Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CYP2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Excretion: Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Specific Populations: Pediatric: The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical solution has not been investigated in pediatric patients. Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interaction Studies Aspirin: When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known.

In pharmacologic doses, corticosteroids are used primarily for their anti-inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive effects. Topical corticosteroids such as clobetasol propionate are effective in the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses primarily because of their anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. However, while the physiologic, pharmacologic, and clinical effects of the corticosteroids are well known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in each disease are uncertain. Clobetasol propionate, a corticosteroid, has been shown to have topical (dermatologic) and systemic pharmacologic and metabolic effects characteristic of this class of drugs. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids, including clobetasol propionate, is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). As with all topical corticosteroids, clobetasol propionate can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids enter pharmacokinetic pathways similarly to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids, including clobetasol propionate and its metabolites, are also excreted into the bile. Following repeated nonocclusive application in the treatment of scalp psoriasis, there is some evidence that clobetasol propionate topical solution has the potential to depress plasma cortisol levels in some patients. However, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis effects produced by systemically absorbed clobetasol propionate have been shown to be transient and reversible upon completion of a 2-week course of treatment."], "manufacturer_name": ["Golden State Medical Supply, Inc."], "substance_name": ["CLOBETASOL PROPIONATE"], "effective_time": "20250410", "product_ndc": ["51407-737"], "brand_name": ["CLOBETASOL PROPIONATE"]}

The compound has the molecular formula C 18 H 13 ON 3 CI 4 \u2022HNO 3 , a molecular weight of 492.15, and the following structural formula: Oxiconazole nitrate is a nearly white crystalline powder, soluble in methanol; sparingly soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and acetone; and very slightly soluble in water. Oxiconazole nitrate cream, 1% contains 10 mg of oxiconazole per gram of cream in a white to off-white cream base of cetyl alcohol, polysorbate 60, propylene glycol, purified water, stearyl alcohol, white petrolatum, and benzoic acid 0.2% as a preservative. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics The penetration of oxiconazole nitrate into different layers of the skin was assessed using an in vitro permeation technique with human skin. Five hours after application of 2.5 mg/cm 2 of oxiconazole nitrate cream onto human skin, the concentration of oxiconazole nitrate was demonstrated to be 16.2 \u03bcmol in the epidermis, 3.64 \u03bcmol in the upper corium, and 1.29 \u03bcmol in the deeper corium. Systemic absorption of oxiconazole nitrate is low. Using radiolabeled drug, less than 0.3% of the applied dose of oxiconazole nitrate was recovered in the urine of volunteer subjects up to 5 days after application of the cream formulation. Neither in vitro nor in vivo studies have been conducted to establish relative activity between the lotion and cream formulations. Microbiology Oxiconazole nitrate is an imidazole derivative whose antifungal activity is derived primarily from the inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, which is critical for cellular membrane integrity. It has in vitro activity against a wide range of pathogenic fungi. Oxiconazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections at indicated body sites (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ): Epidermophyton floccosum Trichophyton mentagrophytes Trichophyton rubrum Malassezia furfur The following in vitro data are available; however, their clinical significance is unknown. Oxiconazole exhibits satisfactory in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against most strains of the following organisms; however, the safety and efficacy of oxiconazole in treating clinical infections due to these organisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials: Candida albicans Microsporum audouini Microsporum canis Microsporum gypseum Trichophyton tonsurans Trichophyton violaceum"], "manufacturer_name": ["Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc."], "substance_name": ["OXICONAZOLE NITRATE"], "effective_time": "20241219", "product_ndc": ["51672-1359"], "brand_name": ["Oxiconazole Nitrate"]}

Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.

The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium topical solution, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After administration of diclofenac sodium topical solution (40 mg/knee every 12 h; total daily diclofenac exposure: 80 mg/knee) for 7.5 days, the mean (SD) AUC 0-12 and mean (SD) C max were 77.27 (49.89) ng\u2219h/mL and 12.16 (7.66) ng/mL, respectively, on Day 1; and 204.58 (111.02) ng\u2219h/mL and 25.24 (12.95) ng/mL, respectively, at steady state on Day 8. After administration of diclofenac sodium topical solution 1.5% (19.3 mg/knee every 6 h; total daily diclofenac exposure 77.2 mg/knee), the mean (SD) AUC 0- 12 and mean (SD) C max were 27.46 (23.97) ng\u2219h/mL and 2.30 (2.02) ng/mL, respectively, on Day 1; and 141.49 (92.47) ng\u2219h/mL and 17.04 (11.28) ng/mL, respectively, at steady state on Day 8. The pharmacokinetics and effect of diclofenac sodium topical solution were not evaluated under the conditions of heat application, occlusive dressings overlay, or exercise following product application. Therefore, concurrent use of diclofenac sodium topical solution under these conditions is not recommended. Distribution: Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac. Elimination Metabolism: Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CYP2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Excretion: Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Specific Populations: Pediatric: The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical solution has not been investigated in pediatric patients. Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interaction Studies Aspirin: When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered.

( 1.2 ) 1.1 Indication Clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05%, is a super-high potent topical corticosteroid formulation indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe forms of scalp psoriasis in subjects 18 years of age and older. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. The total dosage should not exceed 50 g (50 mL or 1.75 fl. oz.) per week. Patients should be instructed to use clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05%, for the minimum time period necessary to achieve the desired results [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Use in patients younger than 18 years of age is not recommended due to numerically high rates of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 1.2 Limitations of Use Clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05%, should not be used on the face, groin or axillae.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Like other topical corticosteroids, clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05%, has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstrictor Assay Clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05%, is in the super-high range of potency as demonstrated in vasoconstrictor studies in healthy subjects when compared with other topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression In studies evaluating the potential for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, use of clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05%, resulted in demonstrable HPA axis suppression in 5 out of 12 (42%) adolescent subjects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier and occlusion. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. There are no human data regarding the distribution of corticosteroids to body organs following topical application. Nevertheless, once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through metabolic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. They are metabolized, primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. In addition, some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile."], "manufacturer_name": ["Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc."], "substance_name": ["CLOBETASOL PROPIONATE"], "effective_time": "20210318", "product_ndc": ["51672-1347"], "brand_name": ["Clobetasol Propionate"]}

Renal excretion is the major route of elimination of the metabolites. In a clinical pharmacology trial of six healthy adult male volunteers who received a single topical application of 5% 14 C-tavaborole solution, tavaborole conjugates and metabolites were shown to be excreted primarily in the urine. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of tavaborole was investigated in 24 adult subjects with distal subungual onychomycosis involving at least 4 toenails (including at least 1 great toenail) following a single dose and a 2-week daily topical application of 200 \u03bcL of a 5% solution of tavaborole to all ten toenails and 2 mm of skin surrounding each toenail. Steady state was achieved after 14 days of dosing. After a single dose, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) peak concentration (C\u2098\u2090\u2093) of tavaborole was 3.5 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL (n=21 with measurable concentrations, range 0.618-10.2 ng/mL, LLOQ=0.5 ng/mL), and the mean AUC last \u00b1 SD was 44.4 \u00b1 25.5 ng*hr/mL (n=21).

In another study PK of tavaborole was investigated in 22 subjects aged 12 years to less than 17 years with distal subungual onychomycosis involving at least 4 toenails (including at least 1 great toenail with at least 20% involvement) following once daily application of 5% solution of tavaborole to all ten toenails and 2 mm of skin surrounding each toenail for 29 days. On Day 29, the mean \u00b1 SD C max was 5.9 \u00b1 4.9 ng/mL (n=21 with measurable concentrations, range 1.0 -16.4 ng/mL, LLOQ=0.5 ng/mL), and the mean \u00b1 SD AUC 0-24 was 76.0 \u00b1 62.5 ng*hr/mL. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies In vitro studies have shown that tavaborole, at therapeutic concentrations, neither inhibits nor induces cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of tavaborole is inhibition of fungal protein synthesis. Tavaborole inhibits protein synthesis by inhibition of an aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase (AARS). Activity in vitro and in clinical infections Tavaborole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1) ]: Trichophyton rubrum Trichophyton mentagrophytes Mechanism of Resistance Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum strains from isolates collected in the clinical trials have not demonstrated resistance following repeated exposure to tavaborole."], "manufacturer_name": ["Encube Ethicals Private Limited"], "substance_name": ["TAVABOROLE"], "effective_time": "20241210", "product_ndc": ["21922-020"], "brand_name": ["Tavaborole"]}

{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lidocaine patch 5% is indicated for relief of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia.

The release liner is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 10 cm x 14 cm. Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol:water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: purified water, glycerin, sorbitol, polyacrylic acid, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium polyacrylate, propylene glycol, urea, kaolin, tartaric acid, gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, edetate disodium, methylparaben, and propylparaben. molecule"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of a lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). graphs"], "manufacturer_name": ["ST.

Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mupirocin is an RNA synthetase inhibitor antibacterial [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of mupirocin through intact human skin is minimal. The systemic absorption of mupirocin was studied following application of mupirocin cream 3 times daily for 5 days to various skin lesions greater than 10 cm in length or 100 cm 2 in area in 16 adults (aged 29 to 60 years) and 10 children (aged 3 to 12 years). Some systemic absorption was observed as evidenced by the detection of the metabolite, monic acid, in urine. Data from this trial indicated more frequent occurrence of percutaneous absorption in children (90% of subjects) compared with adults (44% of subjects); however, the observed urinary concentrations in children (0.07 to 1.3 mcg per mL [1 pediatric subject had no detectable level]) are within the observed range (0.08 to 10.03 mcg per mL [9 adults had no detectable level]) in the adult population. In general, the degree of percutaneous absorption following multiple dosing appears to be minimal in adults and children. The effect of the concurrent application of mupirocin cream with other topical products has not been studied [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Elimination In a trial conducted in 7 healthy adult male subjects, the elimination half-life after intravenous administration of mupirocin was 20 to 40 minutes for mupirocin and 30 to 80 minutes for monic acid. Metabolism : Following intravenous or oral administration, mupirocin is rapidly metabolized. The principal metabolite, monic acid, demonstrates no antibacterial activity. Excretion : Monic acid is predominantly eliminated by renal excretion. 12.4 Microbiology Mupirocin is an RNA synthetase inhibitor antibacterial produced by fermentation using the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens . Mechanism of Action Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase. Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical administration. Mupirocin is highly protein bound (greater than 97%) and the effect of wound secretions on the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of mupirocin has not been determined. Resistance When mupirocin resistance occurs, it results from the production of a modified isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, or the acquisition of, by genetic transfer, a plasmid mediating a new isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. High-level plasmid-mediated resistance (MIC \u2265512 mcg/mL) has been reported in increasing numbers of isolates of S. aureus and with higher frequency in coagulase-negative staphylococci. Mupirocin resistance occurs with greater frequency in methicillin-resistant than methicillin-susceptible staphylococci. Cross Resistance Due to its mode of action, mupirocin does not demonstrate cross resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial Activity Mupirocin has been shown to be active against susceptible isolates of S. aureus and S. pyogenes , both in vitro and in clinical trials [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )]. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Mupirocin is active against most isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis . Susceptibility Test Methods High-level mupirocin resistance (\u2265512 mcg/mL) may be determined using standard disk diffusion or broth microdilution tests. 1,2 Because of the occurrence of mupirocin resistance in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), it is appropriate to test MRSA populations for mupirocin susceptibility prior to the use of mupirocin using a standardized method. 3,4,5"], "manufacturer_name": ["Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited"], "substance_name": ["MUPIROCIN CALCIUM"], "effective_time": "20250318", "product_ndc": ["46708-624"], "brand_name": ["MUPIROCIN"]}

There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics - The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systematically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."], "manufacturer_name": ["Preferred Pharmaceuticals, Inc."], "substance_name": ["HYDROCORTISONE"], "effective_time": "20240520", "product_ndc": ["68788-9922"], "brand_name": ["Hydrocortisone"]}

Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 33 years of age) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once-daily applications during a 4-week period with, on average, 2.3 grams/day (range 1.6 to 3.1 grams/day) of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel applied as a thin layer to the face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back. After a 4-week treatment, 16 subjects (62%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, with a mean C max of 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL and a mean AUC 0-24hr of 2.49 \u00b1 1.21 ng.h/mL. The most exposed subject had adapalene C max and AUC 0-24hr of 0.35 ng/mL and 6.41 ng.h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine.

The molecular weight is 288.81. COMPOSITION OF SOLUTION: Each mL contains 20 mg of lidocaine HCl, alcohol (less than 0.1%), artificial cherry flavor, glycerin, methylparaben, propylene glycol, propylparaben, saccharin sodium, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose in purified water. The pH is adjusted to 5.5 to 6.5 with 10% citric acid solution or 10% sodium citrate solution. Lidocaine-01"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action: Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics: Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Lidocaine is absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption being dependent upon concentration and total dose administered, the specific site of application, and duration of exposure. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6.0 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity."], "manufacturer_name": ["REMEDYREPACK INC."], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240115", "product_ndc": ["70518-3507"], "brand_name": ["LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE"]}

{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fluorouracil Cream is recommended for the topical treatment of multiple actinic or solar keratoses. In the 5% strength, it is also useful in the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinomas when conventional methods are impractical, such as with multiple lesions or difficult treatment sites. Safety and efficacy in other indications have not been established. The diagnosis should be established prior to treatment, since this method has not been proven effective in other types of basal cell carcinomas. With isolated, easily accessible basal cell carcinomas, surgery is preferred since success with such lesions is almost 100%. The success rate with Fluorouracil Cream is approximately 93%, based on 113 lesions in 54 patients. Eighty-eight lesions treated with the cream produced 7 failures."], "generic_name": ["FLUOROURACIL"], "id": "d05a8a27-b7f9-40cc-a36a-97209fc998b1", "route": ["TOPICAL"], "description": ["DESCRIPTION Fluorouracil Cream, USP 5% is a topical preparation containing the fluorinated pyrimidine 5-fluorouracil, an antineoplastic antimetabolite. Fluorouracil Cream contains 5% fluorouracil in a vanishing cream base consisting of white petrolatum, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, propylene glycol, polysorbate 60, parabens (methyl and propyl), and purified water. Chemically, fluorouracil is 5-fluoro-2,4(1 H ,3 H )-pyrimidinedione. It is a white to practically white crystalline powder which is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol. One gram of fluorouracil is soluble in 100 mL of propylene glycol. The molecular weight of 5-fluorouracil is 130.08 and the structural formula is: Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY There is evidence that the metabolism of fluorouracil in the anabolic pathway blocks the methylation reaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. In this manner, fluorouracil interferes with the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and to a lesser extent inhibits the formation of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Since DNA and RNA are essential for cell division and growth, the effect of fluorouracil may be to create a thymine deficiency which provokes unbalanced growth and death of the cell. The effects of DNA and RNA deprivation are most marked on those cells which grow more rapidly and take up fluorouracil at a more rapid rate. The catabolic metabolism of fluorouracil results in degradation products (e.g., CO 2 , urea, \u03b1-fluoro-\u03b2-alanine) which are inactive. Systemic absorption studies of topically applied fluorouracil have been performed on patients with actinic keratoses using tracer amounts of 14 C-labeled fluorouracil added to a 5% preparation. All patients had been receiving nonlabeled fluorouracil until the peak of the inflammatory reaction occurred (2 to 3 weeks), ensuring that the time of maximum absorption was used for measurement. One gram of labeled preparation was applied to the entire face and neck and left in place for 12 hours. Urine samples were collected. At the end of 3 days, the total recovery ranged between 0.48% and 0.94% with an average of 0.76%, indicating that approximately 5.98% of the topical dose was absorbed systemically. If applied twice daily, this would indicate systemic absorption of topical fluorouracil to be in the range of 5 to 6 mg per daily dose of 100 mg.

The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours have not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.

Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

Onset of anesthesia Lidocaine Ointment USP, 5% effects local, topical anesthesia. The onset of action is 3-5 minutes. It is ineffective when applied to intact skin. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. Pharmacokinetics and metabolism Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration, and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 \u03bcg of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 \u03bcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18-21 \u03bcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity."], "manufacturer_name": ["Proficient Rx LP"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE"], "effective_time": "20191101", "product_ndc": ["63187-975"], "brand_name": ["Lidocaine"]}

Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine hydrochloride is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine hydrochloride is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine hydrochloride crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine hydrochloride. Approximately 90% of lidocaine hydrochloride administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine hydrochloride following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine hydrochloride required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Synthetic analogs such as triamcinolone are primarily used for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension has an extended duration of effect which may be sustained over a period of several weeks. Studies indicate that following a single intramuscular dose of 60 mg to 100 mg of triamcinolone acetonide, adrenal suppression occurs within 24 to 48 hours and then gradually returns to normal, usually in 30 to 40 days. This finding correlates closely with the extended duration of therapeutic action achieved with the drug."], "purpose": ["Purpose: Purpose: First aid antiseptic to help prevent skin infection in minor cuts, scrapes and burns.

Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mupirocin is an RNA synthetase inhibitor antibacterial [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Application of 14 C-labeled mupirocin ointment to the lower arm of normal male subjects followed by occlusion for 24 hours showed no measurable systemic absorption (less than 1.1 nanogram mupirocin per milliliter of whole blood). Measurable radioactivity was present in the stratum corneum of these subjects 72 hours after application. The effect of the concurrent application of mupirocin ointment with other topical products has not been studied [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Elimination In a trial conducted in 7 healthy adult male subjects, the elimination half-life after intravenous administration of mupirocin was 20 to 40 minutes for mupirocin and 30 to 80 minutes for monic acid. Metabolism: Following intravenous or oral administration, mupirocin is rapidly metabolized. The principal metabolite, monic acid, demonstrates no antibacterial activity. Excretion: Monic acid is predominantly eliminated by renal excretion. 12.4 Microbiology Mupirocin is an RNA synthetase inhibitor antibacterial produced by fermentation using the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens . Mechanism of Action Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase. Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical administration. Mupirocin is highly protein bound (greater than 97%) and the effect of wound secretions on the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of mupirocin has not been determined. Resistance When mupirocin resistance occurs, it results from the production of a modified isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, or the acquisition of, by genetic transfer, a plasmid mediating a new isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. High-level plasmid-mediated resistance (MIC \u2265512 mcg/mL) has been reported in increasing numbers of isolates of S. aureus and with higher frequency in coagulase-negative staphylococci. Mupirocin resistance occurs with greater frequency in methicillin-resistant than methicillin-susceptible staphylococci. Cross Resistance Due to its mode of action, mupirocin does not demonstrate cross resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial Activity Mupirocin has been shown to be active against susceptible isolates of S. aureus and S. pyogenes , both in vitro and in clinical trials [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )]. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Mupirocin is active against most isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis . Susceptibility Test Methods High-level mupirocin resistance (\u2265512 mcg/mL) may be determined using standard disk diffusion or broth microdilution tests. 1,2 Because of the occurrence of mupirocin resistance in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), it is appropriate to test MRSA populations for mupirocin susceptibility prior to the use of mupirocin using a standardized method. 3,4,5"], "manufacturer_name": ["Preferred Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "substance_name": ["MUPIROCIN"], "effective_time": "20250115", "product_ndc": ["68788-8534"], "brand_name": ["Mupirocin"]}

Since it penetrates the skin, it creates an anesthetic effect by not just preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain out by stopping them before they begin. Menthol has some local anesthetic and counter irritant qualities and acts as a weak kappa opioid receptor agonist making it an analgesic as well, its ability to chemically trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors in the skin is responsible for its cooling sensation when applied to the skin. Lastly, it enhances the efficacy of other topical applications by increasing penetration via vasodilation. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Lidocaine- Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/ toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics, but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey, arterial blood levels of 18-21 g/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity. Excretion: Lidocaine- Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15).

There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.

The release liner is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 10 cm x 14 cm. Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol:water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: purified water, glycerin, sorbitol, polyacrylic acid, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium polyacrylate, propylene glycol, urea, kaolin, tartaric acid, gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, edetate disodium, methylparaben, and propylparaben. molecule"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of a lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When LIDOCAN\u2122 III is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). graphs"], "manufacturer_name": ["PURETEK CORPORATION"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE"], "effective_time": "20240703", "product_ndc": ["59088-907"], "brand_name": ["Lidocan III"]}

There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.

Diclofenac sodium topical solution contains 1.5% w/w diclofenac sodium, a benzeneacetic acid derivative that is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), designated chemically as 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino]-benzeneacetic acid, monosodium salt. The molecular weight is 318.14. Its molecular formula is C 14 H 10 Cl 2 NNaO 2 and it has the following structural formula: Each 1 mL of solution contains 16.05 mg of diclofenac sodium. In addition, diclofenac sodium topical solution contains the following inactive ingredients: dimethyl sulfoxide USP (DMSO, 45.5% w/w), ethanol, glycerin, propylene glycol and purified water. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After topical administration to healthy human volunteers of single and multiple maximum doses of diclofenac sodium topical solution, 40 drops (approximately 1.2 mL) to each knee (80 drops total dose), the following diclofenac pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained: (see Table 3 ). Table 3: Single-Dose (80 drops) and Multiple Dose (80 drops four times daily for 7 days) Diclofenac Sodium Topical Solution Pharmacokinetic Parameters Diclofenac Sodium Pharmacokinetic Parameters Normal Adults [N=18] (Age: 18 to 55 years) Normal Adults [N=19] (Age: 18 to 55 years) Single Dose Multiple Dose Four times daily for 7 days AUC 0-t 177.5 \u00b1 72.6 ng\u2219h/mL 695.4 \u00b1 348.9 ng\u2219h/mL AUC 0-inf 196.3 \u00b1 68.5 ng\u2219h/mL 745.2 \u00b1 374.7 ng\u2219h/mL Plasma C max 8.1 \u00b1 5.9 ng/mL 19.4 \u00b1 9.3 ng/mL Plasma T max (h) 11.0 \u00b1 6.4 4.0 \u00b1 6.5 Plasma t 1/2 (h) 36.7 \u00b1 20.8 79.0 \u00b1 38.1 Kel (h -1 ) 0.024 \u00b1 0.010 0.011 \u00b1 0.004 CL/F (L/h) 244.7 \u00b1 84.7 Apparent total body clearance \u2013 Absorption Diclofenac systemic exposure from diclofenac sodium topical solution application (4 times daily for 1 week) was approximately 1/3 of the diclofenac systemic exposure from the diclofenac topical gel application (twice daily for 4 weeks). Distribution Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac. Elimination Metabolism Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Excretion Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Special Populations Pediatric: The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical solution has not been investigated in pediatric patients. Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interaction Studies Aspirin: When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known.

Pharmacokinetics - The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.

Betamethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action for the treatment of tinea pedis, tinea cruris and tinea corporis is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstrictor Assay Studies performed with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream indicate that these topical combination antifungal/corticosteroids may have vasoconstrictor potencies in a range that is comparable to high-potency topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Skin penetration and systemic absorption of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate following topical application of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream has not been studied. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)]. Once absorbed through the skin, the pharmacokinetics of topical corticosteroids are similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Clotrimazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits 14-\u03b1-demethylation of lanosterol in fungi by binding to one of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes. This leads to the accumulation of 14-\u03b1-methylsterols and reduced concentrations of ergosterol, a sterol essential for a normal fungal cytoplasmic membrane. The methylsterols may affect the electron transport system, thereby inhibiting growth of fungi. Activity In Vitro and In Vivo Clotrimazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following dermatophytes, both in vitro and in clinical infections, Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton rubrum [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1)]. Drug Resistance Strains of dermatophytes having a natural resistance to clotrimazole have not been reported. Resistance to azoles, including clotrimazole, has been reported in some Candida species.

In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic absorption of bupivacaine produces effects on the cardiovascular system and CNS. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. These cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Following systemic absorption, bupivacaine can produce CNS stimulation, CNS depression, or both. Apparent central stimulation is manifested as restlessness, tremors, and shivering, progressing to convulsions, followed by CNS depression and coma progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest. However, bupivacaine has a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited state. The duration of local anesthesia after administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is longer than that observed after administration of other commonly used short-acting local anesthetics. There appears to be a period of analgesia that persists after the resolution of the block and return of sensation. The onset of action following dental injections is usually 2 to 10 minutes and may last up to 7 hours. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection do not correlate with local efficacy. Absorption The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000) usually reduces the rate of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine, permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and sometimes prolonging the duration of action [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After injection of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next three to six hours. Distribution Bupivacaine appears to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of bupivacaine appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity (95%) has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4). The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, bupivacaine is distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profile of bupivacaine after direct intravenous injection (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is not approved for intravenous use) suggest a three-compartment open model. The first compartment is represented by the rapid intravascular distribution of the drug. The second compartment represents the equilibration of the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as the brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and liver. The third compartment represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly perfused tissues, such as muscle and fat. Elimination The half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours. Metabolism Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine. The elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely upon the availability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized. Excretion The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Elderly patients exhibited higher peak plasma concentrations than younger patients following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection. The total plasma clearance was decreased in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic disease. Patients with hepatic disease, especially those with severe hepatic disease, may be more susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local anesthetics [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of renal disease, factors affecting urinary pH, and renal blood flow [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.7) ] .", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine hydrochloride stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine hydrochloride is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine hydrochloride is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine hydrochloride crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine hydrochloride. Approximately 90% of lidocaine hydrochloride administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine hydrochloride following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine hydrochloride required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Synthetic analogs such as triamcinolone are primarily used for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension has an extended duration of effect which may be sustained over a period of several weeks. Studies indicate that following a single intramuscular dose of 60 mg to 100 mg of triamcinolone acetonide, adrenal suppression occurs within 24 to 48 hours and then gradually returns to normal, usually in 30 to 40 days.

Each gram of Retin-A Micro Gel, 0.04%, contains 0.4 mg of tretinoin. The formulation contains methyl methacrylate/glycol dimethacrylate crosspolymer (MICROSPONGE \u00ae System), propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate and butylated hydroxytoluene to enable inclusion of the active ingredient, tretinoin, in an aqueous gel. Other components consist of benzyl alcohol, butylated hydroxytoluene, carbomer 974P, cyclomethicone and dimethicone copolyol, disodium EDTA, glycerin, PPG-20 methyl glucose ether distearate, propylene glycol, purified water, sorbic acid, and trolamine. Tretinoin Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Although tretinoin activates three members of the retinoic acid (RAR) nuclear receptors (RAR\u03b1, RAR\u00df, and RAR\u03b3) which may act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation, it has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors and/or other mechanisms. The exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown. Current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedone formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tretinoin is a metabolite of Vitamin A metabolism in man. Percutaneous absorption, as determined by the cumulative excretion of radiolabeled drug into urine and feces, was assessed in 44 healthy men and women after single and repeated daily applications of 500 mg of a 0.1% tretinoin gel formulation. Estimates of in vivo bioavailability, mean (SD)%, following both single and multiple daily applications, for a period of 28 days with the 0.1% gel, were 0.82 (0.11)% and 1.41 (0.54)%, respectively. The plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites, 13- cis -retinoic acid, all- trans -4-oxo-retinoic acid, and 13- cis -4-oxo-retinoic acid, generally ranged from 1 to 3 ng/mL and were essentially unaltered after either single or multiple daily applications of Retin-A Micro (tretinoin) Gel microsphere, 0.1%, relative to baseline levels.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics DICLOFENAC EPOLAMINE TOPICAL SYSTEM 1.3% applied to intact skin provides local analgesia by releasing diclofenac epolamine from the topical system into the skin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption- Adults Following a single application of the DICLOFENAC EPOLAMINE TOPICAL SYSTEM 1.3% on the upper inner arm, peak plasma concentrations of diclofenac (range 0.7 \u2013 6 ng/mL) were noted between 10 \u2013 20 hours of application. Plasma concentrations of diclofenac in the range of 1.3 \u2013 8.8 ng/mL were noted after five days with twice-a-day DICLOFENAC EPOLAMINE TOPICAL SYSTEM 1.3% application. Systemic exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentrations of diclofenac, after repeated dosing for four days with DICLOFENAC EPOLAMINE TOPICAL SYSTEM 1.3%, were lower (<1%) than after a single oral 50-mg diclofenac sodium tablet. The pharmacokinetics of DICLOFENAC EPOLAMINE TOPICAL SYSTEM 1.3% has been tested in healthy volunteers at rest or undergoing moderate exercise (cycling 20 min/h for 12 h at a mean HR of 100.3 bpm). No clinically relevant differences in systemic absorption were observed, with peak plasma concentrations in the range of 2.2 \u2013 8.1 ng/mL while resting, and 2.7 \u2013 7.2 ng/mL during exercise. Absorption \u2013 Pediatrics Diclofenac plasma concentration was assessed in pediatric patients 6 years and older at a fixed time point 24-hours after the initial application and at the final visit (Day 3 \u2013 15). The resulting average concentrations were 1.65 ng/mL and 1.80 ng/mL, respectively, both of which are similar to the values observed in adults. Distribution Diclofenac has a very high affinity (>99%) for human serum albumin. Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses, and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac. Elimination Metabolism Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy- diclofenac. Excretion The plasma elimination half-life of diclofenac after application of DICLOFENAC EPOLAMINE TOPICAL SYSTEM 1.3% is approximately 12 hours. Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites. Specific Populations The pharmacokinetics of DICLOFENAC EPOLAMINE TOPICAL SYSTEM 1.3% has not been investigated in children, patients with hepatic or renal impairment, or specific racial groups. Drug Interaction Studies Aspirin: When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known.

Nystatin is a polyene antimycotic obtained from Streptomyces noursei . It is a yellow to light tan powder with a cereal like odor, practically insoluble in water, and practically insoluble in alcohol. Structural formula: C 47 H 75 NO 17 MW = 926.23 Triamcinolone acetonide is designated chemically as 9-fluoro-11\u03b2, 16 \u03b1, 17, 21-tetrahydroxypregna-1, 4-diene-3, 20-dione cyclic 16, 17-acetal with acetone. The white to cream colored crystalline powder has a slight odor, is practically insoluble in water, and sparingly soluble in dehydrated alcohol. Structural formula: C 24 H 31 FO 6 MW = 434.50 Nystatin and Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream USP is a soft, smooth cream having a light yellow to buff color. Each gram provides 100,000 USP Nystatin units and 1 mg Triamcinolone Acetonide USP in an aqueous perfumed vanishing cream base with cetearyl alcohol and ceteareth-20, dried aluminum hydroxide gel, methylparaben, mono- and di-glycerides, noncrystallizing sorbitol solution, polyoxyl (8) stearate, polysorbate 60, propylene glycol, propylparaben, simethicone emulsion, sorbic acid, titanium dioxide and white petrolatum. image image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Nystatin Nystatin exerts its antifungal activity against a variety of pathogenic and nonpathogenic yeasts and fungi by binding to sterols in the cell membrane. The binding process renders the cell membrane incapable of functioning as a selective barrier. Nystatin provides specific anticandidal activity to Candida (Monilia) albicans and other Candida species, but is not active against bacteria, protozoa, trichomonads, or viruses. Nystatin is not absorbed from intact skin or mucous membranes. Triamcinolone Acetonide Triamcinolone acetonide is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions, characteristic of the topical corticosteroid class of drugs. The pharmacologic effects of the topical corticosteroids are well known; however, the mechanisms of their dermatologic actions are unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile. Nystatin and Triamcinolone Acetonide During clinical studies of mild to severe manifestations of cutaneous candidiasis, patients treated with nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide showed a faster and more pronounced clearing of erythema and pruritus than patients treated with nystatin or triamcinolone acetonide alone."], "manufacturer_name": ["Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc."], "substance_name": ["NYSTATIN", "TRIAMCINOLONE ACETONIDE"], "effective_time": "20250313", "product_ndc": ["68180-545"], "brand_name": ["Nystatin and Triamcinolone Acetonide"]}

See INDICATIONS for specific uses. Each mL contains: lidocaine hydrochloride, USP .................................................................................................... 40 mg Methylparaben, Sodium Hydroxide (to adjust pH) in an aqueous solution. NOT FOR INJECTION. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)- N -(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-, monohydrochloride, monohydrate. It has the following structural formula: chem-structure-lidocaine.jpg"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate of absorption and percent of dose absorbed depending upon concentration and total dose administered, the specific site of application, and duration of exposure. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per ml, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma above 6 mcg free base per ml. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18-21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity."], "manufacturer_name": ["Golden State Medical Supply, Inc."], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240109", "product_ndc": ["51407-825"], "brand_name": ["Lidocaine Hydrochloride"]}

While the following have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not known. It has been demonstrated that pimecrolimus binds with high affinity to macrophilin-12 (FKBP-12) and inhibits the calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. As a consequence, it inhibits T-cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines. In particular, pimecrolimus inhibits at nanomolar concentrations Interleukin-2 and interferon gamma (Th1-type) and Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10 (Th2-type) cytokine synthesis in human T-cells. In addition, pimecrolimus prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells in vitro after stimulation by antigen/IgE. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult subjects (n=52) being treated for atopic dermatitis [13%-62% Body Surface Area (BSA) involvement] for periods up to a year, a maximum pimecrolimus concentration of 1.4 ng/mL was observed among those subjects with detectable blood levels. In the majority of samples in adult (91%; 1244/1362) subjects, blood concentrations of pimecrolimus were below 0.5 ng/mL. Data on blood levels of pimecrolimus measured in pediatric subjects are described in Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Distribution Laboratory in vitro plasma protein binding studies using equilibrium gel filtration have shown that 99.5% of pimecrolimus in plasma is bound to proteins over the pimecrolimus concentration range of 2-100 ng/mL tested. The major fraction of pimecrolimus in plasma appears to be bound to various lipoproteins. As with other topical calcineurin inhibitors, it is not known whether pimecrolimus is absorbed into cutaneous lymphatic vessels or in regional lymph nodes. Metabolism Following the administration of a single oral radiolabeled dose of pimecrolimus, numerous circulating O-demethylation metabolites were seen. Studies with human liver microsomes indicate that pimecrolimus is metabolized in vitro by the CYP3A subfamily of metabolizing enzymes. No evidence of skin mediated drug metabolism was identified in vivo using the minipig or in vitro using stripped human skin. Elimination Based on the results of the aforementioned radiolabeled study, following a single oral dose of pimecrolimus, ~81% of the administered radioactivity was recovered, primarily in the feces (78.4%) as metabolites.

This eutectic mixture has a melting point below room temperature and therefore both local anesthetics exist as a liquid oil rather than as crystals. It is packaged in 5 gram and 30 gram tubes. Lidocaine, USP is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4 and has the following structure: Prilocaine, USP is chemically designated as propanamide, N -(2-methylphenyl)-2-(propylamino), has an octanol: water partition ratio of 25 at pH 7.4 and has the following structure: Each gram of lidocaine and prilocaine cream, USP contains lidocaine 25 mg, prilocaine 25 mg, carbomer homopolymer Type B, polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil, purified water to 1 gram and sodium hydroxide to adjust to a pH approximating 9. Lidocaine and prilocaine cream contains no preservative, however it passes the USP antimicrobial effectiveness test due to the pH. The specific gravity of lidocaine and prilocaine cream is 1.00. Image Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine and prilocaine cream, 2.5%/2.5%, applied to intact skin under occlusive dressing, provides dermal analgesia by the release of lidocaine and prilocaine from the cream into the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin and by the accumulation of lidocaine and prilocaine in the vicinity of dermal pain receptors and nerve endings. Lidocaine and prilocaine are amide-type local anesthetic agents. Both lidocaine and prilocaine stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. The onset, depth and duration of dermal analgesia on intact skin provided by lidocaine and prilocaine cream depend primarily on the duration of application. To provide sufficient analgesia for clinical procedures such as intravenous catheter placement and venipuncture, lidocaine and prilocaine cream should be applied under an occlusive dressing for at least 1 hour. To provide dermal analgesia for clinical procedures such as split skin graft harvesting, lidocaine and prilocaine cream should be applied under occlusive dressing for at least 2 hours. Satisfactory dermal analgesia is achieved 1 hour after application, reaches maximum at 2 hours to 3 hours and persists for 1 hour to 2 hours after removal. Absorption from the genital mucosa is more rapid and onset time is shorter (5 minutes to 10 minutes) than after application to intact skin. After a 5 minutes to 10 minute application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream to female genital mucosa, the average duration of effective analgesia to an argon laser stimulus (which produced a sharp, pricking pain) was 15 minutes to 20 minutes (individual variations in the range of 5 minutes to 45 minutes). Dermal application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream may cause a transient, local blanching followed by a transient, local redness or erythema. Pharmacokinetics Lidocaine and prilocaine cream are a eutectic mixture of lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5% formulated as an oil in water emulsion. In this eutectic mixture, both anesthetics are liquid at room temperature (see DESCRIPTION ) and the penetration and subsequent systemic absorption of both prilocaine and lidocaine are enhanced over that which would be seen if each component in crystalline form was applied separately as a 2.5% topical cream. Absorption The amount of lidocaine and prilocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine and prilocaine cream is directly related to both the duration of application and to the area over which it is applied. In two pharmacokinetic studies, 60 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream (1.5 g lidocaine and 1.5 g prilocaine) was applied to 400 cm 2 of intact skin on the lateral thigh and then covered by an occlusive dressing. The subjects were then randomized such that one-half of the subjects had the occlusive dressing and residual cream removed after 3 hours, while the remainder left the dressing in place for 24 hours. The results from these studies are summarized below. TABLE 1 Absorption of Lidocaine and Prilocaine from Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream: Normal Volunteers (N=16) *Maximum recommended duration of exposure is 4 hours. Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream (g) Area (cm 2 ) Time on (hrs) Drug Content (mg) Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 60 400 3 lidocaine 1,500 54 0.12 4 prilocaine 1,500 92 0.07 4 60 400 24 * lidocaine 1,500 243 0.28 10 prilocaine 1,500 503 0.14 10 When 60 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream was applied over 400 cm 2 for 24 hours, peak blood levels of lidocaine are approximately 1/20 the systemic toxic level. Likewise, the maximum prilocaine level is about 1/36 the toxic level. In a pharmacokinetic study, lidocaine and prilocaine cream was applied to penile skin in 20 adult male patients in doses ranging from 0.5 g to 3.3 g for 15 minutes. Plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine following lidocaine and prilocaine cream application in this study were consistently low (2.5 ng/mL to 16 ng/mL for lidocaine and 2.5 ng/mL to 7 ng/mL for prilocaine). The application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream to broken or inflamed skin, or to 2,000 cm 2 or more of skin where more of both anesthetics are absorbed, could result in higher plasma levels that could, in susceptible individuals, produce a systemic pharmacologic response. The absorption of lidocaine and prilocaine cream applied to genital mucous membranes was studied in two open-label clinical trials. Twenty-nine patients received 10 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream applied for 10 minutes to 60 minutes in the vaginal fornices. Plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine following lidocaine and prilocaine cream application in these studies ranged from 148 ng/mL to 641 ng/mL for lidocaine and 40 ng/mL to 346 ng/mL for prilocaine and time to reach maximum concentration (t max ) ranged from 21 minutes to 125 minutes for lidocaine and from 21 minutes to 95 minutes for prilocaine. These levels are well below the concentrations anticipated to give rise to systemic toxicity (approximately 5,000 ng/mL for lidocaine and prilocaine). Distribution When each drug is administered intravenously, the steady-state volume of distribution is 1.1 L/kg to 2.1 L/kg (mean 1.5, \u00b10.3 SD, n=13) for lidocaine and is 0.7 L/kg to 4.4 L/kg (mean 2.6, \u00b11.3 SD, n=13) for prilocaine. The larger distribution volume for prilocaine produces the lower plasma concentrations of prilocaine observed when equal amounts of prilocaine and lidocaine are administered. At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 mcg/mL to 4 mcg/mL of free base) the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Prilocaine is 55% bound to plasma proteins. Both lidocaine and prilocaine cross the placental and blood brain barrier, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine or prilocaine are metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. The metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11% to 36% and from 5% to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Prilocaine is metabolized in both the liver and kidneys by amidases to various metabolites including ortho-toluidine and N-n-propylalanine. It is not metabolized by plasma esterases. The ortho-toluidine metabolite has been shown to be carcinogenic in several animal models (see Carcinogenesis subsection of PRECAUTIONS ). In addition, ortho-toluidine can produce methemoglobinemia following systemic doses of prilocaine approximating 8 mg/kg (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Very young patients, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies and patients taking oxidizing drugs such as antimalarials and sulfonamides are more susceptible to methemoglobinemia (see Methemoglobinemia subsection of PRECAUTIONS ). Elimination The terminal elimination half-life of lidocaine from the plasma following intravenous administration is approximately 65 minutes to 150 minutes (mean 110, \u00b124 SD, n=13). More than 98% of an absorbed dose of lidocaine can be recovered in the urine as metabolites or parent drug. The systemic clearance is 10 mL/min/kg to 20 mL/min/kg (mean 13, \u00b13 SD, n=13). The elimination half-life of prilocaine is approximately 10 minutes to 150 minutes (mean 70, \u00b148 SD, n=13). The systemic clearance is 18 mL/min/kg to 64 mL/min/kg (mean 38, \u00b115 SD, n=13). During intravenous studies, the elimination half-life of lidocaine was statistically significantly longer in elderly patients (2.5 hours) than in younger patients (1.5 hours). No studies are available on the intravenous pharmacokinetics of prilocaine in elderly patients. Pediatrics Some pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available in infants (1 month to < 2 years old) and children (2 years to < 12 years old). One PK study was conducted in 9 full-term neonates (mean age: 7 days and mean gestational age: 38.8 weeks). The study results show that neonates had comparable plasma lidocaine and prilocaine concentrations and blood methemoglobin concentrations as those found in previous pediatric PK studies and clinical trials. There was a tendency towards an increase in methemoglobin formation. However, due to assay limitations and very little amount of blood that could be collected from neonates, large variations in the above reported concentrations were found. Special Populations No specific PK studies were conducted. The half-life may be increased in cardiac or hepatic dysfunction. Prilocaine's half-life also may be increased in hepatic or renal dysfunction since both of these organs are involved in prilocaine metabolism."], "manufacturer_name": ["Viona Pharmaceuticals Inc"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE", "PRILOCAINE"], "effective_time": "20240806", "product_ndc": ["72578-165"], "brand_name": ["Lidocaine and prilocaine"]}

{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATION AND USAGE Lidocaine patch 5% is indicated for relief of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia. It should be applied only to intact skin ."], "generic_name": ["LIDOCAINE"], "id": "0a4c88f4-8ca1-6c7e-e063-6294a90a3c52", "route": ["TOPICAL"], "description": ["DESCRIPTION Lidocaine patch 5% is comprised of an adhesive material containing 5% lidocaine, USP, which is applied to a non-woven polyester backing and covered with a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film release liner. The release liner is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 10 cm \u00d7 14 cm. Lidocaine, USP is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol: water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine, USP (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, disodium edetate, gelatin, glycerin, kaolin, methylparaben, polyvinyl alcohol, propylparaben, propylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, partially neutralized sodium polyacrylate, D-sorbitol, tartaric acid, and urea. chemical structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from lidocaine patch 5% Normal volunteers (n = 15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11% to 36% and from 5% to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). figure 1"], "manufacturer_name": ["AvKARE"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE"], "effective_time": "20231116", "product_ndc": ["42291-477"], "brand_name": ["Lidocaine"]}

Clindamycin phosphate is a water-soluble ester of the semisynthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin. The chemical name for clindamycin phosphate is Methyl 7-chloro-6,7,8-trideoxy-6-(1-methyl-trans-4-propyl-L-2-pyrrolidinecarboxamido)-1-thio-L-threo- \u03b1 -D-galacto-octopyranoside 2 -(dihydrogen phosphate).

Chemical Structure Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanisms of Action Clindamycin: Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibacterial [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . Benzoyl Peroxide: Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects but the precise mechanism of action is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The systemic absorption of clindamycin was investigated in an open-label, multiple-dose trial in 16 adult subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris treated with 1 gram of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel applied to the face once daily for 30 days. Twelve subjects (75%) had at least one quantifiable clindamycin plasma concentration above the lower limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.5 ng/mL) on Day 1 or Day 30. On Day 1, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) peak plasma concentration (C max ) was 0.78 \u00b1 0.22 ng/mL (n=9 with measurable concentrations), and the mean AUC 0-t was 5.29 \u00b1 0.81 h\u2219ng/mL (n=4). On Day 30, the mean C max was 1.22 \u00b1 0.88 ng/mL (n=10), and the mean AUC 0-t was 8.42 \u00b1 6.01 h\u2219ng/mL (n=6). Clindamycin plasma concentrations were below LOQ in all subjects at 24 hours post-dose on the three tested days (Day 1, 15, and 30). Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid. 12.4 Microbiology Clindamycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chains by interfering with peptidyl transfer, thereby suppressing bacterial protein synthesis. Clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide individually have been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes , an organism which has been associated with acne vulgaris; however, the clinical significance of this activity against P. acnes is not known. P. acnes resistance to clindamycin has been documented.

Betamethasone, an analog of prednisolone, has high corticosteroid activity and slight mineral-ocorticoid activity. Betamethasone dipropionate is the 17,21-dipropionate ester of betamethasone. Chemically, betamethasone dipropionate is 9-Fluoro-11 \u03b2, 17,21-trihydroxy-16\u03b2-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 17,21-dipropionate, with the empirical formula C 28 H 37 FO 7 , a molecular weight of 504 . 6, and the following structural formula: Betamethasone dipropionate is a white to creamy white, odorless crystalline powder, insoluble in water. Each gram of betamethasone dipropionate cream 0 . 05% contains: 0 . 64 mg betamethasone dipropionate USP (equivalent to 0 . 5 mg betamethasone) in a hydrophilic cream base consisting of purified water, mineral oil, white petrolatum, polyethylene glycol 1000 monocetyl ether, cetostearyl alcohol, monobasic sodium phosphate, propylene glycol, phosphoric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment and chlorocresol as a preservative. structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The corticosteroids are a class of compounds comprising steroid hormones, secreted by the adrenal cortex and their synthetic analogs. In pharmacologic doses corticosteroids are used primarily for their anti-inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive effects. Topical corticosteroids, such as betamethasone dipropionate, are effective in the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses primarily because of their anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. However, while the physiologic, pharmacologic, and clinical effects of the corticosteroids are well known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in each disease are uncertain. Betamethasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid, has been shown to have topical (dermatologic) and systemic pharmacologic and metabolic effects characteristic of this class of drugs. Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile. Sixty-three pediatric patients ages 1 to 12 years, with atopic dermatitis, were enrolled in an open-label, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis safety study. Betamethasone dipropionate cream was applied twice daily for 2 to 3 weeks over a mean body surface area of 40% (range 35% to 90%). In 10 of 43 (23%) evaluable patients, adrenal suppression was indicated by either a less than or equal to 5 mcg/dL pre-stimulation cortisol, or a cosyntropin post-stimulation cortisol less than or equal to 18 mcg/dL and/or an increase of less than 7 mcg/dL from the baseline cortisol. Studies performed with betamethasone dipropionate cream indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids."], "manufacturer_name": ["A-S Medication Solutions"], "substance_name": ["BETAMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE"], "effective_time": "20230706", "product_ndc": ["50090-2182"], "brand_name": ["Betamethasone Dipropionate"]}

The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics - The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systematically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bryant Ranch Prepack"], "substance_name": ["HYDROCORTISONE"], "effective_time": "20240912", "product_ndc": ["63629-2527"], "brand_name": ["Hydrocortisone"]}

The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys.

The inactive ingredients in diclofenac sodium topical solution, USP include: alcohol, dimethyl sulfoxide USP (DMSO, 45.5% w/w), glycerin, propylene glycol, and purified water. Chemical Structure Diagram"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium topical solution, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After topical administration to healthy human volunteers of single and multiple maximum doses of diclofenac sodium topical solution, 40 drops (approximately 1.2 mL) to each knee (80 drops total dose), the following diclofenac pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained: (see Table 3 ). Table 3: Single-Dose (80 drops) and Multiple Dose (80 drops four times daily for 7 days) Diclofenac Sodium Topical Solution Pharmacokinetic Parameters Pharmacokinetic Parameters Diclofenac sodium Normal Adults [N=18] (Age: 18-55 years) Normal Adults [N=19] (Age: 18-55 years) Single Dose Multiple Dose Four times daily for 7 days AUC 0-t 177.5 \u00b1 72.6 ng.h/mL 695.4 \u00b1 348.9 ng.h/mL AUC 0-inf 196.3 \u00b1 68.5 ng.h/mL 745.2 \u00b1 374.7 ng.h/mL Plasma C max 8.1 \u00b1 5.9 ng/mL 19.4 \u00b1 9.3 ng/mL Plasma T max (h) 11.0 \u00b1 6.4 4.0 \u00b1 6.5 Plasma t 1/2 (h) 36.7 \u00b1 20.8 79.0 \u00b1 38.1 K el (h -1 ) 0.024 \u00b1 0.010 0.011 \u00b1 0.004 CL/F (L/h) 244.7 \u00b1 84.7 1 - 1 Apparent total body clearance Absorption Diclofenac systemic exposure from diclofenac sodium topical solution application (4 times daily for 1 week) was approximately 1/3 of the diclofenac systemic exposure from the diclofenac topical gel application (twice daily for 4 weeks). Distribution Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac. Elimination Metabolism Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Excretion Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Special Populations Pediatric: The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical solution has not been investigated in pediatric patients. Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interaction Studies Aspirin: When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known.

This indicates that azelaic acid gel does not increase plasma azelaic acid concentration beyond the range derived from nutrition and endogenous metabolism.

However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No pharmacokinetics trials have been conducted with DIPROLENE Ointment. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed through normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids enter pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees, are metabolized primarily in the liver, and excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."], "manufacturer_name": ["Organon LLC"], "substance_name": ["BETAMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE"], "effective_time": "20220223", "product_ndc": ["78206-124"], "brand_name": ["DIPROLENE"]}

Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of susceptible species resulting in a change in membrane permeability and the subsequent leakage of intracellular components. On repeated subculturing with increasing levels of nystatin, Candida albicans does not develop resistance to nystatin. Generally, resistance to nystatin does not develop during therapy. However, other species of Candida (C, tropicalis, C. guillier mondi, C. krusei, and C. stellatoides) become quite resistant on treatment with nystatin and simultaneously become cross resistant to amphotericin as well.

In the adult trial, 19 subjects (male and female) with tinea pedis applied Ecoza topical foam, 1% once daily for 29 days. Subjects applied a mean daily amount of 2.4 g of Ecoza topical foam, 1% to soles, toes, interdigital spaces and tops of both feet up to the ankles. Blood samples were obtained on Day 29 at pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after application. Results (mean \u00b1 SD) showed the time to reach peak plasma concentrations (T max ) was 6.8 \u00b1 5.1 h with maximum concentration (C max ) of 417 \u00b1 218 pg/ml. The area under the concentration time curve for the first 12 hours post application on Day 29 (AUC (0-12) ) was 3440 \u00b1 1920 pg-h/ml. In the pediatric trial, 18 subjects (male and female ages 12 - 17) with interdigital tinea pedis and positive fungal cultures were treated with Ecoza topical foam, 1% once daily for 4 weeks. Subjects applied a mean daily amount of 3.2 g of Ecoza topical foam, 1% to soles, toes, interdigital spaces and tops of both feet up to the ankles. Blood samples were obtained on Day 28 at pre-dose and 7 h and 11 h post-dose. The mean \u00b1 SD econazole plasma concentration was 397 \u00b1 289, 534 \u00b1 745 and 575 \u00b1 638 pg/mL at pre-dose and 7 h and 11 h post-dose, respectively. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Econazole nitrate, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the fungistatic activity of econazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to econazole inhibition. Activity in vitro and in clinical infections Econazole nitrate has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ].

The action of clotrimazole is fungistatic at concentrations of drug up to 20 mcg/mL and may be fungicidal in vitro against Candida albicans and other species of the genus Candida at higher concentrations. No single-step or multiple-step resistance to clotrimazole has developed during successive passages of Candida albicans in the laboratory; however, individual organism tolerance has been observed during successive passages in the laboratory. Such in vitro tolerance has resolved once the organism has been removed from the antifungal environment. After oral administration of a 10 mg clotrimazole troche to healthy volunteers, concentrations sufficient to inhibit most species of Candida persist in saliva for up to three hours following the approximately 30 minutes needed for a troche to dissolve. The long term persistence of drug in saliva appears to be related to the slow release of clotrimazole from the oral mucosa to which the drug is apparently bound. Repetitive dosing at three hour intervals maintains salivary levels above the minimum inhibitory concentrations of most strains of Candida ; however, the relationship between in vitro susceptibility of pathogenic fungi to clotrimazole and prophylaxis or cure of infections in humans has not been established. In another study, the mean serum concentrations were 4.98 \u00b1 3.7 and 3.23 \u00b1 1.4 nanograms/mL of clotrimazole at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively, after administration as a troche."], "manufacturer_name": ["Hikma Pharmacuticals USA USA Inc."], "substance_name": ["CLOTRIMAZOLE"], "effective_time": "20210730", "product_ndc": ["0054-4146", "0054-8146"], "brand_name": ["Clotrimazole"]}

The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours have not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.

While the following have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not known. It has been demonstrated that pimecrolimus binds with high affinity to macrophilin-12 (FKBP-12) and inhibits the calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. As a consequence, it inhibits T-cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines. In particular, pimecrolimus inhibits at nanomolar concentrations Interleukin-2 and interferon gamma (Th1-type) and Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10 (Th2-type) cytokine synthesis in human T-cells. In addition, pimecrolimus prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells in vitro after stimulation by antigen/IgE. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult subjects (n=52) being treated for atopic dermatitis [13%-62% Body Surface Area (BSA) involvement] for periods up to a year, a maximum pimecrolimus concentration of 1.4 ng/mL was observed among those subjects with detectable blood levels. In the majority of samples in adult (91%; 1244/1362) subjects, blood concentrations of pimecrolimus were below 0.5 ng/mL. Data on blood levels of pimecrolimus measured in pediatric subjects are described in Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Distribution Laboratory in vitro plasma protein binding studies using equilibrium gel filtration have shown that 99.5% of pimecrolimus in plasma is bound to proteins over the pimecrolimus concentration range of 2-100 ng/mL tested. The major fraction of pimecrolimus in plasma appears to be bound to various lipoproteins. As with other topical calcineurin inhibitors, it is not known whether pimecrolimus is absorbed into cutaneous lymphatic vessels or in regional lymph nodes. Metabolism Following the administration of a single oral radiolabeled dose of pimecrolimus, numerous circulating O-demethylation metabolites were seen. Studies with human liver microsomes indicate that pimecrolimus is metabolized in vitro by the CYP3A subfamily of metabolizing enzymes. No evidence of skin mediated drug metabolism was identified in vivo using the minipig or in vitro using stripped human skin. Elimination Based on the results of the aforementioned radiolabeled study, following a single oral dose of pimecrolimus, ~81% of the administered radioactivity was recovered, primarily in the feces (78.4%) as metabolites. Less than 1% of the radioactivity found in the feces was due to unchanged pimecrolimus."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bryant Ranch Prepack"], "substance_name": ["PIMECROLIMUS"], "effective_time": "20240321", "product_ndc": ["72162-1891"], "brand_name": ["Pimecrolimus"]}

The collagen sponge serves as a flexible and mechanically stable carrier for the active substances to facilitate application of the human fibrinogen and thrombin to the wound surface. The active side of the patch is yellow in color due to the presence of a colorant riboflavin (E101); and the non-active side is off-white in color. Each square inch of the patch contains approximately 35.5 mg of human fibrinogen and 12.9 units of human thrombin. Other inactive ingredients include equine collagen, human albumin, sodium chloride, sodium citrate, and L\u2011arginine hydrochloride. TachoSil is sterilized by gamma irradiation after completion of inner and outer packaging, resulting in a sterile product in a sterile inner package. Viral Clearance The active biological substances of TachoSil (human fibrinogen and human thrombin) are manufactured from pooled human plasma collected in facilities in the United States. Human plasma is tested by a Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). NAT testing for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and parvovirus B19 is also performed. Human plasma is also tested for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (anti-HIV 1/2). The manufacturing procedure for each TachoSil component and final product include processing steps designed to reduce the risk of viral transmission. In particular, the virus clearance steps in the manufacture of human fibrinogen and thrombin include pasteurization, precipitation and adsorption. The virus clearance step in the manufacture of the collagen sponge is the pH treatment. The virus clearance capacity of these procedures in the manufacture of fibrinogen, thrombin and collagen sponge has been validated using viruses with a wide range of physicochemical characteristics.

Upon contact with a bleeding wound surface, the active substances coated onto the equine collagen patch become dissolved and partly diffuse into the wound surface. The subsequent fibrinogen-thrombin reaction initiates the last step in the cascade of biochemical reactions-conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin monomers that further polymerize to form the fibrin clot. Hemostasis is achieved when the formed fibrin clot adheres the collagen patch to the wound surface, thus providing a physical barrier to bleeding (Fig 3B) . TachoSil exhibits flexibility to accommodate for the physiological movements of tissues and organs and can withstand pressures up to 61.4 hPa (46.1 mmHg). Figure 3: Scanning Electron Microscopy Photos of TachoSil A . The side view of the TachoSil patch shows the coating of the human plasma components anchored to the indentations of the collagen carrier. B .

The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear.

It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressing with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours has not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration.

The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium topical solution, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivoeffects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After topical administration to healthy human volunteers of single and multiple maximum doses of diclofenac sodium topical solution, 40 drops (approximately 1.2 mL) to each knee (80 drops total dose), the following diclofenac pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained: (see TABLE 3).

Distribution Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac. Elimination Metabolism Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Excretion Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Special Populations Pediatric:The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical solution has not been investigated in pediatric patients. Race:Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.

It is designed to deliver sustained circulating concentrations of estradiol when applied once daily to the skin. The gel is applied to a small area (200 cm 2 ) of the thigh in a thin layer. Estradiol gel is available in five doses of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 grams for topical application (corresponding to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 mg estradiol, respectively). The active component of the topical gel is estradiol. Estradiol is a white crystalline powder, chemically described as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17\u00df-diol. It has an empirical formula of C 18 H 24 O 2 and molecular weight of 272.39. The structural formula is: The remaining components of the gel (carbomer, alcohol [62%], propylene glycol, purified water, and trolamine) are pharmacologically inactive. estradiol-structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman\u2019s therapeutic response to estradiol nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Estradiol diffuses across intact skin and into the systemic circulation by a passive absorption process, with diffusion across the stratum corneum being the rate-limiting factor. In a 14-day, Phase 1, multiple-dose study, estradiol demonstrated linear and approximately dose-proportional estradiol pharmacokinetics at steady state for both AUC0-24 and C max following once daily dosing to the skin of either the right or left upper thigh (Table 2).

Steady-state serum concentration of estradiol are achieved by day 12 following daily application of estradiol to the skin of the upper thigh. The mean (SD) serum estradiol levels following once daily dosing at day 14 are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Mean (SD) Serum Estradiol Concentrations (Values Uncorrected for Baseline) on Day 14 Following Multiple Daily Doses of estradiol 0.1% The effect of sunscreens and other topical lotions on the systemic exposure of estradiol has not been evaluated. Studies conducted using topical estrogen gel approved products have shown that sunscreens have the potential for changing the systemic exposure of topically applied estrogen gels. Distribution The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin. Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens. Although the clinical significance has not been determined , estradiol from estradiol does not undergo first pass metabolism and provides estradiol to estrone ratios at steady state in the range of 0.42 to 0.65. Excretion Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The apparent terminal half-life for estradiol was about 10 hours following administration of estradiol. Potential for Estradiol Transfer The effect of estradiol transfer was evaluated in healthy postmenopausal women who topically applied 1.0 gram of estradiol (single dose) on one thigh. One and 8 hours after gel application, they engaged in direct thigh-to-arm contact with a partner for 15 minutes. While some elevation of estradiol levels over baseline was seen in the male subjects, the degree of transferability in this study was inconclusive. Effects of Washing The effect of application site washing on skin surface levels and serum concentrations of estradiol was determined in 16 healthy postmenopausal women after application of 1.0 gram of estradiol to a 200 cm 2 area on the thigh. Washing the application site with soap and water 1 hour after application removed all detectable amounts of estradiol from the surface of the skin, and resulted in a 30 to 38 percent decrease in the mean total 24-hour exposure to estradiol. figure-one"], "manufacturer_name": ["NorthStar Rx LLC"], "substance_name": ["ESTRADIOL"], "effective_time": "20240514", "product_ndc": ["72603-241", "72603-243", "72603-244", "72603-245", "72603-242"], "brand_name": ["Estradiol"]}

Onset of action The onset of action is 3 to 5 minutes. It is ineffective when applied to intact skin. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption varies depending upon concentration and total dose administered, the specific site of application, and duration of exposure. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug may appear in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological / toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged twofold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL.

Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Fluticasone propionate is lipophilic and has a strong affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. It has weak affinity for the progesterone receptor, and virtually no affinity for the mineralocorticoid, estrogen, or androgen receptors. The therapeutic potency of glucocorticoids is related to the half-life of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex.

Studies performed with fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05% indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids. Pharmacokinetics Absorption - The activity of Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% is due to the parent drug, fluticasone propionate. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressing enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. In a human study of 12 healthy males receiving 12.5 g of 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream twice daily for 3 weeks, plasma levels were generally below the level of quantification (0.05 ng/mL). In another study of 6 healthy males administered 25 g of 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream under occlusion for 5 days, plasma levels of fluticasone ranged from 0.07 to 0.39 ng/mL. In an animal study using radiolabeled 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream and ointment preparations, rats received a topical dose of 1 g/kg for a 24-hour period. Total recovery of radioactivity was approximately 80% at the end of 7 days. The majority of the dose (73%) was recovered from the surface of the application site. Less than 1% of the dose was recovered in the skin at the application site. Approximately 5% of the dose was absorbed systemically through the skin. Absorption from the skin continued for the duration of the study (7 days), indicating a long retention time at the application site. Distribution - Following intravenous administration of 1 mg fluticasone propionate in healthy volunteers, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The apparent volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg (range, 2.3 to 16.7 L/kg). The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Metabolism - No metabolites of fluticasone propionate were detected in an in vitro study of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate incubated in a human skin homogenate. The total blood clearance of systemically absorbed fluticasone propionate averages 1,093 mL/min (range, 618 to 1,702 mL/min) after a 1-mg intravenous dose, with renal clearance accounting for less than 0.02% of the total.

Hydrocortisone acetate provides relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses. PHARMACOKINETICS Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration, and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation of the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjungation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent of drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18-21 g/mL have been shown to be the threshold for convulsive activity. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.

Chemically, clobetasol propionate USP is 21-Chloro-9-fluoro-11\u03b2, 17-dihydroxy-16\u03b2-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 17-propionate, and it has the following structural formula: Clobetasol propionate USP has the empirical formula of C 25 H 32 ClFO 5 and a molecular weight of 466.97. It is a white to almost white, crystalline powder, practically insoluble in water, slightly soluble in benzene and diethyl ether; sparingly soluble in ethanol; freely soluble in acetone, in dimethylsulfoxide, in chloroform, in methanol and in dioxane.

The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressing with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours has not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.

The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."], "manufacturer_name": ["A-S Medication Solutions"], "substance_name": ["TRIAMCINOLONE ACETONIDE"], "effective_time": "20230731", "product_ndc": ["50090-6566"], "brand_name": ["Triamcinolone Acetonide"]}

Of the 13 subjects studied, 1 of 9 with psoriasis was suppressed after 14 days and all 4 of the subjects with atopic dermatitis had abnormal cortisol levels indicative of adrenal suppression at some time after starting therapy with clobetasol propionate foam (See Table 1 below).

The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation, and/or other disease processes in the skin may also increase percutaneous absorption. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized, primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys.

After periods of hyperexcitation, lice and mites become paralyzed and die. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of Spinosad Topical Suspension has not been studied. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Head Lice Infestations An open-label, single-center trial was conducted over a period of seven days to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of spinosad 1.8% in pediatric subjects with head lice infestation. Fourteen (14) subjects, 4 \u2013 15 years of age, with head lice were enrolled into the trial. All subjects applied a single topical (scalp) treatment of spinosad 1.8% for 10 minutes, after which the test article was washed off, and subjects underwent plasma sampling. Results demonstrated that spinosad was below the limit of quantitation (3 ng/mL) in all samples. Plasma concentration of benzyl alcohol was not determined in these subjects. An open-label, two-center trial was conducted over a period of 23 days to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of spinosad 0.9% and the ingredient benzyl alcohol in pediatric subjects with a head lice infestation. Twenty-six (26) subjects between 6 months to 4 years of age were enrolled into the study per protocol. All subjects applied a single topical (scalp) treatment of spinosad 0.9% for 10 minutes, after which the test article was washed off, and subjects underwent plasma sampling over a 12 hour period. Plasma spinosad concentrations were below the limit of quantitation (3 ng/mL) in all samples. Benzyl alcohol was quantifiable (above 1 \u03bcg/mL) in a total of 8 plasma samples in 6 out of 26 subjects (25%): four out of 12 subjects in the 6 months to <2 years age group and two out of 14 subjects in the 2 to 4 years age group. The highest observed concentration was 2.37 \u03bcg/mL. Benzyl alcohol concentrations at 12 hours post-treatment were below limit of quantification (1 \u03bcg/mL) for all subjects. Scabies Infestations An open-label multi-center trial was conducted to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of spinosad 0.9% and the ingredient benzyl alcohol in pediatric subjects with scabies infestation. The PK bioavailability study was completed in 19 pediatrics subjects 5 to 16 years of age. All subjects applied a single topical body treatment of spinosad 0.9% from the neck down to the soles of the feet and allowed treatment to remain on the body for a minimum of 6 hours after which the test article was washed off. Subjects underwent plasma sampling over a 12-hour period after treatment. Plasma spinosad concentrations were below the limit of quantification (3 ng/mL) in all samples. Benzyl alcohol was quantifiable (above 1 \u03bcg/mL) in a total of 9 plasma samples in 6 out of 19 subjects (32%): in 3 out of 10 subjects in the 5 to 9 year age group and in 3 out of 9 subjects in the 10 to 16 years age group. The highest observed concentration was 3.94 \u03bcg/mL at 0.5 hours post-treatment but was below limit of quantification at 1 hour post-treatment for one subject in the 10 to 16 years age group. There were two subjects with a benzyl alcohol concentration at 3 hours post-treatment with the highest value of 3.53 \u03bcg/mL for one subject in the 5 to 9 years age group.

The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics - The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.

Hydrocortisone acetate providesrelief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses. Pharmacokinetics: Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration, and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation of the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjungation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent of drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18-21 g/mL have been shown to be the threshold for convulsive activity.

Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of susceptible species resulting in a change in membrane permeability and the subsequent leakage of intracellular components. On repeated subculturing with increasing levels of nystatin, Candida albicans does not develop resistance to nystatin. Generally, resistance to nystatin does not develop during therapy. However, other species of Candida (C, tropicalis, C. guilliermondi, C. krusei, and C. stellatoides) become quite resistant on treatment with nystatin and simultaneously become cross resistant to amphotericin as well. This resistance is lost when the antibiotic is removed.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Like other topical corticosteroids, fluticasone propionate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Fluticasone propionate is lipophilic and has a strong affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. It has weak affinity for the progesterone receptor, and virtually no affinity for the mineralocorticoid, estrogen, or androgen receptors. The therapeutic potency of glucocorticoids is related to the half-life of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex. The half-life of the fluticasone propionate-glucocorticoid receptor complex is approximately 10 hours. Studies performed with fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05% indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids. Pharmacokinetics: Absorption The activity of fluticasone propionate cream is due to the parent drug, fluticasone propionate. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressing enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. In a human study of 12 healthy males receiving 12.5 g of 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream twice daily for 3 weeks, plasma levels were generally below the level of quantification (0.05 ng/mL). In another study of six healthy males administered 25 g of 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream under occlusion for 5 days, plasma levels of fluticasone ranged from 0.07 to 0.39 ng/mL. In an animal study using radiolabeled 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream and ointment preparations, rats received a topical dose of 1 g/kg for a 24 hour period. Total recovery of radioactivity was approximately 80% at the end of 7 days. The majority of the dose (73%) was recovered from the surface of the application site. Less than 1% of the dose was recovered in the skin at the application site. Approximately 5% of the dose was absorbed systemically through the skin. Absorption from the skin continued for the duration of the study (7 days), indicating a long retention time at the application site. Distribution Following intravenous administration of 1 mg fluticasone propionate in healthy volunteers, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The apparent volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg (range 2.3-16.7 L/kg). The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Metabolism No metabolites of fluticasone propionate were detected in an in vitro study of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate incubated in a human skin homogenate. The total blood clearance of systemically absorbed fluticasone propionate averages 1,093 mL/min (range 618-1,702 mL/min) after a 1 mg intravenous dose, with renal clearance accounting for less than 0.02% of the total. Fluticasone propionate is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated hydrolysis of the 5-fluoromethyl carbothioate grouping. This transformation occurs in 1 metabolic step to produce the inactive 17-\u03b2-carboxylic acid metabolite, the only known metabolite detected in man. This metabolite has approximately 2,000 times less affinity than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Excretion Following intravenous dose of 1 mg in healthy volunteers, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had an average terminal half-life of 7.2 hours (range 3.2-11.2 hours)."], "manufacturer_name": ["E.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug that is converted to its active form, the cognate carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by rapid deesterification in animals and man. Tazarotenic acid binds to all 3 members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3 but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2 and RAR\u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. The mechanism of tazarotene action in acne vulgaris is not defined. However, the basis of tazarotene's therapeutic effect in acne may be due to its anti-hyperproliferative, normalizing-of-differentiation and anti-inflammatory effects. Tazarotene inhibited corneocyte accumulation in rhino mouse skin and cross- linked envelope formation in cultured human keratinocytes. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of Tazarotene Foam are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones, and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. Systemic exposure following topical application of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% was evaluated in one trial. Patients aged 15 years and older with moderate-to-severe acne applied approximately 3.7 grams of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% (N = 13) to approximately 15% body surface area (face, upper chest, upper back, and shoulders) once daily for 22 days. On Day 22, the mean (\u00b1SD) tazarotenic acid C max was 0.43 (\u00b10.19) ng/mL, the AUC 0 - 24h was 6.98 (\u00b13.56) ng\u2219h/mL, and the half-life was 21.7 (\u00b115.7) hours. The median T max was 6 hours (range: 4.4 to 12 hours). The AUC 0-24h for tazarotenic acid was approximately 50-fold higher compared with the parent compound tazarotene. The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life of tazarotene was 8.1 (\u00b13.7) hours. Accumulation was observed upon repeated once-daily dosing as the tazarotenic acid predose concentrations were measurable in the majority of subjects. Steady state was attained within 22 days of daily application. Once-daily dosing resulted in little to no accumulation of tazarotene as predose concentrations were mostly below the quantitation limit throughout the study."], "manufacturer_name": ["Mayne Pharma Inc."], "substance_name": ["TAZAROTENE"], "effective_time": "20240604", "product_ndc": ["68308-685"], "brand_name": ["tazarotene"]}

The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."], "manufacturer_name": ["Padagis Israel Pharmaceuticals Ltd"], "substance_name": ["BETAMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE"], "effective_time": "20240331", "product_ndc": ["45802-505"], "brand_name": ["BETAMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE"]}

The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.

It is designed to deliver sustained circulating concentrations of estradiol when applied once daily to the skin. The gel is applied to a small area (200 cm 2 ) of the thigh in a thin layer. Estradiol gel is available in five doses of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 grams for topical application (corresponding to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 mg estradiol, respectively). The active component of the topical gel is estradiol. Estradiol is a white crystalline powder, chemically described as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17\u03b2-diol. It has an empirical formula of C 18 H 24 O 2 and molecular weight of 272.39. The structural formula is: The remaining components of the gel (carbomer, ethanol (62.03% v/v), propylene glycol, purified water, and triethanolamine) are pharmacologically inactive."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman\u2019s therapeutic response to estradiol gel nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Estradiol diffuses across intact skin and into the systemic circulation by a passive absorption process, with diffusion across the stratum corneum being the rate-limiting factor. In a 14-day, Phase 1, multiple-dose study, estradiol gel demonstrated linear and approximately dose-proportional estradiol pharmacokinetics at steady state for both AUC 0-24 and C max following once daily dosing to the skin of either the right or left upper thigh (Table 2).

Steady-state serum concentration of estradiol are achieved by day 12 following daily application of estradiol gel to the skin of the upper thigh. The mean (SD) serum estradiol levels following once daily dosing at day 14 are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Mean (SD) Serum Estradiol Concentrations (Values Uncorrected for Baseline) on Day 14 Following Multiple Daily Doses of Estradiol Gel 0.1% The effect of sunscreens and other topical lotions on the systemic exposure of estradiol gel has not been evaluated. Studies conducted using topical estrogen gel approved products have shown that sunscreens have the potential for changing the systemic exposure of topically applied estrogen gels. Distribution The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin. Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens. Although the clinical significance has not been determined , estradiol from estradiol gel does not undergo first pass metabolism and provides estradiol to estrone ratios at steady state in the range of 0.42 to 0.65. Excretion Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The apparent terminal half-life for estradiol was about 10 hours following administration of estradiol gel. Potential for Estradiol Transfer The effect of estradiol transfer was evaluated in healthy postmenopausal women who topically applied 1.0 gram of estradiol gel (single dose) on one thigh. One and 8 hours after gel application, they engaged in direct thigh-to-arm contact with a partner for 15 minutes. While some elevation of estradiol levels over baseline was seen in the male subjects, the degree of transferability in this study was inconclusive. Effects of Washing The effect of application site washing on skin surface levels and serum concentrations of estradiol was determined in 16 healthy postmenopausal women after application of 1.0 gram of estradiol gel to a 200 cm 2 area on the thigh. Washing the application site with soap and water 1 hour after application removed all detectable amounts of estradiol from the surface of the skin and resulted in a 30 to 38 percent decrease in the mean total 24-hour exposure to estradiol."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bryant Ranch Prepack"], "substance_name": ["ESTRADIOL"], "effective_time": "20240430", "product_ndc": ["72162-2293"], "brand_name": ["ESTRADIOL"]}

These effects include the growth and maturation of prostate, seminal vesicles, penis and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement, vocal cord thickening, alterations in body musculature and fat distribution. Testosterone and DHT are necessary for the normal development of secondary sex characteristics. Male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from insufficient secretion of testosterone, has two main etiologies. Primary hypogonadism is caused by defects of the gonads, such as Klinefelter's syndrome or Leydig cell aplasia, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins (FSH, LH). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted using Testosterone Topical Solution. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption \u2014 Testosterone Topical Solution delivers physiologic circulating testosterone that approximate normal concentration range (i.e., 300 to 1050 ng/dL) seen in healthy men following application to the axilla. On the skin, the ethanol and isopropyl alcohol evaporate leaving testosterone and octisalate. The skin acts as a reservoir from which testosterone is released into the systemic circulation over time (see Figure 1). In general, steady-state serum concentrations are achieved by approximately 14 days of daily dosing. Figure 1: Mean (\u00b1SD) Serum Testosterone Concentrations on Day 7 in Patients Following Testosterone Topical Solution Once-Daily Application of 30 mg, 60 mg, or 90 mg of Testosterone When testosterone topical solution treatment is discontinued after achieving steady-state, serum testosterone concentrations returned to their pretreatment concentrations by 7 to 10 days after the last application. Distribution \u2014 Circulating testosterone is primarily bound in the serum to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Approximately 40% of testosterone in plasma is bound to SHBG, 2% remains unbound (free) and the rest is bound to albumin and other proteins. Metabolism \u2014Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways. The major active metabolites of testosterone are estradiol and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT concentration increased in parallel with testosterone concentration during testosterone topical solution treatment. The mean steady-state DHT/T ratio remained within normal limits and ranged from 0.17 to 0.26 across all doses on Days 15, 60, and 120. Excretion \u2014 There is considerable variation in the half-life of testosterone as reported in the literature, ranging from 10 to 100 minutes. About 90% of a dose of testosterone given intramuscularly is excreted in the urine as glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites; about 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver. Potential for testosterone transfer: The potential for testosterone transfer from males dosed with testosterone topical solution to healthy females was evaluated in a clinical study conducted with a 2% testosterone formulation. 10 males were treated with 60 mg (2 pump actuations) of testosterone in each axilla (the maximum testosterone dose of 120 mg). At 2 hours after the application of testosterone topical solution to the males, the females rubbed their outer forearms for 15 minutes on the axilla of the males. The males had covered the application area with a T-shirt. Serum concentrations of testosterone were monitored in the female subjects for 72 hours after the transfer procedure. Study results show a 13% and 17% increase in testosterone exposure (AUC [0-24] ) and maximum testosterone concentration (C max ), respectively, compared to baseline in these females. In a prior clinical study conducted with a 1% testosterone formulation under similar study conditions, direct skin-to-skin transfer showed a 131% and 297% increase in testosterone exposure (AUC [0-72] ) and maximum testosterone concentration (C max ), respectively, compared to when men had covered the application area with a T-shirt. In a clinical study conducted with a 2% testosterone formulation to evaluate the effect of washing on the residual amount of testosterone at the axilla, 10 healthy male subjects received 60 mg (2 pump actuations) of testosterone to each axilla (the maximum testosterone dose of 120 mg). Following 5 minutes of drying time, the left axilla was wiped with alcohol towelettes which were assayed for testosterone content. Subjects were required to shower with soap and water 30 minutes after application. The right axilla was then wiped with alcohol towelettes which were assayed for testosterone content. A mean (SD) of 3.1 (2.8) mg of residual testosterone (i.e., 92.6% reduction compared to when axilla was not washed) was recovered after washing this area with soap and water. [ See Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Use of deodorants and anti-perspirants: In a parallel designed clinical study evaluating the effect of deodorants and antiperspirants in healthy premenopausal females dosed with testosterone topical solution, each subject applied either a combined deodorant/antiperspirant spray (6 subjects) or stick (6 subjects) or a deodorant spray (6 subjects) to a single axilla 2 minutes before the application of 30 mg (1 pump actuation) of testosterone to the same axilla. A control group of 6 subjects only applied 30 mg (1 pump actuation) of testosterone to a single axilla. Blood samples were collected for 72 hours from all subjects following testosterone topical solution administration. Although a decrease of up to 33% of testosterone exposure (AUC [0-72] ) was observed when antiperspirants or deodorants are used 2 minutes prior to testosterone topical solution application, underarm deodorant or antiperspirant spray or stick products may be used 2 minutes prior to Testosterone Topical Solution application as part of normal, consistent, and daily routine. [ See Dosage and Administration (2.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.4) ]. Effect of showering/washing: In a parallel designed clinical study to evaluate the effect of washing on the testosterone systemic exposure, two groups of 6 healthy premenopausal female subjects were each dosed with 30 mg (1 pump actuation) of testosterone to a single axilla. The application sites of each group were washed with soap and water 2 hours or 6 hours after the application of testosterone topical solution. A control group of 6 female subjects applied 30 mg (1 pump actuation) of testosterone to a single axilla and did not wash the application site. Blood samples were collected for 72 hours from all subjects following dosing with testosterone topical solution. A decrease of up to 35% of testosterone exposure (AUC [0-72 ]) was observed when applications sites were washed 2 hours and 6 hours after testosterone topical solution application. Patients should be advised to avoid swimming or washing the application site until 2 hours following application of Testosterone Topical Solution.

The chemical name is 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl) amino]benzene- acetic acid, monosodium salt. The molecular weight is 318.14. Its molecular formula is C 14 H 10 Cl 2 NNaO 2 , and it has the following chemical structure: It contains the active ingredient, diclofenac sodium, in an opaque, white gel base. Diclofenac sodium is a white to slightly yellow crystalline powder. Diclofenac sodium is a benzeneacetic acid derivative. The inactive ingredients in diclofenac sodium topical gel include: Carbomer homopolymer Type C, cocoyl caprylocaprate, isopropyl alcohol, mineral oil, polyoxyl 20 cetostearyl ether, propylene glycol, purified water, strong ammonia solution. structure.jpg"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium topical gel, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical gel were assessed in healthy volunteers following repeated applications during 7 days of diclofenac sodium topical gel to 1 knee (4 x 4 g per day) or to 2 knees and 2 hands (4 x 12 g per day) versus the recommended oral dose of diclofenac sodium for the treatment of osteoarthritis (3 x 50 mg per day). A summary of the pharmacokinetic parameters is presented in Table 2. Table 3. Pharmacokinetic Parameters and Comparison of diclofenac sodium topical gel to Oral Diclofenac Sodium Tablets After Repeated Administration Treatment C max (ng/mL) Mean \u00b1 SD % of Oral (CI) Tmax (hr) Median Range AUC0-24 (ng\u25cfh/mL) Mean \u00b1 SD % of Oral (CI) Diclofenac sodium topical gel, 1% 4 x 4 g per day (=160 mg diclofenac sodium per day) 15 \u00b1 7.3 0.6% (0.5-0.7) 14 (0-24) 233 \u00b1 128 5.8% (5-6.7) Diclofenac sodium topical gel, 1% 4 x 12 g per day (=480 mg diclofenac sodium per day) 53.8 \u00b1 32 2.2% (1.9-2.6) 10 (0-24) 807 \u00b1 478 19.7% (17-22.8) Diclofenac sodium tablets, orally 3 x 50 mg per day (=150 mg diclofenac sodium per day) 2270 \u00b1 778 100% 6.5 (1-14) 3890 \u00b1 1710 100% C max = maximum plasma concentration, t max = time of C max . AUC 0-24 =area under the concentration time curve. SD=standard deviation. CI=confidence interval. Systemic exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) and maximum plasma concentrations of diclofenac are significantly lower with diclofenac sodium topical gel than with comparable oral treatment of diclofenac sodium. Systemic exposure with recommended use of diclofenac sodium topical gel (4 x 4 g per day applied to 1 knee) is on average 17 times lower than with oral treatment. (Basis: treatment with diclofenac sodium topical gel of 1 knee, 4 times a day versus 50 mg, 3 times a day of oral diclofenac tablets.) The amount of diclofenac sodium that is systemically absorbed from diclofenac sodium topical gel is on average 6% of the systemic exposure from an oral form of diclofenac sodium. The average peak plasma concentration with recommended use of diclofenac sodium topical gel (4 x 4 g per day applied to 1 knee) is 158 times lower than with the oral treatment. The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical gel has been tested under conditions of moderate heat (application of a heat patch for 15 minutes prior to gel application) and of moderate exercise (first gel application followed by a 20-minute treadmill exercise). No clinically relevant differences of systemic absorption and of tolerability were found between applications of diclofenac sodium topical gel (4 x 4 g per day on 1 knee) with and under the conditions tested. However, the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical gel were not tested under the condition of heat application following gel application. Therefore, concurrent use of diclofenac sodium topical gel and heat is not recommended.

Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), and has the following structure: INGREDIENTS: Each gram of Lidogel\u2122 2.8% Gel contains Lidocaine HCl USP 28 mg. Inactive Ingredients include: Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Citric Acid, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Methylparaben, PEG-4, Propylene Glycol, Propylparaben, Purified Water. image description"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: MECHANISM OF ACTION: Lidogel\u2122 2.8% Gel releases Lidocaine from a mild acidic vehicle to stabilize the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby affecting local anesthetic action. A mild acidic vehicle lowers pH to increase protection against alkaline irritants and to provide a favorable environment for healing. PHARMACOKINETICS: Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration, and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver and metabolites and unchanged drugs are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to but less potent than, those of Lidocaine. Approximately 90% of Lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of Lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of Lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of Lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which Lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter Lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect Lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of Lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey, arterial blood levels of 18-21 g/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.

Image Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Nystatin Nystatin exerts its antifungal activity against a variety of pathogenic and nonpathogenic yeasts and fungi by binding to sterols in the cell membrane. The binding process renders the cell membrane incapable of functioning as a selective barrier. Nystatin provides specific anticandidal activity to Candida (Monilia) albicans and other Candida species, but is not active against bacteria, protozoa, trichomonads, or viruses. Nystatin is not absorbed from intact skin or mucous membranes. Triamcinolone Acetonide Triamcinolone acetonide is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions, characteristic of the topical corticosteroid class of drugs. The pharmacologic effects of the topical corticosteroids are well known; however, the mechanisms of their dermatologic actions are unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile. Nystatin and Triamcinolone Acetonide During clinical studies of mild to severe manifestations of cutaneous candidiasis, patients treated with nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide showed a faster and more pronounced clearing of erythema and pruritus than patients treated with nystatin or triamcinolone acetonide alone. INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide cream is indicated for the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis; it has been demonstrated that the nystatin-steroid combination provides greater benefit than the nystatin component alone during the first few days of treatment."], "manufacturer_name": ["Alembic Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "substance_name": ["NYSTATIN", "TRIAMCINOLONE ACETONIDE"], "effective_time": "20231212", "product_ndc": ["62332-606"], "brand_name": ["Nystatin and Triamcinolone Acetonide"]}

Acyclovir Cream 5% is a formulation for topical administration. The chemical name of acyclovir is 2-amino-1,9-dihydro-9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy) methyl]-6 H -purin-6-one; it has the following structural formula: Acyclovir is a white, crystalline powder with the molecular formula C 8 H 11 N 5 O 3 and a molecular weight of 225. The maximum solubility in water at 37\u00b0C is 2.5 mg/mL. The pKa\u2019s of acyclovir are 2.27 and 9.25. Each gram of Acyclovir Cream contains 50 mg (equivalent to 5% w/w) of acyclovir and the following inactive ingredients: cetostearyl alcohol, mineral oil, poloxamer 407, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, water and white petrolatum. chemstructure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Acyclovir is an antiviral drug active against \u03b1-herpesviruses [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A clinical pharmacology study was performed with Acyclovir Cream in adult volunteers to evaluate the percutaneous absorption of acyclovir. In this study, which included 6 male volunteers, the cream was applied to an area of 710 cm 2 on the backs of the volunteers 5 times daily at intervals of 2 hours for a total of 4 days. The weight of cream applied and urinary excretion of acyclovir were measured daily. Plasma concentration of acyclovir was assayed 1 hour after the final application. The average daily urinary excretion of acyclovir was approximately 0.04% of the daily applied dose. Plasma acyclovir concentrations were below the limit of detection (0.01 \u03bcM) in 5 subjects and barely detectable (0.014 \u03bcM) in 1 subject. Systemic absorption of acyclovir from Acyclovir Cream is minimal in adults. The systemic absorption of acyclovir following topical application of cream has not been evaluated in patients <18 years of age. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action: Acyclovir is a synthetic purine deoxynucleoside analogue with cell culture and in vivo inhibitory activity against HSV types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) DNA polymerases. It inhibits HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication in cell culture and in vivo. The inhibitory activity of acyclovir is selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV. This viral enzyme converts acyclovir into acyclovir monophosphate, a deoxynucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In biochemical assays, acyclovir triphosphate inhibits replication of \u03b1-herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, 2) incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain, and 3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the susceptibility of herpes viruses to antivirals in cell culture and the clinical response to therapy has not been established in humans, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity testing results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit by 50% the growth of virus in cell culture (EC 50 value), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors. Using plaque-reduction assays on Vero cells, the EC 50 values of acyclovir against herpes simplex virus isolates range from 0.09 to 59.9 \u03bcM (0.02 to 13.5 \u03bcg/mL) for HSV-1 and from 0.04 to 44.0 \u03bcM (0.01 to 9.9 \u03bcg/mL) for HSV-2. Resistance In Cell Culture Acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains were isolated in cell culture. Acyclovir-resistant HSV resulted from mutations in the viral thymidine kinase (TK; pUL23) and DNA polymerase (POL; pUL30) genes. Frameshifts were commonly isolated and result in premature truncation of the HSV TK product with consequent decreased susceptibility to acyclovir. Mutations in the viral TK gene may lead to complete loss of TK activity (TK negative), reduced levels of TK activity (TK partial), or alteration in the ability of viral TK to phosphorylate the drug without an equivalent loss in the ability to phosphorylate thymidine (TK altered). In cell culture the following resistance-associated substitutions in TK of HSV-1 and HSV-2 were observed (Table 1).

HSV isolates with frameshift mutations and resistance-associated substitutions in TK and POL were identified. The listing of substitutions in HSV TK and POL leading to decreased susceptibility to acyclovir is not all inclusive and additional changes will likely be identified in HSV variants isolated from patients who fail acyclovir-containing regimens. The possibility of viral resistance to acyclovir should be considered in patients who fail to respond or experience recurrent viral shedding during therapy.

Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic produced from a strain of Saccaropolyspora erythraea (formerly Streptomyces erythreus ). It is a base and readily forms salts with acids. Chemically, erythromycin is C 37 H 67 NO 13 . It has the following structural formula: Erythromycin has a molecular weight of 733.94. It is a white or slightly yellow, odorless or practically odorless, bitter crystalline powder. Erythromycin is very soluble in very polar organic solvents such as alcohols, acetone, chloroform, acetonitrile and ethyl acetate. It is moderately soluble in less polar solvents such as ether, dichloroethylene and amyl acetate. It is slightly soluble in nonpolar solvents such as hexane. It is very poorly soluble in water.

The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteriods are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys.

The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection.

The primary action of clotrimazole is against dividing and growing organisms. In vitro, clotrimazole exhibits fungistatic and fungicidal activity against isolates of Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes , Epidermophyton floccosum,Microsporum canis and Candida species including Candida albicans . In general, the in vitro activity of clotrimazole corresponds to that of tolnaftate and griseofulvin against the mycelia of dermatophytes ( Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton ), and to that of the polyenes (amphotericin B and nystatin) against budding fungi ( Candida ). Using an in vivo (mouse) and an in vitro (mouse kidney homogenate) testing system, clotrimazole and micronazole were equally effective in preventing the growth of the pseudomycelia and mycelia of Candida albicans . Strains of fungi having a natural resistance to clotrimazole are rare. Only a single isolate of Candida guilliermondi has been reported to have primary resistance to clotrimazole. No single-step or multiple-step resistance to clotrimazole has developed during successive passages of Candida albicans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes . No appreciable change in sensitivity was detected after successive passage of isolates of C. albicans, C krusei , or C. pseudotropicalis in liquid or solid media containing clotrimazole. Also, resistance could not be developed in chemically induced mutant strains of polyene-resistant isolates of C. albicans . Slight, reversible resistance was noted in three isolates of C. albicans tested by one investigator. There is a single report that records the clinical emergence of C. albicans strain with considerable resistance to flucytosine and micronazole, and with cross-resistance to clotrimazole, the strain remained sensitive to nystatin and amphotericin B. In studies of the mechanism of action, the minimum fungicide concentration of clotrimazole caused leakage of intracellular phosphorus compounds into the ambient medium with concomitant breakdown of cellular nucleic acids and accelerated potassium efflux. Both these events began rapidly and extensively after addition of the drug. Clotrimazole appears to be well absorbed in humans following oral administration and is eliminated mainly as inactive metabolites. Following topical and vaginal administration, however, clotrimazole appears to be minimally absorbed. Six hours after the application of radioactive clotrimazole 1% cream and 1% solution onto intact and acutely inflamed skin, the concentration of clotrimazole varied from 100 mcg/cm 3 in the stratum corneum to 0.5 to 1 mcg/cm 3 in the stratum reticulare, and 0.1 mcg/cm 3 in the subcutis. No measurable amount of radioactivity (\u22640.001 mcg/mL) was found in the serum within 48 hours after application under occlusive dressing of 0.5 mL of the solution or 0.8 g of the cream. Only 0.5% or less of the applied radioactivity was excreted in the urine. Following intravaginal administration of 100 mg 14 C-clotrimazole vaginal tablets to nine adult females, an average peak serum level, corresponding to only 0.03 \u03bcg equivalent/mL of clotrimazole, was reached one to two days after application. After intravaginal administration of 5 g of 1% 14 C-clotrimazole vaginal cream containing 50 mg active drug, to five subjects (one with candidal colpitis), serum levels corresponding to approximately 0.01 \u03bcg equivalents/mL were reached between 8 and 24 hours after application."], "manufacturer_name": ["A-S Medication Solutions"], "substance_name": ["CLOTRIMAZOLE"], "effective_time": "20250206", "product_ndc": ["50090-7343"], "brand_name": ["Clotrimazole"]}

Structure of Element"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of action: Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Onset of anesthesia: Lidocaine Ointment 5% effects local, topical anesthesia. The onset of action is 3 to 5 minutes. It is ineffective when applied to intact skin. Hemodynamics: Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. Pharmacokinetics and metabolism: Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration, and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-l- acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6.0 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity."], "manufacturer_name": ["Alembic Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE"], "effective_time": "20231030", "product_ndc": ["62332-424"], "brand_name": ["LIDOCAINE"]}

The chemical name for diclofenac sodium is: Sodium [ o- (2,6-dichloranilino) phenyl] acetate Diclofenac sodium has a molecular weight of 318.13. The CAS number is CAS-15307-79-6. The structural formula is represented below: Diclofenac sodium topical gel, 3% also contains benzyl alcohol, sodium hyaluronate, polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether, and purified water. 1 g of diclofenac sodium topical gel, 3% contains 30 mg of the active substance, diclofenac sodium.

Each patient was administered 0.5 g of diclofenac sodium topical gel twice a day for up to 105 days. There were up to three 5 cm x 5 cm treatment sites per patient on the face, forehead, hands, forearm, and scalp. Serum concentrations of diclofenac were, on average, at or below 20 ng/mL. Distribution Diclofenac binds tightly to serum albumin. Metabolism Biotransformation of diclofenac following oral administration involves conjugation at the carboxyl group of the side chain or single or multiple hydroxylations resulting in several phenolic metabolites, most of which are converted to glucuronide conjugates. Two of these phenolic metabolites are biologically active, however to a much smaller extent than diclofenac. Metabolism of diclofenac following topical administration is thought to be similar to that after oral administration.

Nystatin is a polyene antimycotic obtained from Streptomyces noursei. It is a yellow to light tan powder with a cereal-like odor, very slightly soluble in water, and slightly to sparingly soluble in alcohol.

Structural formula: Each gram of Nystatin and Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment provides 100,000 USP Nystatin units and 1 mg Triamcinolone Acetonide in an ointment base of mineral oil and white petrolatum."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Nystatin: Nystatin exerts its antifungal activity against a variety of pathogenic and nonpathogenic yeasts and fungi by binding to sterols in the cell membrane. The binding process renders the cell membrane incapable of functioning as a selective barrier. Nystatin provides specific anticandidal activity to Candida (Monilia) albicans and other Candida species, but is not active against bacteria, protozoa, trichomonads, or viruses. Nystatin is not absorbed from intact skin or mucous membranes. Triamcinolone Acetonide: Triamcinolone acetonide is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions, characteristic of the topical corticosteroid class of drugs. The pharmacologic effects of the topical corticosteroids are well known; however, the mechanisms of their dermatologic actions are unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics: the extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys.

Acyclovir Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Acyclovir is an antiviral drug active against \u03b1-herpesviruses [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A clinical pharmacology study was performed with ZOVIRAX Cream in adult volunteers to evaluate the percutaneous absorption of acyclovir. In this study, which included 6 male volunteers, the cream was applied to an area of 710 cm 2 on the backs of the volunteers 5 times daily at intervals of 2 hours for a total of 4 days. The weight of cream applied and urinary excretion of acyclovir were measured daily. Plasma concentration of acyclovir was assayed 1 hour after the final application. The average daily urinary excretion of acyclovir was approximately 0.04% of the daily applied dose. Plasma acyclovir concentrations were below the limit of detection (0.01 \u03bcM) in 5 subjects and barely detectable (0.014 \u03bcM) in 1 subject. Systemic absorption of acyclovir from ZOVIRAX Cream is minimal in adults. The systemic absorption of acyclovir following topical application of cream has not been evaluated in patients <18 years of age. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action: Acyclovir is a synthetic purine deoxynucleoside analogue with cell culture and in vivo inhibitory activity against HSV types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) DNA polymerases. It inhibits HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication in cell culture and in vivo. The inhibitory activity of acyclovir is selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV. This viral enzyme converts acyclovir into acyclovir monophosphate, a deoxynucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In biochemical assays, acyclovir triphosphate inhibits replication of \u03b1-herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, 2) incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain, and 3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the susceptibility of herpes viruses to antivirals in cell culture and the clinical response to therapy has not been established in humans, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity testing results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit by 50% the growth of virus in cell culture (EC 50 value), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors. Using plaque-reduction assays on Vero cells, the EC 50 values of acyclovir against herpes simplex virus isolates range from 0.09 to 59.9 \u03bcM (0.02 to 13.5 \u03bcg/mL) for HSV-1 and from 0.04 to 44.0 \u03bcM (0.01 to 9.9 \u03bcg/mL) for HSV-2. Resistance In Cell Culture Acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains were isolated in cell culture. Acyclovir-resistant HSV resulted from mutations in the viral thymidine kinase (TK; pUL23) and DNA polymerase (POL; pUL30) genes. Frameshifts were commonly isolated and result in premature truncation of the HSV TK product with consequent decreased susceptibility to acyclovir. Mutations in the viral TK gene may lead to complete loss of TK activity (TK negative), reduced levels of TK activity (TK partial), or alteration in the ability of viral TK to phosphorylate the drug without an equivalent loss in the ability to phosphorylate thymidine (TK altered). In cell culture the following resistance-associated substitutions in TK of HSV-1 and HSV-2 were observed (Table 1). Table 1: Summary of Acyclovir (ACV) Resistance-associated Amino Acid Substitutions in Cell Culture HSV-1 TK P5A, H7Q, L50V, G56V, G59A, G61A, K62N, T63A, E83K, P84S, D116N, P131S, R163H, A167V, P173L, Q185R, R216S, R220H, T245M, R281stop, T287M, M322K HSV-2 TK L69P, C172R, T288M HSV-1 POL D368A, Y557S, E597D, V621S, L702H, N815S, V817M, G841C HSV-2 POL - In HSV-Infected Patients Clinical HSV-1 and HSV-2 isolates obtained from patients who failed treatment for their \u03b1-herpesvirus infections were evaluated for genotypic changes in the TK and POL genes and for phenotypic resistance to acyclovir (Table 2). HSV isolates with frameshift mutations and resistance-associated substitutions in TK and POL were identified. The listing of substitutions in HSV TK and POL leading to decreased susceptibility to acyclovir is not all inclusive and additional changes will likely be identified in HSV variants isolated from patients who fail acyclovir-containing regimens. The possibility of viral resistance to acyclovir should be considered in patients who fail to respond or experience recurrent viral shedding during therapy.

In 1 of these studies, which included 16 inpatients, the complete ointment or its vehicle were randomly administered in a dose of 1-cm strips (25 mg acyclovir) 4 times a day for 7 days to an intact skin surface area of 4.5 square inches. No local intolerance, systemic toxicity, or contact dermatitis were observed. In addition, no drug was detected in blood and urine by radioimmunoassay (sensitivity, 0.01 mcg/mL). The other study included 11 patients with localized varicella-zoster infections. In this uncontrolled study, acyclovir was detected in the blood of 9 patients and in the urine of all patients tested. Acyclovir levels in plasma ranged from < 0.01 to 0.28 mcg/mL in 8 patients with normal renal function, and from < 0.01 to 0.78 mcg/mL in 1 patient with impaired renal function.

Read this Instructions for Use before you start using diclofenac sodium topical gel and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Your healthcare provider has prescribed diclofenac sodium topical gel to help relieve arthritis pain in some of your joints. Diclofenac sodium topical gel may be used to treat arthritis pain in the arms (hands, wrists, and elbows) and in the legs (feet, ankles, and knees). It is not known if diclofenac sodium topical gel is safe and effective if used on your spine, hips, or shoulders. Use diclofenac sodium topical gel exactly how your healthcare provider prescribes it for you. Do not apply diclofenac sodium topical gel anywhere other than where your healthcare provider tells you to. Do not use more than a total of 32 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel each day. If you add up the amount of diclofenac sodium topical gel as directed by your healthcare provider, it should not be more than 32 grams in one day. The dose for your hands, wrists, or elbows is 2 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel each time you apply it. Apply diclofenac sodium topical gel 4 times a day (a total of 8 grams each day). Do not apply more than 8 grams each day to any one of your affected hands, wrists, or elbows. Some examples of diclofenac sodium topical gel application include: If you use 2 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel on one hand, 4 times a day, your total dose for one day is 8 grams. If you use 4 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel on one knee, 4 times a day, your total dose for one day is 16 grams. Your total dose for one day, treating one hand and one knee, is 8 grams plus 16 grams, which equals 24 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel. Before you use a new tube of diclofenac sodium topical gel for the first time, open the foil seal that covers the tube opening by using the spiked top of the cap. Remember to remove the dosing card from the carton to measure your dose (see Figure A). Apply diclofenac sodium topical gel to clean, dry skin that does not have any cuts, open wounds, infections, or rashes. Do not use heating pads or apply bandages to where you have applied diclofenac sodium topical gel. Avoid exposing skin where you apply diclofenac sodium topical gel to sunlight and artificial light, such as tanning booths. Do not use sunscreens, cosmetics, lotions, moisturizers, insect repellants, or other topical medicines on the same skin areas where you have applied diclofenac sodium topical gel. Do not get diclofenac sodium topical gel in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Diclofenac sodium topical gel is only to be used on your skin (topical use). If you get diclofenac sodium topical gel in your eyes, rinse your eyes right away with water or saline. Talk with your healthcare provider if eye irritation lasts for more than one hour. What if I miss a dose? If you miss a dose of diclofenac sodium topical gel, continue with your next scheduled dose using the prescribed amount of diclofenac sodium topical gel. Do not double the dose. Applying 2 grams (2 g) of diclofenac sodium topical gel to hands, wrists, or elbows: Step 1. Remove the dosing card that is attached inside the diclofenac sodium topical gel carton. Use the dosing card to correctly measure each dose of diclofenac sodium topical gel. To measure the correct amount of diclofenac sodium topical gel, place the dosing card on a flat surface so that you can read the print. If the print is backwards, flip dosing card over (see Figure A). If you lose or misplace your dosing card, you can ask your pharmacist for a new one or call 1-866-604-3268. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist to show you how to correctly measure your dose of diclofenac sodium topical gel while you are waiting to receive your new dosing card. Step 2. Squeeze diclofenac sodium topical gel onto the dosing card evenly, up to the 2 g line (a 2.25 inch length of gel). Make sure that the gel covers the 2 g area of the dosing card (see Figure B). Put the cap back on the tube of diclofenac sodium topical gel. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are not sure how to correctly measure your dose of diclofenac sodium topical gel. Step 3. Apply the gel to your hand, wrist, or elbow. You can use the dosing card to apply the gel (see Figure C). Then, use your hands to gently rub the gel into the skin (see Figure D). Do not share your dosing card with another person. Make sure to cover the entire affected hand, wrist, or elbow with the gel. Remember that the hand includes the palm of your hand, the top of your hand, and your fingers. Step 4. After using the dosing card, hold end with fingertips, rinse and dry. Store the dosing card until next use. Do not shower or bathe for at least 1 hour after applying diclofenac sodium topical gel. Do not wash your treated hands for at least 1 hour after applying the diclofenac sodium topical gel. Step 5. After applying diclofenac sodium topical gel, wait 10 minutes before covering the treated skin with gloves or clothing. Applying 4 grams (4 g) of diclofenac sodium topical gel to feet, ankles, or knees: Step 1. Refer to Step 1 above. Step 2. Squeeze diclofenac sodium topical gel onto the dosing card evenly up to the 4 g line (a 4.5 inch length of gel), making sure the gel covers the 4 g area of the dosing card (see Figure E). Put the cap back on the tube of diclofenac sodium topical gel. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are not sure how to correctly measure your dose of diclofenac sodium topical gel. Step 3. Apply diclofenac sodium topical gel to your foot, ankle, or knee. You can use the dosing card to apply the gel (see Figure F). Then, use your hands to gently rub the gel into the skin (see Figure G). Do not share your dosing card with another person. Make sure to cover your entire foot, ankle, or knee area with the gel. For example, cover the skin above, below, inside and outside the knee cap. Remember that the foot includes the sole of your foot, the top of your foot, and your toes. Refer to Steps 4 and 5 above. Wash your hands after applying diclofenac sodium topical gel to your foot, ankle, or knee. What are the ingredients in diclofenac sodium topical gel?

Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium were assessed in healthy volunteers following repeated applications during 7 days of diclofenac sodium topical gel to 1 knee (4 x 4 g per day) or to 2 knees and 2 hands (4 x 12 g per day) versus the recommended oral dose of diclofenac sodium for the treatment of osteoarthritis (3 x 50 mg per day). A summary of the pharmacokinetic parameters is presented in Table 2. Table 3. Pharmacokinetic Parameters and Comparison of Diclofenac Sodium Topical Gel to Oral Diclofenac Sodium Tablets After Repeated Administration C max = maximum plasma concentration, t max =time of C max . AUC 0-24 =area under the concentration time curve. SD=standard deviation. CI=confidence interval.

Systemic exposure with recommended use of diclofenac sodium topical gel (4 x 4 g per day applied to 1 knee) is on average 17 times lower than with oral treatment. (Basis: treatment with diclofenac sodium topical gel of 1 knee, 4 times a day versus 50 mg, 3 times a day of oral diclofenac tablets.) The amount of diclofenac sodium that is systemically absorbed from diclofenac sodium topical gel is on average 6% of the systemic exposure from an oral form of diclofenac sodium. The average peak plasma concentration with recommended use of diclofenac sodium topical gel (4 x 4 g per day applied to 1 knee) is 158 times lower than with the oral treatment. The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical gel has been tested under conditions of moderate heat (application of a heat patch for 15 minutes prior to gel application) and of moderate exercise (first gel application followed by a 20-minute treadmill exercise). No clinically relevant differences of systemic absorption and of tolerability were found between applications of diclofenac sodium topical gel (4 x 4 g per day on 1 knee) with and under the conditions tested. However, the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical gel was not tested under the condition of heat application following gel application. Therefore, concurrent use of diclofenac sodium topical gel and heat is not recommended.

The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bryant Ranch Prepack"], "substance_name": ["BETAMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE"], "effective_time": "20240312", "product_ndc": ["72162-1415"], "brand_name": ["BETAMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE"]}

Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension is an odorless, clear to slightly off-white suspension. chemical-structure-1 chemical-structure-2"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension combines the pharmacological effects of calcipotriene hydrate as a synthetic vitamin D 3 analog and betamethasone dipropionate as a synthetic corticosteroid. However, while their pharmacologic and clinical effects are known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in the treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body are unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: HPA axis suppression was evaluated in four trials (Trial A, B, C, and D) following the application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension. In all these trials, adrenal suppression was defined by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u226418 mcg/dL. \u2022 In Trial A, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=32) with extensive psoriasis involving at least 30% of the scalp and, in total, 15-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body for 4 to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression was observed in 5 of 32 subjects (16%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in 2 of 11 subjects (18%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks. \u2022 In Trial B, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=43) with extensive psoriasis involving 15-30% of the body surface area (including the scalp). Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension to the body (including the scalp in 36 out of 43 subjects) for 4 to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression was observed in 3 out of 43 subjects (7%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in none of the 36 subjects (0%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks. \u2022 In Trial C, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years (N=30) with plaque psoriasis of the scalp involving at least 20% of the scalp area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension to the affected area on the scalp for up to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression was observed in 1 of 30 evaluable subjects (3%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in no subjects (0%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . \u2022 In Trial D, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in a subset of pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years (N=31) with plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body involving 10% to 29% of the body surface area. Adrenal suppression was observed in 5 of 31 subjects (16%): 3 subjects after 4 weeks of treatment, 1 subject after 8 weeks of treatment, and 1 subject after both 4 and 8 weeks of treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Effects on Calcium Metabolism The effect on calcium metabolism was evaluated following the application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension (these trials are described above). \u2022 In Trial A, elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in two subjects (one at 4 weeks and one at 8 weeks). \u2022 In Trial B, there was no change in mean serum or urinary calcium levels. Elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in two subjects (one at 4 weeks and one at 8 weeks). \u2022 In Trial C (N=109), including 31 subjects with at least 20% scalp involvement and 78 subjects with at least 10% scalp involvement, no cases of hypercalcemia and no clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The systemic effect of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in psoriasis was investigated in Trials A and B [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . In Trial A, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 and 8 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated. However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 10 of 34 (29%) subjects at week 4 and in 5 of 12 (42%) subjects at week 8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (56%) subjects at week 4 and 7 of 12 (58%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. In Trial B, the plasma levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension. Calcipotriene and its metabolite MC1080 were below the lower limit of quantification in all plasma samples. Betamethasone dipropionate was quantifiable in 4 of 43 (9%) subjects. The metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate (B17P) was quantifiable in 16 of 43 (37%) subjects. The plasma concentrations of betamethasone dipropionate ranged from 30.9-63.5 pg/mL and that of its metabolite betamethasone 17-propionate ranged from 30.5-257 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Elimination Metabolism Calcipotriene: Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent compound. Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the \u03b1,\u00df-unsaturated ketone analog of calcipotriene), which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone analog). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid. Betamethasone dipropionate: Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6\u00df-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite.

The release liner is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 10 cm x 14 cm. Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol:water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: purified water, glycerin, sorbitol, polyacrylic acid, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium polyacrylate, propylene glycol, urea, kaolin, tartaric acid, gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, edetate disodium, methylparaben, and propylparaben. molecule"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of a lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When Lidocan\u2122 IV is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). graphs"], "manufacturer_name": ["PURETEK CORPORATION"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE"], "effective_time": "20241025", "product_ndc": ["59088-910"], "brand_name": ["Lidocan IV"]}

The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systematically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."], "manufacturer_name": ["PureTek Corporation"], "substance_name": ["HYDROCORTISONE"], "effective_time": "20240315", "product_ndc": ["59088-328"], "brand_name": ["Hydroxate Gel"]}

Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 33 years of age) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once-daily applications during a 4-week period with, on average, 2.3 grams/day (range 1.6 to 3.1 grams/day) of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel applied as a thin layer to the face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back. After a 4-week treatment, 16 subjects (62%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, with a mean C max of 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL and a mean AUC 0-24hr of 2.49 \u00b1 1.21 ng.h/mL. The most exposed subject had adapalene C max and AUC 0-24hr of 0.35 ng/mL and 6.41 ng.h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine.

Chemically, tretinoin is all-trans-retinoic acid, also known as (all-E)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl)-2,4,6,8-nonatetraenoic acid. It is a member of the retinoid class of compounds and a metabolite of vitamin A. Tretinoin has the following chemical structure: Molecular Formula: C 20 H 28 O 2 Molecular Weight: 300.44 Each gram of ALTRENO contains 0.5 mg (0.05%) of tretinoin in an opaque, pale yellow lotion base consisting of benzyl alcohol, butylated hydroxytoluene, carbomer copolymer type B (Pemulen TR-1), carbomer homopolymer type A (Carbopol 981), glycerin, methylparaben, mineral oil, octoxynol-9, purified water, sodium hyaluronate, soluble collagen and trolamine. chemstructure.jpg"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tretinoin is a metabolite of vitamin A that binds with high affinity to specific retinoic acid receptors located in both the cytosol and nucleus. Tretinoin activates three members of the retinoic acid (RAR) nuclear receptors (RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3) which act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation. It has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors, other mechanisms, or both. Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin in acne treatment is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of ALTRENO in the treatment of acne vulgaris are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its major metabolites (isotretinoin and 4-oxo-isotretinoin) were evaluated in 20 subjects in an open-label, randomized, pharmacokinetic study. Subjects aged 10 years to less than 17 years old with acne vulgaris applied approximately 3.5 g of ALTRENO to the skin of the entire face (excluding eyes and lips), neck, upper chest, upper back and shoulders once daily for 14 days. Single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics were determined from samples drawn on Days 1 and 2 of dosing and steady-state PK characteristics were determined from samples drawn on Days 14 and 15 under maximal use conditions. The mean baseline corrected C max and AUC 0-t of tretinoin and its metabolites after once daily application of ALTRENO for 14 days are shown below: Compound Mean (\u00b1SD) C max (ng/mL) Mean (\u00b1SD) AUC 0-t (ng*h/mL) Tretinoin 0.33 (0.33) 6.46 (5.15) Isotretinoin 0.49 (0.66) 9.30 (9.95) 4-oxo-isotretinoin 0.57 (0.82) 14.51 (18.28) The mean concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites (isotretinoin and 4\u2011oxo\u2011isotretinoin) remain relatively stable and unchanged over the 24\u2011hour period after both the Day 1 dose and the Day 14 dose. Systemic concentrations of tretinoin appear to be at or near steady state by Day 14. Mean accumulation ratios of the baseline corrected AUC between Day 14 and Day 1 were 1.5, 4.5 and 7.3 for tretinoin, isotretinoin, and 4-oxo-isotretinoin, respectively."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bausch Health US, LLC"], "substance_name": ["TRETINOIN"], "effective_time": "20200302", "product_ndc": ["0187-0005"], "brand_name": ["Altreno"]}

Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol:water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base.

The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of a lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When Lidocan\u2122 V is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15).

A mild acidic vehicle lowers pH to increase protection against alkaline irritations and to provide a favorable environment for healing. Pharmacokinetics: Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration, and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation of the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjungation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexlidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentration of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL.

The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours have not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.

Each patient was administered 0.5 g of diclofenac sodium topical gel twice a day for up to 105 days. There were up to three 5 cm x 5 cm treatment sites per patient on the face, forehead, hands, forearm, and scalp. Serum concentrations of diclofenac were, on average, at or below 20 ng/mL. Distribution Diclofenac binds tightly to serum albumin. Metabolism Biotransformation of diclofenac following oral administration involves conjugation at the carboxyl group of the side chain or single or multiple hydroxylations resulting in several phenolic metabolites, most of which are converted to glucuronide conjugates. Two of these phenolic metabolites are biologically active, however to a much smaller extent than diclofenac. Metabolism of diclofenac following topical administration is thought to be similar to that after oral administration. The small amounts of diclofenac and its metabolites appearing in the plasma following topical administration makes the quantification of specific metabolites imprecise.

Structured Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Like other topical corticosteroids, fluticasone propionate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Fluticasone propionate is lipophilic and has a strong affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. It has weak affinity for the progesterone receptor, and virtually no affinity for the mineralocorticoid, estrogen, or androgen receptors. The therapeutic potency of glucocorticoids is related to the half-life of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex. The half-life of the fluticasone propionate-glucocorticoid receptor complex is approximately 10 hours. Studies performed with Fluticasone Propionate Cream indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids. Pharmacokinetics: Absorption: The activity of Fluticasone Propionate Cream is due to the parent drug, fluticasone propionate. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressing enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. In a human study of 12 healthy males receiving 12.5 g of 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream twice daily for 3 weeks, plasma levels were generally below the level of quantification (0.05 ng/mL). In another study of 6 healthy males administered 25 g of 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream under occlusion for 5 days, plasma levels of fluticasone ranged from 0.07 to 0.39 ng/mL. In an animal study using radiolabeled 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream and ointment preparations, rats received a topical dose of 1 g/kg for a 24-hour period. Total recovery of radioactivity was approximately 80% at the end of 7 days. The majority of the dose (73%) was recovered from the surface of the application site. Less than 1% of the dose was recovered in the skin at the application site. Approximately 5% of the dose was absorbed systemically through the skin. Absorption from the skin continued for the duration of the study (7 days), indicating a long retention time at the application site. Distribution: Following intravenous administration of 1 mg fluticasone propionate in healthy volunteers, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The apparent volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg (range, 2.3 to 16.7 L/kg). The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Metabolism: No metabolites of fluticasone propionate were detected in an in vitro study of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate incubated in a human skin homogenate. The total blood clearance of systemically absorbed fluticasone propionate averages 1,093 mL/min (range, 618 to 1,702 mL/min) after a 1-mg intravenous dose, with renal clearance accounting for less than 0.02% of the total. Fluticasone propionate is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated hydrolysis of the 5-fluoromethyl carbothioate grouping. This transformation occurs in 1 metabolic step to produce the inactive 17-\u00df-carboxylic acid metabolite, the only known metabolite detected in man. This metabolite has approximately 2,000 times less affinity than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Excretion: Following intravenous dose of 1 mg in healthy volunteers, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had an average terminal half-life of 7.2 hours (range, 3.2 to 11.2 hours)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc."], "substance_name": ["FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE"], "effective_time": "20220505", "product_ndc": ["0713-0631"], "brand_name": ["Fluticasone Propionate"]}

Chemically, imiquimod is 1-(2-methylpropyl)-1 H -imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine. Imiquimod has a molecular formula of C 14 H 16 N 4 and a molecular weight of 240.3. Its structural formula is: Image 11"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of Imiquimod Cream in treating AK, sBCC, and EGW lesions is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Actinic Keratosis In a trial of 18 subjects with AK comparing imiquimod cream to vehicle, increases from baseline in Week 2 biomarker levels were reported for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11c, and CD68 for imiquimod-treated subjects; however, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma An open-label trial in 6 subjects with sBCC suggests that treatment with imiquimod cream may increase the infiltration of lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages into the tumor lesion; however, the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. External Genital Warts Imiquimod has no direct antiviral activity in cell culture. A trial in 22 subjects with EGW comparing imiquimod cream and vehicle shows that imiquimod cream induces mRNA encoding cytokines including interferon-\u0251 at the treatment site. In addition, HPVL1 mRNA and HPV DNA are significantly decreased following treatment. However, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of imiquimod across the affected skin of 58 subjects with AK was observed with a dosing frequency of 3 applications per week for 16 weeks. Mean peak serum drug concentrations at the end of Week 16 were approximately 0.1, 0.2, and 3.5 ng/mL for the applications to face (12.5 mg imiquimod, 1 unit-dose packet), scalp (25 mg, 2 packets), and hands/arms (75 mg, 6 packets), respectively.

Dose proportionality was not observed. However, it appears that systemic exposure may be more dependent on surface area of application than amount of applied dose. The apparent half-life was approximately 10 times greater with topical dosing than the 2-hour apparent half-life seen following subcutaneous dosing, suggesting prolonged retention of drug in the skin. Mean urinary recoveries of imiquimod and metabolites combined were 0.08% and 0.15% of the applied dose in the group using 75 mg (6 packets) for males and females, respectively following 3 applications per week for 16 weeks. Systemic absorption of imiquimod was observed across the affected skin of 12 subjects with genital/perianal warts, with an average dose of 4.6 mg. Mean peak drug concentration of approximately 0.4 ng/mL was seen during the trial.

A mild acidic vehicle lowers pH to increase protection against alkaline irritations and to provide a favorable environment for healing. Pharmacokinetics: Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration, and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation of the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjungation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexlidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentration of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey, arterial blood levels of 18-21 g/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity."], "manufacturer_name": ["PureTek Corporation"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240405", "product_ndc": ["59088-234"], "brand_name": ["Bruselix Cream"]}

In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor added to bupivacaine to slow absorption into the general circulation and thus prolong maintenance of an active tissue concentration. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic absorption of bupivacaine produces effects on the cardiovascular system and CNS. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. These cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Following systemic absorption, bupivacaine can produce CNS stimulation, CNS depression, or both. Apparent central stimulation is manifested as restlessness, tremors, and shivering, progressing to convulsions, followed by CNS depression and coma progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest. However, bupivacaine has a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited state. The duration of local anesthesia after administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is longer than that observed after administration of other commonly used short-acting local anesthetics. There appears to be period of analgesia that persists after the resolution of the block and return of sensation. The onset of action following dental injections is usually 2 to 10 minutes and may last up to 7 hours. The duration of anesthetic effect is prolonged by the addition of epinephrine 1:200,000. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection do not correlate with local efficacy. Absorption The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000) usually reduces the rate of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine, permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and sometimes prolonging the duration of action [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After injection of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next three to six hours. Distribution Bupivacaine appears to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of bupivacaine appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity (95%) has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4). The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, bupivacaine is distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profile of bupivacaine after direct intravenous injection (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is not approved for intravenous use) suggest a three-compartment open model. The first compartment is represented by the rapid intravascular distribution of the drug. The second compartment represents the equilibration of the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as the brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and liver. The third compartment represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly perfused tissues, such as muscle and fat. Elimination The half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours. Metabolism Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine. The elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely upon the availability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized. Excretion The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Elderly patients exhibited higher peak plasma concentrations than younger patients following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection. The total plasma clearance was decreased in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic disease. Patients with hepatic disease, especially those with severe hepatic disease, may be more susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local anesthetics [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of renal disease, factors affecting urinary pH, and renal blood flow [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.7) ] .", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt retaining properties, are used in replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are used primarily for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine hydrochloride stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine hydrochloride is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine hydrochloride is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine hydrochloride crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine hydrochloride. Approximately 90% of lidocaine hydrochloride administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine hydrochloride following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine hydrochloride required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl\u203e) ions. These ions are normal constituents of the body fluids (principally extracellular) and are essential for maintaining electrolyte balance.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that is used for the treatment of dermal infections caused by various species of pathogenic dermatophytes, yeasts, and Malassezia furfur . The primary action of clotrimazole is against dividing and growing organisms. In vitro , clotrimazole exhibits fungistatic and fungicidal activity against isolates of Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, and Candida species including Candida albicans . In general, the in vitro activity of clotrimazole corresponds to that of tolnaftate and griseofulvin against the mycelia of dermatophytes ( Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton), and to that of the polyenes (amphotericin B and nystatin) against budding fungi ( Candida ). Using an in vivo (mouse) and an in vitro (mouse kidney homogenate) testing system, clotrimazole and miconazole were equally effective in preventing the growth of the pseudomycelia and mycelia of Candida albicans . Strains of fungi having a natural resistance to clotrimazole are rare. Only a single isolate of Candida guilliermondi has been reported to have primary resistance to clotrimazole. No single-step or multiple-step resistance to clotrimazole has developed during successive passages of Candida albicans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes . No appreciable change in sensitivity was detected after successive passages of isolates of C. albicans, C. krusei, or C. pseudotropicalis in liquid or solid media containing clotrimazole. Also, resistance could not be developed in chemically induced mutant strains of polyene-resistant isolates of C. albicans . Slight, reversible resistance was noted in three isolates of C. albicans tested by one investigator. There is a single report that records the clinical emergence of a C. albicans strain with considerable resistance to flucytosine and miconazole, and with cross-resistance to clotrimazole; the strain remained sensitive to nystatin and amphotericin B. In studies of the mechanism of action, the minimum fungicidal concentration of clotrimazole caused leakage of intracellular phosphorus compounds into the ambient medium with concomitant breakdown of cellular nucleic acids and accelerated potassium efflux. Both these events began rapidly and extensively after addition of the drug. Clotrimazole appears to be well absorbed in humans following oral administration and is eliminated mainly as inactive metabolites. Following topical and vaginal administration, however, clotrimazole appears to be minimally absorbed. Six hours after the application of radioactive clotrimazole 1% cream and 1% solution onto intact and acutely inflamed skin, the concentration of clotrimazole varied from 100 mcg/cm 3 , in the stratum corneum to 0.5 mcg/cm 3 to 1 mcg/cm 3 in the stratum reticulare, and 0.1 mcg/cm 3 in the subcutis.

Chemically, clotrimazole, USP is 1-( o -Chloro-\u03b1,\u03b1-diphenylbenzyl)imidazole, with the molecular formula C 22 H 17 ClN 2 , a molecular weight of 344.84, and the following structural formula: Clotrimazole, USP is an odorless, white crystalline powder, insoluble in water and soluble in ethanol.

Betamethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action for the treatment of tinea pedis, tinea cruris and tinea corporis is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstrictor Assay Studies performed with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream indicate that these topical combination antifungal/corticosteroids may have vasoconstrictor potencies in a range that is comparable to high-potency topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Skin penetration and systemic absorption of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate following topical application of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream has not been studied. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Once absorbed through the skin, the pharmacokinetics of topical corticosteroids are similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Clotrimazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits 14-\u03b1-demethylation of lanosterol in fungi by binding to one of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes. This leads to the accumulation of 14-\u03b1-methylsterols and reduced concentrations of ergosterol, a sterol essential for a normal fungal cytoplasmic membrane. The methylsterols may affect the electron transport system, thereby inhibiting growth of fungi. Activity In Vitro and In Vivo Clotrimazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following dermatophytes, both in vitro and in clinical infections, Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton rubrum [see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Drug Resistance Strains of dermatophytes having a natural resistance to clotrimazole have not been reported. Resistance to azoles, including clotrimazole, has been reported in some Candida species. No single-step or multiple-step resistance to clotrimazole has developed during successive passages of Trichophyton mentagrophytes."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bryant Ranch Prepack"], "substance_name": ["BETAMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE", "CLOTRIMAZOLE"], "effective_time": "20240510", "product_ndc": ["63629-8758"], "brand_name": ["Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate"]}

The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium topical solution, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro . Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After administration of diclofenac sodium topical solution (40 mg/knee every 12 h; total daily diclofenac exposure: 80 mg/knee) for 7.5 days, the mean (SD) AUC 0-12 and mean (SD) C max were 77.27 (49.89) ng\u2022h/mL and 12.16 (7.66) ng/mL, respectively, on Day 1; and 204.58 (111.02) ng\u2022h/mL and 25.24 (12.95) ng/mL, respectively, at steady state on Day 8. After administration of diclofenac sodium 1.5% topical solution (19.3 mg/knee every 6 h; total daily diclofenac exposure 77.2 mg/knee), the mean (SD) AUC 0-12 and mean (SD) C max were 27.46 (23.97) ng\u2022h/mL and 2.30 (2.02) ng/mL, respectively, on Day 1; and 141.49 (92.47) ng\u2022h/mL and 17.04 (11.28) ng/mL, respectively, at steady state on Day 8. The pharmacokinetics and effect of diclofenac sodium topical solution were not evaluated under the conditions of heat application, occlusive dressings overlay, or exercise following product application. Therefore, concurrent use of diclofenac sodium topical solution under these conditions is not recommended. Distribution: Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac. Elimination Metabolism: Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CYP2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. Excretion: Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine.

The binding process renders the cell membrane incapable of functioning as a selective barrier. Nystatin provides specific anticandidal activity to Candida (Monilia) albicans and other Candida species, but is not active against bacteria, protozoa, trichomonads, or viruses. Nystatin is not absorbed from intact skin or mucous membranes. Triamcinolone Acetonide Triamcinolone acetonide is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions, characteristic of the topical corticosteroid class of drugs. The pharmacologic effects of the topical corticosteroids are well known; however, the mechanisms of their dermatologic actions are unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics the extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.

Hydrocortisone butyrate is a corticosteroid. The chemical name of hydrocortisone butyrate is Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,21-dihydroxy-17-[(1-oxobutyl)oxy(11\u03b2)-]. It has the following structural formula: Hydrocortisone butyrate is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 432.56, and a molecular formula of C 25 H 36 O 6 . It is practically insoluble in water, slightly soluble in ether, soluble in methanol, alcohol, and acetone, and freely soluble in chloroform. Each gram of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion contains 1 mg of hydrocortisone butyrate in a white to off-white lotion base consisting of anhydrous citric acid, ceteth-20, cetostearyl alcohol, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylparaben, light mineral oil, propylparaben, purified water, sodium citrate, and white petrolatum. Structural formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action in atopic dermatitis is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion is unknown. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression Eighty-four (84) pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis affecting at least 25% of body surface area (BSA) treated with Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion three times daily for up to 4 weeks were assessed for HPA axis suppression. The disease severity (moderate to severe atopic dermatitis) and the dosing regimen (three times daily) in this HPA axis trial were different from the subject population (mild to moderate atopic dermatitis) and the dosing regimen (twice daily) for which Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion is indicated. Seven of the 82 evaluable subjects (8.5%) demonstrated laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, where the criterion for defining HPA axis suppression was a serum cortisol level of less than or equal to 18 mcg/dL after cosyntropin stimulation. Subjects with HPA axis suppression ranged from 1 to 12 years of age and, at the time of enrollment, had 35% to 90% BSA involvement. These subjects did not develop any other signs or symptoms of HPA axis suppression. At the first follow-up visit, approximately 1 month after the conclusion of treatment, cosyntropin stimulation results of all subjects had returned to normal, with the exception of one subject. This last subject recovered adrenal function by the second post-treatment visit, 55 days post-treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No studies were conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed through normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin, occlusive dressings, or widespread application may increase percutaneous absorption. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids."], "manufacturer_name": ["The J.

NOTE: Gentamicin Sulfate is a bactericidal agent that is not effective against viruses or fungi in skin infections. It is useful in the treatment of infected skin cysts and certain other skin abscesses when preceded by incision and drainage to permit adequate contact between the antibiotic and the infecting bacteria. Good results have been obtained in the treatment of infected stasis and other skin ulcers, infected superficial burns, paronychia, infected insect bites and stings, infected lacerations and abrasions and wounds from minor surgery. Patients sensitive to neomycin can be treated with Gentamicin Sulfate, although regular observation of patients sensitive to topical antibiotics is advisable when such patients are treated with any topical antibiotic. Gentamicin sulfate cream is recommended for wet, oozing primary infections, and greasy, secondary infections, such as postular acne or infected seborrheic dermatitis.

All subjects returned to normal HPA axis function at follow-up 4 weeks after the end of treatment. Potassium Shifts from normal to elevated potassium levels were observed in 5% of clascoterone-treated subjects and 4% of vehicle-treated subjects. Cardiac Electrophysiology At approximately 2-times the systemic exposure observed with the maximum dose, WINLEVI cream does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following topical treatment of WINLEVI cream for 2 weeks with a mean dose of approximately 6 grams applied twice daily to adult subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris (n=20), systemic concentrations of clascoterone were at steady state by Day 5. On Day 14, the mean \u00b1 SD maximum plasma concentration (C max ) was 4.5 \u00b1 2.9 ng/mL, the mean \u00b1 SD area under the plasma concentration-time over the dosing interval (AUC \ua787 ) was 37.1 \u00b1 22.3 h*ng/mL and the mean \u00b1 SD average plasma concentration (C avg ) was 3.1 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of clascoterone is 84% to 89% and is independent of concentrations, in vitro. Elimination Metabolism Following topical treatment with WINLEVI cream, the plasma concentrations of cortexolone, a possible primary metabolite of clascoterone, were detectable and generally below or near the lower limit of quantitation (0.5 ng/mL) in subjects \u226512 years of age with acne vulgaris. The in vitro study indicated that incubation of 10 \u00b5mol/L clascoterone with human cryopreserved hepatocytes generated cortexolone as the possible primary metabolite and other unidentified metabolites, including conjugated metabolites. Excretion Excretion of clascoterone has not been fully characterized in humans. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients In adolescent subjects \u2265 12 to <18 years of age (n=22) after 2 weeks of twice daily treatment with mean dose of approximately 6 grams of WINLEVI cream (or mean dose of approximately 4 grams in younger, smaller subjects), steady-state concentrations of clascoterone were achieved by Day 5. Clascoterone systemic exposure in adolescents was similar to those observed in adults. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinical studies evaluating the drug interaction potential of WINLEVI cream have been conducted. In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes: Clascoterone inhibited CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4 with an IC 50 value of >40 \u00b5M. Clascoterone up to 30 \u00b5M did not induce CYP 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. These findings suggest that WINLEVI cream has no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of drugs metabolized by CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4."], "manufacturer_name": ["Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc."], "substance_name": ["CLASCOTERONE"], "effective_time": "20250102", "product_ndc": ["47335-994"], "brand_name": ["Winlevi"]}

The contribution to efficacy of individual components of the vehicle has not been established. Pharmacokinetics Absorption When diclofenac sodium gel is applied topically, diclofenac is absorbed into the epidermis. In a study in patients with compromised skin (mainly atopic dermatitis and other dermatitic conditions) of the hands, arms or face, approximately 10% of the applied dose (2 grams of 3% gel over 100 cm\u00b2) of diclofenac was absorbed systemically in both normal and compromised epidermis after seven days, with four times daily applications. After topical application of 2 g diclofenac sodium gel three times daily for six days to the calf of the leg in healthy subjects, diclofenac could be detected in plasma. Mean bioavailability parameters were AUC 0-t 9\u00b119 ng/hr/mL (mean\u00b1SD) with a C max of 4\u00b15 ng/mL and a T max of 4.5\u00b18 hours. In comparison, a single oral 75 mg dose of diclofenac (Voltaren\u00ae)\u2020 produced an AUC of 1600 ng/hr/mL. Therefore, the systemic bioavailability after topical application of diclofenac sodium gel is lower than after oral dosing. Comparative bioavailability studies have not been conducted between available diclofenac topical products (gels containing 1 to 3% diclofenac) which have different dosing regimens. A cross-study evaluation of the data indicates that diclofenac is more bioavailable when applied to diseased skin and less bioavailable when applied to intact skin. Blood drawn at the end of treatment from 60 patients with AK lesions treated with diclofenac sodium gel in three adequate and well-controlled clinical trials was assayed for diclofenac levels. Each patient was administered 0.5 g of diclofenac sodium gel twice a day for up to 105 days. There were up to three 5 cm X 5 cm treatment sites per patient on the face, forehead, hands, forearm, and scalp. Serum concentrations of diclofenac were, on average, at or below 20 ng/mL. These data indicate that systemic absorption of diclofenac in patients treated topically with diclofenac sodium gel is much lower than that occurring after oral daily dosing of diclofenac sodium. No information is available on the absorption of diclofenac when diclofenac sodium gel is used under occlusion. Distribution Diclofenac binds tightly to serum albumin. The volume of distribution of diclofenac following oral administration is approximately 550 mL/kg. Metabolism Biotransformation of diclofenac following oral administration involves conjugation at the carboxyl group of the side chain or single or multiple hydroxylations resulting in several phenolic metabolites, most of which are converted to glucuronide conjugates. Two of these phenolic metabolites are biologically active, however to a much smaller extent than diclofenac. Metabolism of diclofenac following topical administration is thought to be similar to that after oral administration. The small amounts of diclofenac and its metabolites appearing in the plasma following topical administration makes the quantification of specific metabolites imprecise. Elimination Diclofenac and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine after oral dosing. Systemic clearance of diclofenac from plasma is 263\u00b156 mL/min (mean\u00b1SD).

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within one hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed Vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for Vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of Vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of Vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of Vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of Vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and Vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of Vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of Vitamin B 12 , and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract.

It also contains the following inactive ingredients: dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, glycerol, methylparaben, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, sodium polyacrylate, tartaric acid, water lidocaine menthol"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Lidocaine is a topical anesthetic and stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities. It also acts as a weak kappa (\u0138) opioid receptor agonist. Menthol chemically triggers the cold-\u00ad\u2010sensitive TRPM-\u00ad\u20108 receptors in the skin, which are responsible for the well-\u00ad\u2010documented cooling sensation that occurs when applied to the skin. Menthol\u2019s analgesic properties are not fully understood; however, they are mediated through a selective activation of \u0138-\u00ad\u2010opioid receptors. Menthol also blocks voltage-\u00ad\u2010sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue. Pharmacodynamics Menthol works by targeting the k-\u00ad\u2010opiod receptor on the TRPM8 neuron. The TRPM8 neuron is normally activated at temperatures between (8\u00b0 -\u00ad\u2010 28\u00b0 C). Menthol causes the neuron to fire at temperatures above normal activation, which triggers the characteristic cooling sensation. Also because of Menthol's specific targeting of the k-\u00ad\u2010opioid receptor, it is endowed with analgesic properties. Lidocaine is an amide-\u00ad\u2010type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of Lidocaine into intact skin after application of patch is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: The amount of Lidocaine and Menthol systemically absorbed is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three Lidocaine 5% patches were applied over an area of 420 cm2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for a determination of Lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in table 1. Repeated application of three days indicated that the Lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1.When Lidocaine 5% patch is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of Lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of Lidocaine is about 0.13 \u00b5g/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Figure 1 Mean Lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three Lidocaine 5% patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution: When Lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of Lidocaine Patch 5%, Lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-\u00ad\u20101-\u00ad\u2010acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 \u00b5g/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of Lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism: It is not known if Lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including menoethylglycinexylidie (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of Lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-\u00ad\u2010xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of Lidocaine Patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11% to 36% and from 5% to 11% of Lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Humans rapidly metabolize Menthols primarily in the liver by the microsomes, using the enzyme CYP2A6. Cytochrome P450-\u00ad\u2010mediated oxidation occurs in humans, yielding various alcohol and hydroxy acid derivatives. These are eliminated in the urine unchanged or conjugated with glucuronic acid. Excretion: Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of Lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-\u00ad\u2010life of Lidocaine elimination from plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n=15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n=15). Menthols are largely eliminated as glucuronides. In an experiment, 79% of a 1g (Quick, 1928) and 78% of a 10-\u00ad\u201020mg (Atzl et al., 1972) oral dose of Menthol was eliminated as the glucuronic acid conjugate within 6 h after administration to volunteers. Of a dose of 47 mg/kg bw [3-\u00ad\u20103H]-\u00ad\u2010(-\u00ad\u2010)-\u00ad\u2010Menthol, 82% was eliminated in the urine 17 hours after administration. Smaller amounts were distributed in the feces and ileum; only 1% of the activity remained in the liver (Clegg et al., 1982). table1 fig1 mentholpath"], "manufacturer_name": ["Clinic Pharma"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE", "MENTHOL"], "effective_time": "20240416", "product_ndc": ["83881-441"], "brand_name": ["LIDOTHOL"]}

Each gram of mometasone furoate cream 0.1% contains 1 mg mometasone furoate, USP in a cream base of hexylene glycol, phosphoric acid, propylene glycol stearate, stearyl alcohol and ceteareth-20, titanium dioxide, aluminum starch octenylsuccinate, white wax, white petrolatum, and purified water. Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Like other topical corticosteroids, mometasone furoate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies performed with mometasone furoate cream 0.1% indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids. In a study evaluating the effects of mometasone furoate cream on the HPA axis, 15 grams were applied twice daily for 7 days to six adult subjects with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. The cream was applied without occlusion to at least 30% of the body surface. The results showed that the drug caused a slight lowering of adrenal corticosteroid secretion [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Ninety-seven pediatric subjects ages 6 to 23 months with atopic dermatitis, were enrolled in an open-label, HPA axis safety study. Mometasone furoate cream 0.1% was applied once daily for approximately 3 weeks over a mean body surface area of 41% (range 15%-94%). In approximately 16% of subjects who showed normal adrenal function by Cortrosyn test before starting treatment, adrenal suppression was observed at the end of treatment with mometasone furoate cream 0.1%. The criteria for suppression were: basal cortisol level of \u22645 mcg/dL, 30-minute post-stimulation level of \u226418 mcg/dL, or an increase of <7 mcg/dL. Follow-up testing 2 to 4 weeks after stopping treatment, available for 5 of the subjects, demonstrated suppressed HPA axis function in one subject, using these same criteria [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Studies in humans indicate that approximately 0.4% of the applied dose of mometasone furoate cream 0.1% enters the circulation after 8 hours of contact on normal skin without occlusion. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption."], "manufacturer_name": ["A-S Medication Solutions"], "substance_name": ["MOMETASONE FUROATE"], "effective_time": "20230308", "product_ndc": ["50090-2991"], "brand_name": ["Mometasone Furoate"]}

Each patient was administered 0.5 g of diclofenac sodium topical gel twice a day for up to 105 days. There were up to three 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm treatment sites per patient on the face, forehead, hands, forearm, and scalp. Serum concentrations of diclofenac were, on average, at or below 20 ng/mL. Distribution Diclofenac binds tightly to serum albumin. Metabolism Biotransformation of diclofenac following oral administration involves conjugation at the carboxyl group of the side chain or single or multiple hydroxylations resulting in several phenolic metabolites, most of which are converted to glucuronide conjugates. Two of these phenolic metabolites are biologically active, however to a much smaller extent than diclofenac. Metabolism of diclofenac following topical administration is thought to be similar to that after oral administration. The small amounts of diclofenac and its metabolites appearing in the plasma following topical administration makes the quantification of specific metabolites imprecise.

It is intended for topical use only. Calcipotriene is a synthetic vitamin D 3 analogue. Chemically, calcipotriene is (5Z,7E,22E,24S)-24-cyclopropyl-9,10-secochola-5,7,10(19),22-tetraene-1 (alpha),3(beta),24-triol, with the empirical formula C 27 H 40 O 3 , a molecular weight of 412.3, and the following structural formula: Calcipotriene is a white to almost white crystalline compound.

However, while their pharmacologic and clinical effects are known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in plaque psoriasis are unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstriction: In a vasoconstrictor trial in healthy subjects, the skin blanching response of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was consistent with that of a potent corticosteroid when compared with other topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: HPA axis suppression was evaluated in four trials (Trial A, B, C and D) following the application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment. In Trial A, calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was applied once daily for 4 weeks to adult subjects (N = 12) with plaque psoriasis to study its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Of eleven subjects tested, none demonstrated adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u2264 18 mcg/dL. In Trial B, calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment was evaluated in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis (N = 19). One subject demonstrated adrenal suppression. In Trial C, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=32) with extensive plaque psoriasis involving at least 30% of the scalp and, in total, 15-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minutes post-stimulation cortisol level < 18 mcg/dL was observed in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment as per the recommended duration of use [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . In Trial D, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in subjects 12 to 17 years (N=32) with plaque psoriasis of the body involving 5-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment to the affected areas for up to 4 weeks. Mean weekly dose was 29.6 g with a range of 8.1-55.8 g/week. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level \u226418 mcg/dL was observed in none of 32 evaluable subjects after 4 weeks of treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Effects on Calcium Metabolism In Trial C described above, the effects of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp on calcium metabolism were also examined. Elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in 1 of 35 subjects (2.9%) after 4 weeks of treatment. In Trial D described above, calcium metabolism was evaluated in a total of 33 subjects aged 12 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis involving 5-30% of the body surface area who underwent once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment for up to 4 weeks. No cases of hypercalcemia and no clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported. However, one subject had a normal urinary calcium: creatinine ratio at baseline (3.75 mmol/g), which increased above the normal range at week 4 (16 mmol/g). There were no relevant changes in albumin-corrected serum calcium or other markers of calcium metabolism for this subject. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In Trial C described above, the systemic effect of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment in extensive plaque psoriasis was investigated. In this trial, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 weeks (maximum recommended duration of treatment) and also after 8 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body in combination with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp. Both calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated. However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 10 of 34 (29.4%) subjects at week 4 and in five of 12 (41.7%) subjects at week 8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (55.9%) subjects at week 4 and seven of 12 (58.3%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism Calcipotriene: Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent compound. Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone analogue of calcipotriene), which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone analogue). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid. Betamethasone dipropionate: Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6beta-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bryant Ranch Prepack"], "substance_name": ["BETAMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE", "CALCIPOTRIENE"], "effective_time": "20231207", "product_ndc": ["63629-2520"], "brand_name": ["Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate"]}

It has the following structural formula: chem"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate of absorption and percent of dose absorbed depending upon concentration and total dose administered, the specific site of application, and duration of exposure. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per ml, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma above 6 mcg free base per ml. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18-21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity."], "manufacturer_name": ["The J.

{"indications_and_usage": ["PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY Clindamycin Hydrochloride is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, which is 4 to 8 times more potent than Lincomycin. It has potent antibacterial activity to aerobic gram-positive bacterium, such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus diphtheriae and Bacillus anthracis. It also has good antibacterial activity to anaerobic gram-negative bacterium. Bacteroides (including bacteroides fragilis) and Clostridium are morbidly susceptible to it. It binds exclusively to the 50'S subunit of sensitive bacterial ribosome and suppresses protein synthesis. Clindamycin is a bacteriostat, but can kill high sensitive bacterium at high concentration. Metronidazole is an anti-anaerobic bacterial, anti-trichomonal and anti-amebic agent. Combination of Clindamycin Hydrochloride and Metronidazole can kill Propionibacterium acnes, Pityrosporum ovale, and some other sensitive bacterium and vermiform mite, and can inhibit them from growing. As a result, it can reduce the creation of lipase, and prevent triacylglycerol from hydrolyzing into free fatty acid.

The corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used topically as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents. Chemically, hydrocortisone valerate is C 26 H 38 O 6 . It has the following structural formula: Hydrocortisone valerate has a molecular weight of 446.58. It is a white to off-white crystalline powder, soluble in ethanol and methanol, sparingly soluble in propylene glycol and insoluble in water. Each gram of hydrocortisone valerate cream USP contains 2 mg hydrocortisone valerate USP in a hydrophilic base composed of carbomer homopolymer type C, dibasic sodium phosphate, methylparaben, polyoxyl 2 stearyl ether, propylene glycol, purified water, sodium lauryl sulfate, steareth-100, stearyl alcohol and white petrolatum. Hydrocortisone Valerate"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Like other topical corticosteroids, hydrocortisone valerate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours have not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. Studies performed with hydrocortisone valerate cream indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids."], "manufacturer_name": ["Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc."], "substance_name": ["HYDROCORTISONE VALERATE"], "effective_time": "20250320", "product_ndc": ["68180-954"], "brand_name": ["HYDROCORTISONE VALERATE"]}

Lidocaine is present in a 4% concentration (w/w). It is chemically designated as 2-\u00ad\u2010(diethylamino)-\u00ad\u2010N-\u00ad\u2010(2,6-\u00ad\u2010 dimethylphenyl) acetamide and has an empirical formula of C14H22N2O. The molecular weight of Lidocaine is 234.34 g/mol. Menthol is present in a 1% concentration (w/w). The chemical name is (1R,2S,5R)-\u00ad\u20102-\u00ad\u2010isopropyl-\u00ad\u20105-\u00ad\u2010methylcyclohexanol. The empirical formula for Menthol is C10H20O with a molecular weight of 156.27 g/mol. Lidothol (Lidocaine 4% / Menthol 1% Patch) consists of an adhesive hydrogel containing Lidocaine 4% and Menthol 1%, applied to flexible woven polyester backing and protected by a plastic film. The protective film is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 12cm x 8cm. Lidocaine is chemically designated as 2-\u00ad\u2010(diethylamino)-\u00ad\u2010N-\u00ad\u2010(2,6-\u00ad\u2010dimethylphenyl), has an octanol: water partition ration of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: Menthol is chemically designated as 2-\u00ad\u2010Isopropyl-\u00ad\u20105-\u00ad\u2010methylcyclohexanol. It contains colorless, hexagonal crystals, usually needle-\u00ad\u2010like; fused masses or crystalline powder with a pleasant, peppermint-\u00ad\u2010like odor. It has a melting point between 31\u00b0C to 36\u00b0 C. Menthol has the following structure: Each adhesive patch contains 76.5mg of Lidocaine and 85mg of Menthol. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, glycerol, methylparaben, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, sodium polyacrylate, tartaric acid, water lidocaine menthol"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Lidocaine is a topical anesthetic and stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities. It also acts as a weak kappa (\u0138) opioid receptor agonist. Menthol chemically triggers the cold-\u00ad\u2010sensitive TRPM-\u00ad\u20108 receptors in the skin, which are responsible for the well-\u00ad\u2010documented cooling sensation that occurs when applied to the skin. Menthol\u2019s analgesic properties are not fully understood; however, they are mediated through a selective activation of \u0138-\u00ad\u2010opioid receptors. Menthol also blocks voltage-\u00ad\u2010sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue. Pharmacodynamics Menthol works by targeting the k-\u00ad\u2010opiod receptor on the TRPM8 neuron. The TRPM8 neuron is normally activated at temperatures between (8\u00b0 -\u00ad\u2010 28\u00b0 C). Menthol causes the neuron to fire at temperatures above normal activation, which triggers the characteristic cooling sensation. Also because of Menthol's specific targeting of the k-\u00ad\u2010opioid receptor, it is endowed with analgesic properties. Lidocaine is an amide-\u00ad\u2010type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of Lidocaine into intact skin after application of patch is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: The amount of Lidocaine and Menthol systemically absorbed is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three Lidocaine 5% patches were applied over an area of 420 cm2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for a determination of Lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in table 1. Repeated application of three days indicated that the Lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1.When Lidocaine 5% patch is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of Lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of Lidocaine is about 0.13 \u00b5g/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Figure 1 Mean Lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three Lidocaine 5% patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution: When Lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of Lidocaine Patch 5%, Lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-\u00ad\u20101-\u00ad\u2010acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 \u00b5g/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of Lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism: It is not known if Lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including menoethylglycinexylidie (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of Lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-\u00ad\u2010xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of Lidocaine Patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11% to 36% and from 5% to 11% of Lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Humans rapidly metabolize Menthols primarily in the liver by the microsomes, using the enzyme CYP2A6. Cytochrome P450-\u00ad\u2010mediated oxidation occurs in humans, yielding various alcohol and hydroxy acid derivatives. These are eliminated in the urine unchanged or conjugated with glucuronic acid. Excretion: Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of Lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-\u00ad\u2010life of Lidocaine elimination from plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n=15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n=15). Menthols are largely eliminated as glucuronides. In an experiment, 79% of a 1g (Quick, 1928) and 78% of a 10-\u00ad\u201020mg (Atzl et al., 1972) oral dose of Menthol was eliminated as the glucuronic acid conjugate within 6 h after administration to volunteers. Of a dose of 47 mg/kg bw [3-\u00ad\u20103H]-\u00ad\u2010(-\u00ad\u2010)-\u00ad\u2010Menthol, 82% was eliminated in the urine 17 hours after administration. Smaller amounts were distributed in the feces and ileum; only 1% of the activity remained in the liver (Clegg et al., 1982). table1 fig1 mentholpath"], "manufacturer_name": ["Advanced Rx Pharmacy of Tennessee, LLC"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE", "MENTHOL"], "effective_time": "20240510", "product_ndc": ["80425-0385"], "brand_name": ["LIDOTHOL"]}

This offers long lasting relief for a variety of pain conditions. Drug"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is a common local anesthetic that relieves itching, burning, and pain. Topically, it blocks both initiation and conduction or nerve impulses by decreasing ionic flux through the neuronal membrane. Since it penetrates the skin, it creates an anesthetic effect by not just preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain out by stopping them before they begin. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Lidocaine- Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/ toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics, but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey, arterial blood levels of 18-21 g/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity. Excretion: Lidocaine- Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15)."], "manufacturer_name": ["PureTek Corporation"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240514", "product_ndc": ["59088-304"], "brand_name": ["Lidotral Two Percent"]}

The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys.

Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies performed with Mometasone Furoate Ointment indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids. In a study evaluating the effects of Mometasone Furoate Ointment on the HPA axis, 15 grams were applied twice daily for 7 days to 6 adult subjects with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. The ointment was applied without occlusion to at least 30% of the body surface. The results showed that the drug caused a slight lowering of adrenal corticosteroid secretion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Sixty-three pediatric subjects ages 6 to 23 months, with atopic dermatitis, were enrolled in an open-label HPA axis safety study. Mometasone Furoate Ointment was applied once daily for approximately 3 weeks over a mean body surface area of 39% (range 15% to 99%). In approximately 27% of subjects who showed normal adrenal function by Cortrosyn test before starting treatment, adrenal suppression was observed at the end of treatment with Mometasone Furoate Ointment. The criteria for suppression were: basal cortisol level of 5 mcg/dL, 30-minute post-stimulation level of 18 mcg/dL, or an increase of <7 mcg/dL. Follow-up testing 2 to 4 weeks after stopping treatment, available for 8 of the subjects, demonstrated suppressed HPA axis function in 3 subjects, using these same criteria [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Studies in humans indicate that approximately 0.7% of the applied dose of Mometasone Furoate Ointment enters the circulation after 8 hours of contact on normal skin without occlusion.

Chemically, clotrimazole is 1\u2013(o-chloro-\u03b1,\u03b1-diphenylbenzyl) imidazole, with the empirical formula C 22 H 17 CLN 2 , a molecular weight of 344.84, and the following structural formula: Clotrimazole is an odorless, white crystalline powder, insoluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Betamethasone dipropionate has 9-fluoro-11\u03b2,17,21-trihydroxy-16\u03b2-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 17,21-dipropionate, with the empirical formula C 28 H 37 FO 7 , a molecular weight of 504.59, and the following structural formula: Betamethasone dipropionate is a white to creamy-white, odorless crystalline powder, insoluble in water.

Chemical Structure Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Clotrimazole is an azole antifungal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) ] . Betamethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action for the treatment of tinea pedis, tinea cruris and tinea corporis is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstrictor Assay : Studies performed with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream indicate that these topical combination antifungal/corticosteroids may have vasoconstrictor potencies in a range that is comparable to high-potency topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Skin penetration and systemic absorption of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate following topical application of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream has not been studied. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Once absorbed through the skin, the pharmacokinetics of topical corticosteroids are similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action : Clotrimazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits 14-\u03b1-demethylation of lanosterol in fungi by binding to one of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes. This leads to the accumulation of 14-\u03b1-methylsterols and reduced concentrations of ergosterol, a sterol essential for a normal fungal cytoplasmic membrane. The methylsterols may affect the electron transport system, thereby inhibiting growth of fungi. Activity In Vitro and In Vivo : Clotrimazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following dermatophytes, both in vitro and in clinical infections, Epidermophyton floccosum , Trichophyton mentagrophytes , and Trichophyton rubrum [see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Drug Resistance : Strains of dermatophytes having a natural resistance to clotrimazole have not been reported. Resistance to azoles, including clotrimazole, has been reported in some Candida species. No single-step or multiple-step resistance to clotrimazole has developed during successive passages of Trichophyton mentagrophytes ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Preferred Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "substance_name": ["BETAMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE", "CLOTRIMAZOLE"], "effective_time": "20250307", "product_ndc": ["68788-8419"], "brand_name": ["Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate"]}

Lidocaine is present in a 4% concentration (w/w). It is chemically designated as 2-\u00ad\u2010(diethylamino)-\u00ad\u2010N-\u00ad\u2010(2,6-\u00ad\u2010 dimethylphenyl) acetamide and has an empirical formula of C14H22N2O. The molecular weight of Lidocaine is 234.34 g/mol. Menthol is present in a 1% concentration (w/w). The chemical name is (1R,2S,5R)-\u00ad\u20102-\u00ad\u2010isopropyl-\u00ad\u20105-\u00ad\u2010methylcyclohexanol. The empirical formula for Menthol is C10H20O with a molecular weight of 156.27 g/mol. Lidothol (Lidocaine 4% / Menthol 1% Patch) consists of an adhesive hydrogel containing Lidocaine 4% and Menthol 1%, applied to flexible woven polyester backing and protected by a plastic film. The protective film is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 12cm x 8cm. Lidocaine is chemically designated as 2-\u00ad\u2010(diethylamino)-\u00ad\u2010N-\u00ad\u2010(2,6-\u00ad\u2010dimethylphenyl), has an octanol: water partition ration of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: [lidocaine] Menthol is chemically designated as 2-\u00ad\u2010Isopropyl-\u00ad\u20105-\u00ad\u2010methylcyclohexanol.

It has a melting point between 31\u00b0C to 36\u00b0 C. Menthol has the following structure: [menthol] Each adhesive patch contains 76.5mg of Lidocaine and 85mg of Menthol. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, glycerol, methylparaben, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, sodium polyacrylate, tartaric acid, water"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["Lidocaine is a topical anesthetic and stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities. It also acts as a weak kappa (\u0138) opioid receptor agonist. Menthol chemically triggers the cold-\u00ad\u2010sensitive TRPM-\u00ad\u20108 receptors in the skin, which are responsible for the well-\u00ad\u2010documented cooling sensation that occurs when applied to the skin. Menthol\u2019s analgesic properties are not fully understood; however, they are mediated through a selective activation of \u0138-\u00ad\u2010opioid receptors. Menthol also blocks voltage-\u00ad\u2010sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue. Pharmacodynamics Menthol works by targeting the k-\u00ad\u2010opiod receptor on the TRPM8 neuron. The TRPM8 neuron is normally activated at temperatures between (8\u00b0 -\u00ad\u2010 28\u00b0 C). Menthol causes the neuron to fire at temperatures above normal activation, which triggers the characteristic cooling sensation. Also because of Menthol's specific targeting of the k-\u00ad\u2010opioid receptor, it is endowed with analgesic properties. Lidocaine is an amide-\u00ad\u2010type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of Lidocaine into intact skin after application of patch is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: The amount of Lidocaine and Menthol systemically absorbed is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three Lidocaine 5% patches were applied over an area of 420 cm2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for a determination of Lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in table 1. [table1] Repeated application of three days indicated that the Lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1.When Lidocaine 5% patch is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of Lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of Lidocaine is about 0.13 \u00b5g/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Figure 1 Mean Lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three Lidocaine 5% patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). [fig1] Distribution: When Lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of Lidocaine Patch 5%, Lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-\u00ad\u20101-\u00ad\u2010acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 \u00b5g/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of Lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism: It is not known if Lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including menoethylglycinexylidie (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of Lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-\u00ad\u2010xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of Lidocaine Patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11% to 36% and from 5% to 11% of Lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Humans rapidly metabolize Menthols primarily in the liver by the microsomes, using the enzyme CYP2A6. Cytochrome P450-\u00ad\u2010mediated oxidation occurs in humans, yielding various alcohol and hydroxy acid derivatives. These are eliminated in the urine unchanged or conjugated with glucuronic acid. [mentholpath] Excretion: Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of Lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-\u00ad\u2010life of Lidocaine elimination from plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n=15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n=15). Menthols are largely eliminated as glucuronides. In an experiment, 79% of a 1g (Quick, 1928) and 78% of a 10-\u00ad\u201020mg (Atzl et al., 1972) oral dose of Menthol was eliminated as the glucuronic acid conjugate within 6 h after administration to volunteers. Of a dose of 47 mg/kg bw [3-\u00ad\u20103H]-\u00ad\u2010(-\u00ad\u2010)-\u00ad\u2010Menthol, 82% was eliminated in the urine 17 hours after administration. Smaller amounts were distributed in the feces and ileum; only 1% of the activity remained in the liver (Clegg et al., 1982)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Direct_Rx"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE", "MENTHOL"], "effective_time": "20240528", "product_ndc": ["72189-553"], "brand_name": ["Lidothol Patch"]}

There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics - The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systematically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."], "manufacturer_name": ["Direct_Rx"], "substance_name": ["HYDROCORTISONE"], "effective_time": "20240530", "product_ndc": ["72189-554"], "brand_name": ["Hydrocortisone Cream"]}

It also contains the following inactive ingredients: dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, disodium edetate, gelatin, glycerin, kaolin, methylparaben, polyvinyl alcohol, propylparaben, propylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, partially neutralized sodium polyacrylate, D-sorbitol, tartaric acid, and urea."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from lidocaine patch 5% Normal volunteers (n = 15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11% to 36% and from 5% to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bryant Ranch Prepack"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE"], "effective_time": "20240403", "product_ndc": ["72162-2085"], "brand_name": ["Lidocaine"]}

Hydrocortisone acetate provides relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses. Pharmacokinetics: Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration, and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18-21 g/mL have been shown to be the threshold for convulsive activity. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. Once absorbed through skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.

This offers long lasting relief for a variety of pain conditions. Drug"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is a common local anesthetic that relieves itching, burning, and pain. Topically, it blocks both initiation and conduction or nerve impulses by decreasing ionic flux through the neuronal membrane. Since it penetrates the skin, it creates an anesthetic effect by not just preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain out by stopping them before they begin. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Lidocaine- Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/ toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics, but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey, arterial blood levels of 18-21 g/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity. Excretion: Lidocaine- Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15)."], "manufacturer_name": ["PureTek Corporation"], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240604", "product_ndc": ["59088-350"], "brand_name": ["Lidotral Five Percent"]}

The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.

There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.

The drug substance, anacaulase-bcdb, is composed mainly (80% to 95% w/w) of the proteins: stem bromelain, ananain, jacalin-like lectin, bromelain inhibitors, and phytocystatin inhibitor; and saccharides, as both free monosaccharides and the N-linked glycan of stem bromelain, and small molecule metabolites. The drug substance includes inactive buffer components containing acetic acid, ammonium sulfate, and Water for Injection. Each gram of lyophilized powder contains 0.97 grams of anacaulase-bcdb. NEXOBRID (anacaulase-bcdb) for topical gel is a botanical drug product supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, lyophilized powder in a single-dose glass vial that must be mixed in a gel vehicle supplied in a single-dose glass jar prior to application. Mixture of either 2 grams of lyophilized powder (containing 1.94 grams of anacaulase-bcdb) or 5 grams of lyophilized powder (containing 4.85 grams of anacaulase-bcdb) in 20 grams or 50 grams of gel vehicle, respectively, provides an 8.8% w/w, yellowish white to light brown opaque gel for topical use.

The specific components responsible for this effect have not been identified. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of NEXOBRID are unknown. Cardiac Electrophysiology At the approved recommended dose, NEXOBRID did not prolong the QT interval in humans to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For adults and pediatric subjects 4 years of age and older, NEXOBRID applied to deep partial and full thickness burn wounds is absorbed, with median serum T max of 4 hours (during the treatment application). Systemic exposure (i.e., AUC) of bromelain, a component of anacaulase-bcdb is correlated with the size of the treated area and NEXOBRID dose, but not the depth of the burn wound. The systemic exposure in pediatric subjects was comparable to adults. In adult subjects, C max and the dose\u2011normalized C max values after the first and second application (mean dosing interval of 17 hours) are comparable and only slight accumulation (less than 2-fold difference) is seen in AUC 0-4 and AUC 0-4 dose\u2011normalized levels after the second application, compared to the first application. Elimination A majority of adults and pediatric subjects had no quantifiable serum concentrations after 72 hours.

However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours has not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.

It is designed to deliver sustained circulating concentrations of estradiol when applied once daily to the skin. The gel is applied to a small area (200 cm 2 ) of the thigh in a thin layer. Estradiol gel 0.1% is available in five doses of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 1.25 g for topical application (corresponding to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 1.25 mg estradiol, respectively). The active component of the topical gel is estradiol. Estradiol is a white crystalline powder, chemically described as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17\u00df-diol. It has an empirical formula of C 18 H 24 O 2 and molecular weight of 272.39.

Divigel Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman\u2019s therapeutic response to estradiol gel 0.1% nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Estradiol diffuses across intact skin and into the systemic circulation by a passive absorption process, with diffusion across the stratum corneum being the rate-limiting factor. In a 14-day, Phase 1, multiple-dose study, estradiol gel 0.1% demonstrated linear and approximately dose-proportional estradiol pharmacokinetics at steady state for both AUC 0-24 and C max following once daily dosing to the skin of either the right or left upper thigh (Table 2). Steady-state serum concentration of estradiol are achieved by day 12 following daily application of estradiol gel 0.1% to the skin of the upper thigh. The mean (SD) serum estradiol levels following once daily dosing at day 14 are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Mean (SD) Serum Estradiol Concentrations (Values Uncorrected for Baseline) on Day 14 Following Multiple Daily Doses of Estradiol Gel 0.1% The effect of sunscreens and other topical lotions on the systemic exposure of estradiol gel 0.1% has not been evaluated. Studies conducted using topical estrogen gel approved products have shown that sunscreens have the potential for changing the systemic exposure of topically applied estrogen gels. Distribution The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin. Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens. Although the clinical significance has not been determined, estradiol from estradiol gel 0.1% does not undergo first pass metabolism and provides estradiol to estrone ratios at steady state in the range of 0.42 to 0.65. Excretion Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The apparent terminal half-life for estradiol was about 10 hours following administration of estradiol gel 0.1%. Potential for Estradiol Transfer The effect of estradiol transfer was evaluated in healthy postmenopausal women who topically applied 1.0 gram of estradiol gel 0.1% (single dose) on one thigh. One and 8 hours after gel application, they engaged in direct thigh-to-arm contact with a partner for 15 minutes. While some elevation of estradiol levels over baseline was seen in the male subjects, the degree of transferability in this study was inconclusive. Effects of Washing The effect of application site washing on skin surface levels and serum concentrations of estradiol was determined in 16 healthy postmenopausal women after application of 1.0 gram of estradiol gel 0.1% to a 200 cm 2 area on the thigh. Washing the application site with soap and water 1 hour after application removed all detectable amounts of estradiol from the surface of the skin, and resulted in a 30 to 38 percent decrease in the mean total 24-hour exposure to estradiol.

Lidocaine and prilocaine are amide-type local anesthetic agents. Both lidocaine and prilocaine stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. The onset, depth and duration of dermal analgesia on intact skin provided by Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream depends primarily on the duration of application. To provide sufficient analgesia for clinical procedures such as intravenous catheter placement and venipuncture, Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream should be applied under an occlusive dressing for at least 1 hour. To provide dermal analgesia for clinical procedures such as split skin graft harvesting, Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream should be applied under occlusive dressing for at least 2 hours. Satisfactory dermal analgesia is achieved 1 hour after application, reaches maximum at 2 to 3 hours, and persists for 1 to 2 hours after removal. Absorption from the genital mucosa is more rapid and onset time is shorter (5 to 10 minutes) than after application to intact skin. After a 5 to 10 minute application of Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream to female genital mucosa, the average duration of effective analgesia to an argon laser stimulus (which produced a sharp, pricking pain) was 15 to 20 minutes (individual variations in the range of 5 to 45 minutes). Dermal application of Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream, may cause a transient, local blanching followed by a transient, local redness or erythema. Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics: Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream is a eutectic mixture of lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5% formulated as an oil in water emulsion. In this eutectic mixture, both anesthetics are liquid at room temperature (see DESCRIPTION) and the penetration and subsequent systemic absorption of both prilocaine and lidocaine are enhanced over that which would be seen if each component in crystalline form was applied separately as a 2.5% topical cream. Absorption: The amount of lidocaine and prilocaine systemically absorbed from Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream is directly related to both the duration of application and to the area over which it is applied. In two pharmacokinetic studies, 60 g of Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream (1.5 g lidocaine and 1.5 g prilocaine) was applied to 400 cm2 of intact skin on the lateral thigh and then covered by an occlusive dressing. The subjects were then randomized such that one-half of the subjects had the occlusive dressing and residual cream removed after 3 hours, while the remainder left the dressing in place for 24 hours. The results from these studies are summarized below. TABLE 1 Absorption of Lidocaine and Prilocaine from Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream: Normal Volunteers (N=16) Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream (g) Area (cm 2 ) Time on (hrs) Drug Content (mg) Absorbed (mg) C max (\u03bcg/mL) T max (hr) 60 400 3 lidocaine 1500 54 0.12 4 prilocaine 1500 92 0.07 4 60 400 24* lidocaine 1500 243 0.28 10 prilocaine 1500 503 0.14 10 *Maximum recommended duration of exposure is 4 hours. When 60 g of Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream was applied over 400 cm2 for 24 hours, peak blood levels of lidocaine are approximately 1/20 the systemic toxic level. Likewise, the maximum prilocaine level is about 1/36 the toxic level. In a pharmacokinetic study, Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream was applied to penile skin in 20 adult male patients in doses ranging from 0.5 g to 3.3 g for 15 minutes. Plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine following Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream application in this study were consistently low (2.5 to 16 ng/mL for lidocaine and 2.5 to 7 ng/mL for prilocaine). The application of Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream to broken or inflamed skin, or to 2000 cm2 or more of skin where more of both anesthetics are absorbed, could result in higher plasma levels that could, in susceptible individuals, produce a systemic pharmacologic response. The absorption of Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream applied to genital mucous membranes was studied in two open-label clinical trials. Twenty-nine patients received 10 g of Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream applied for 10 to 60 minutes in the vaginal fornices. Plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine following Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream application in these studies ranged from 148 to 641 ng/mL for lidocaine and 40 to 346 ng/mL for prilocaine and time to reach maximum concentration (tmax) ranged from 21 to 125 minutes for lidocaine and from 21 to 95 minutes for prilocaine. These levels are well below the concentrations anticipated to give rise to systemic toxicity (approximately 5000 ng/mL for lidocaine and prilocaine). Distribution: When each drug is administered intravenously, the steady-state volume of distribution is 1.1 to 2.1 L/kg (mean 1.5, \u00b10.3 SD, n=13) for lidocaine and is 0.7 to 4.4 L/kg (mean 2.6, \u00b11.3 SD, n=13) for prilocaine. The larger distribution volume for prilocaine produces the lower plasma concentrations of prilocaine observed when equal amounts of prilocaine and lidocaine are administered. At concentrations produced by application of Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 \u03bcg/mL of free base) the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Prilocaine is 55% bound to plasma proteins. Both lidocaine and prilocaine cross the placental and blood brain barrier, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism: It is not known if lidocaine or prilocaine are metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. The metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Prilocaine is metabolized in both the liver and kidneys by amidases to various metabolites including ortho-toluidine and N-n-propylalanine. It is not metabolized by plasma esterases. The ortho-toluidine metabolite has been shown to be carcinogenic in several animal models (see Carcinogenesis subsection of PRECAUTIONS). In addition, ortho-toluidine can produce methemoglobinemia following systemic doses of prilocaine approximating 8 mg/kg (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Very young patients, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies and patients taking oxidizing drugs such as antimalarials and sulfonamides are more susceptible to methemoglobinemia (see Methemoglobinemia subsection of WARNINGS). Elimination: The terminal elimination half-life of lidocaine from the plasma following IV administration is approximately 65 to 150 minutes (mean 110, \u00b124 SD, n=13). More than 98% of an absorbed dose of lidocaine can be recovered in the urine as metabolites or parent drug. The systemic clearance is 10 to 20 mL/min/kg (mean 13, \u00b13 SD, n=13). The elimination half-life of prilocaine is approximately 10 to 150 minutes (mean 70,\u00b148 SD, n=13). The systemic clearance is 18 to 64 mL/min/kg (mean 38, \u00b115 SD, n=13). During intravenous studies, the elimination half-life of lidocaine was statistically significantly longer in elderly patients (2.5 hours) than in younger patients (1.5 hours). No studies are available on the intravenous pharmacokinetics of prilocaine in elderly patients. Pediatrics: Some pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available in infants (1 month to <2 years old) and children (2 to <12 years old).One PK study was conducted in 9 full-term neonates (mean age: 7 days and mean gestational age: 38.8 weeks).The study results show that neonates had comparable plasma lidocaine and prilocaine concentrations and blood methemoglobin concentrations as those found in previous pediatric PK studies and clinical trials. There was a tendency towards an increase in methemoglobin formation. However, due to assay limitations and very little amount of blood that could be collected from neonates, large variations in the above reported concentrations were found. Special Populations: No specific PK studies were conducted. The half-life may be increased in cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.

Chemical Structure Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ciclopirox is a hydroxypyridone antifungal agent that acts by chelation of polyvalent cations (Fe 3+ or Al 3+ ), resulting in the inhibition of the metal-dependent enzymes that are responsible for the degradation of peroxides within the fungal cell. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies in men with tagged ciclopirox solution in polyethylene glycol 400 showed an average of 1.3% absorption of the dose when it was applied topically to 750 cm 2 on the back followed by occlusion for 6 hours. The biological half-life was 1.7 hours and excretion occurred via the kidney. Two days after application only 0.01% of the dose applied could be found in the urine. Fecal excretion was negligible. Penetration studies in human cadaverous skin from the back, with ciclopirox olamine cream with tagged ciclopirox showed the presence of 0.8 to 1.6% of the dose in the stratum corneum 1.5 to 6 hours after application. The levels in the dermis were still 10 to 15 times above the minimum inhibitory concentrations. Autoradiographic studies with human cadaverous skin showed that ciclopirox penetrates into the hair and through the epidermis and hair follicles into the sebaceous glands and dermis, while a portion of the drug remains in the stratum corneum. Draize Human Sensitization Assay, 21-Day Cumulative Irritancy study, Phototoxicity study, and Photo-Draize study conducted in a total of 142 healthy male subjects showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity, and no photo-contact sensitization due to ciclopirox olamine cream."], "manufacturer_name": ["Padagis Israel Pharmaceuticals Ltd"], "substance_name": ["CICLOPIROX OLAMINE"], "effective_time": "20250116", "product_ndc": ["45802-138"], "brand_name": ["Ciclopirox olamine"]}
