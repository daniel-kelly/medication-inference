Each gram of TAZORAC Cream, 0.05% and 0.1% contains 0.5 and 1 mg of tazarotene, respectively in a white cream base. Tazarotene is a member of the acetylenic class of retinoids. Chemically, tazarotene is ethyl 6-[(4,4-dimethylthiochroman-6-yl)ethynyl]nicotinate. The compound has an empirical formula of C 21 H 21 NO 2 S and molecular weight of 351.46. The structural formula is shown below: TAZORAC Cream contains the following inactive ingredients: benzyl alcohol 1%; carbomer 1342; carbomer homopolymer type B; edetate disodium; medium chain triglycerides; mineral oil; purified water; sodium hydroxide; sodium thiosulfate; and sorbitan monooleate. Tazortene Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1 , RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3, but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours, following topical application of tazarotene to normal, acne or psoriatic skin. In a multiple dose trial with a once daily dose for 14 consecutive days in 9 psoriatic subjects (male=5; female=4), measured doses of TAZORAC Cream, 0.1% were applied by medical staff to involved skin without occlusion (5 to 35% of total body surface area: mean \u00b1 SD: 14 \u00b1 11%). The C max of tazarotenic acid was 2.31 \u00b1 2.78 ng/mL occurring 8 hours after the final dose, and the AUC 0-24h was 31.2 \u00b1 35.2 ng\u2022hr/mL on day 15 in the five subjects who were administered clinical doses of 2 mg cream/cm 2 . During clinical trials with TAZORAC Cream, 0.05% or 0.1% treatment for plaque psoriasis, three out of 139 subjects with their systemic exposure monitored had detectable plasma tazarotene concentrations, with the highest value at 0.09 ng/mL. Tazarotenic acid was detected in 78 out of 139 subjects (LLOQ = 0.05 ng/mL). Three subjects using tazarotene cream 0.1% had plasma tazarotenic acid concentrations greater than 1 ng/mL. The highest value was 2.4 ng/mL. However, because of the variations in the time of blood sampling, the area of psoriasis involvement, and the dose of tazarotene applied, actual maximal plasma levels are unknown. TAZORAC Cream 0.1% was applied once daily to either the face (N=8) or to 15% of body surface area (N=10) of female subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris. The mean C max and AUC values of tazarotenic acid peaked at day 15 for both dosing groups during a 29 day treatment period. Mean C max and AUC 0-24h values of tazarotenic acid from subjects in the 15% body surface area dosing group were more than 10 times higher than those from subjects in the face-only dosing group. The single highest C max throughout the trial period was 1.91 ng/mL on day 15 in the exaggerated dosing group. In the face-only group, the mean \u00b1 SD values of C max and AUC 0-24h of tazarotenic acid on day 15 were 0.10 \u00b1 0.06 ng/mL and 1.54 \u00b1 1.01 ng\u2219hr/mL, respectively, whereas in the 15% body surface area dosing group, the mean \u00b1 SD values of C max and AUC 0-24h of tazarotenic acid on day 15 were 1.20 \u00b1 0.41 ng/mL and 17.01 \u00b1 6.15 ng \u2219 hr/mL, respectively. The steady state pharmacokinetics of tazarotenic acid had been reached by day 8 in the face-only and by day 15 in the 15% body surface area dosing groups. In a Phase 3 clinical trial, TAZORAC Cream, 0.1% was applied once daily for 12 weeks to each of 48 subjects (22 females and 26 males) with facial acne vulgaris. The mean \u00b1 SD values of plasma tazarotenic acid at weeks 4 and 8 were 0.078 \u00b1 0.073 ng/mL (N=47) and 0.052 \u00b1 0.037 ng/mL (N=42), respectively. The highest observed individual plasma tazarotenic acid concentration was 0.41 ng/mL at week 4 from a female subject.

The release liner is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 10 cm x 14 cm. Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 2\u2011(diethylamino)\u2011N\u2011(2,6\u2011 dimethylphenyl), has an octanol: water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, disodium edetate, gelatin, glycerin, kaolin, methylparaben, polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl alcohol, propylene glycol, propylparaben, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium polyacrylate, D-sorbitol, tartaric acid, and urea. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of LIDOCAINE PATCH 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from LIDOCAINE PATCH 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three LIDOCAINE PATCH 5% patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from LIDOCAINE PATCH 5% Normal volunteers (n = 15, 12-hour wearing time) LIDOCAINE PATCH 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When LIDOCAINE PATCH 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three LIDOCAINE PATCH 5% patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Figure 1 Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n=15). At concentrations produced by application of LIDOCAINE PATCH 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha\u20111\u2011acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2, 6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of LIDOCAINE PATCH 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Golden State Medical Supply, Inc."], "substance_name": ["LIDOCAINE"], "effective_time": "20250509", "product_ndc": ["51407-827"], "brand_name": ["Lidocaine"]}

The extract contains the water extractables of the pollen, 0.25% sodium chloride, 0.125% sodium bicarbonate, 0.5% phenol and 50% glycerol by volume. Extract of mixed short-giant ragweed has the same appearance as short ragweed pollen extract and contains the same chemical ingredients. It is prepared from equal gram weights of the pollens of Ambrosia elatior and Ambrosia trifida . STANDARDIZATION - The potency of ragweed pollen extract is based on antigen E, a protein component which is believed to be the most important allergen of short ragweed pollen. Extracts of short ragweed pollen sold in the U.S. must have a minimum antigen E content of 67.5 units per ml for a 1:20 w/v concentrate. Extracts of mixed short-giant ragweed must have a minimum antigen E content of 33.75 units/ml for a 1:20 w/v concentrate. The importance of antigen E in ragweed allergy is based on the following observations: In vitro studies with antigen E have shown that it is capable of causing histamine release from peripheral leukocytes of ragweed sensitive persons 1 . The antigen E content of short ragweed pollen extract has been found to correlate with extract potency when measured by skin test response in persons allergic to short ragweed pollen 2 . Immunotherapy with antigen E has been shown to be comparably effective to whole short ragweed pollen extract in reducing symptoms related to ragweed pollen exposure 3 . The weight by volume value shown on the label is a measurement of extract concentration, rather than extract potency. Weight by volume designations may be used to identify dilutions of extract for skin testing and immunotherapy, and are useful from a practical standpoint in identifying the relative strength of a given extract. However, studies have shown that the antigen E content varies in extracts with the same weight by volume concentration 4 . EXPIRATION DATING - Expiration dating is based on the antigen E content of the extract. Extracts containing 50% glycerol by volume have longer dating periods due to the protective effects of glycerol on antigen E 5, 6 . The expiration period of aqueous concentrate and saline dilutions of glycerinated concentrate is approximately one-half that of glycerinated extract containing comparable antigen E content.
