Bivalirudin is a synthetic, 20 amino acid peptide, with the chemical name of D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl-L-prolyl-glycyl-glycyl-glycyl-glycyl-L-asparagyl-glycyl-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-glutamyl-L-glutamyl-L-isoleucyl-L-prolyl-L-glutamyl-L-glutamyl-L-tyrosyl-L-leucine. The active pharmaceutical ingredient is in the form of bivalirudin trifluoroacetate as a white to off-white powder. The chemical name for bivalirudin trifluoroacetate is D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl-L-prolyl-glycyl-glycyl-glycyl-glycyl-L-asparagyl-glycyl-L-aspartyl-Lphenylalanyl-L-glutamyl-L-glutamyl-L-isoleucyl-L-prolyl-L-glutamyl-L-glutamyl-L-tyrosyl-L-leucine trifluoroacetate (Figure 1). The molecular weight of bivalirudin is 2180 daltons (anhydrous free base peptide). Figure 1: Structure formula for bivalirudin trifluoroacetate Bivalirudin for injection is supplied as a sterile white lyophilized cake, in single-dose vials. Each vial contains 250 mg bivalirudin, equivalent to an average of 275 mg of bivalirudin trifluoroacetate*, 125 mg mannitol, and sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH to 5 to 6 (equivalent of approximately 12.5 mg sodium). When reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, the product yields a clear to opalescent, colorless to pale yellow solution, pH 5 to 6. *The range of bivalirudin trifluoroacetate is 270 mg to 280 mg based on a range of trifluoroacetic acid composition of 1.7 to 2.6 equivalents."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bivalirudin directly inhibits thrombin by specifically binding both to the catalytic site and to the anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin. Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release. The binding of bivalirudin to thrombin is reversible as thrombin slowly cleaves the bivalirudin-Arg 3 -Pro 4 bond, resulting in recovery of thrombin active site functions. In in vitro studies, bivalirudin inhibited both soluble (free) and clot-bound thrombin, was not neutralized by products of the platelet release reaction, and prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin time (PT) of normal human plasma in a concentration-dependent manner. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy volunteers and patients (with \u226570% vessel occlusion undergoing routine PTCA), bivalirudin exhibited dose- and concentration-dependent anticoagulant activity as evidenced by prolongation of the ACT, aPTT, PT, and TT. Intravenous administration of bivalirudin producesan immediate anticoagulant effect. Coagulation times return to baseline approximately 1 hourfollowing cessation of bivalirudin administration. Bivalirudin for injection also increase INR. Therefore INR measurements made in bivalirudin for injection treated patients may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. In 291 patients with \u226570% vessel occlusion undergoing routine PTCA, a positive correlation was observed between the dose of bivalirudin and the proportion of patients achieving ACT values of 300 sec or 350 sec. At a bivalirudin dose of 1 mg/kg IV bolus plus 2.5 mg/kg/h IV infusion for 4 hours, followed by 0.2 mg/kg/h, all patients reached maximal ACT values >300 sec. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Bivalirudin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics following IV administration to patients undergoing PTCA. In these patients, a mean steady state bivalirudin concentration of 12.3 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL is a chieved following an IV bolus of 1 mg/kg and a 4-hour 2.5 mg/kg/h IV infusion. Distribution Bivalirudin does not bind to plasma proteins (other than thrombin) or to red blood cells. Elimination Bivalirudin has a half-life of 25 minutes in PTCA patients with normal renal function. The totalbody clearance of bivalirudin in PTCA patients with normal renal function is 3.4 mL/min/kg. Metabolism Bivalirudin is metabolized by proteolytic cleavage. Excretion Bivalirudin undergoes glomerular filtration. Tubular secretion and tubular reabsorption are also implicated in the excretion of bivalirudin, although the extent is unknown. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Total body clearance was similar for PTCA patients with normal renal function and with mildrenal impairment. Clearance was reduced by 21% in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment with a half-life of 34 and 57 minutes, respectively. In dialysis patients, clearance was reduced by 70%, with a half-life of 3.5 hours. Approximately25% bivalirudin is cleared by hemodialysis."], "manufacturer_name": ["Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited"], "substance_name": ["BIVALIRUDIN"], "effective_time": "20190716", "product_ndc": ["55111-652"], "brand_name": ["Bivalirudin"]}
