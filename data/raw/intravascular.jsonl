The chemical formula is 5,5\u00b4-[(2-hydroxy-1,3-propanediyl) bis(acetylimino)] bis[N,N\u00b4-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodo-\u00ad1,3-benzenedicarboxamide] with a molecular weight of 1,550.18 (iodine content 49.1%). Iodixanol (C 35 H 44 I 6 N 6 O 15 ) has the following structural formula: Iodixanol injection, USP is available in two strengths: Iodixanol Injection, USP, 270 mg Iodine/mL (550 mg Iodixanol/mL), 0.074 mg calcium chloride dihydrate, 1.87 mg sodium chloride, 1.2 mg tromethamine, and 0.1 mg edetate calcium disodium. Iodixanol Injection, USP, 320 mg Iodine/mL (652 mg Iodixanol/mL), 0.044 mg calcium chloride dihydrate, 1.11 mg sodium chloride, 1.2 mg tromethamine and 0.1 mg edetate calcium disodium. Sodium chloride and calcium chloride have been added, resulting in an isotonic solution for injection providing for both concentrations a sodium/calcium ratio equivalent to blood. The pH is adjusted to 7.4 with hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide to achieve a range between pH 6.8 and 7.7 at 22\u00b0C.

In imaging of the body, iodinated contrast agents diffuse from the vascular into the extravascular space. In a normal brain with an intact blood-brain barrier, contrast does not diffuse into the extravascular space. In patients with a disrupted blood- brain barrier, contrast agent accumulates in the interstitial space in the region of disruption. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following administration of iodixanol, the degree of enhancement is directly related to the iodine content in an administered dose. Peak iodine plasma levels occur immediately following rapid injection. The time to maximum contrast enhancement can vary, depending on the organ, from the time that peak blood iodine concentrations are reached to one hour after intravenous bolus administration. When a delay between peak blood iodine concentrations and peak contrast is present, it suggests that radiographic contrast enhancement is at least in part dependent on the accumulation of iodine-containing medium within the lesion and outside the blood pool. For angiography, contrast enhancement is greatest immediately (15 seconds to 120 seconds) after rapid injection. Iodinated contrast agents may be visualized in the renal parenchyma within 30 to 60 seconds following rapid intravenous injection. Opacification of the calyces and pelves in patients with normal renal function becomes apparent within 1 to 3 minutes, with optimum contrast occurring within 5 to 15 minutes. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution In an in vitro human plasma study, iodixanol did not bind to protein. The volume of distribution in adults was 0.26 L/kg body weight, consistent with distribution to extracellular space. Elimination In 40 healthy, young male volunteers receiving a single intravenous administration of iodixanol in doses of 0.3 gram Iodine/kg to 1.2 gram Iodine/kg body weight, the elimination half-life was 2.1 hr. (\u00b1 0.1). Renal clearance was 110 \u00b1 14 mL/min, equivalent to glomerular filtration (108 mL/min). These values were independent of the dose administered. Metabolism Iodixanol does not undergo metabolism. Excretion In adults, approximately 97% of the injected dose of iodixanol is excreted unchanged in urine within 24 hours, with less than 2% excreted in feces within five days post-injection. Specific Populations Pediatric: Forty pediatric patients \u226412 years old, with renal function that is normal for their age, received multiple intra-arterial administrations of iodixanol in doses of 0.32 gram Iodine/kg to 3.2 gram Iodine/kg body weight. The elimination half-lives for these patients are shown in Table 5. Dose adjustments to account for differences in elimination half-life in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age have not been studied.

In a study of 16 adult patients who were scheduled for renal transplant, the mean creatinine clearance was 13.6 \u00b1 4.7 mL/min). In these patients, plasma half-life was 23 hours (t 1/2 for typical patients = 2.1 hours). Contrast enhancement time in kidneys increased from 6 hours to at least 24 hours. Dose adjustments in patients with renal impairment have not been studied. In patients with normal blood brain barriers and severe renal impairment, iodinated contrast agents have been associated with blood-brain barrier disruption and accumulation of contrast in the brain. Iodixanol has been shown to be dialyzable. In an in vitro hemodialysis study, after 4 hours of dialysis with a cellulose membrane, approximately 36% of iodixanol was removed from the plasma. After 4 hours of dialysis with polysulfone membranes, approximately 49% of iodixanol was removed."], "manufacturer_name": ["FRESENIUS KABI USA, LLC"], "substance_name": ["IODIXANOL"], "effective_time": "20230721", "product_ndc": ["65219-381", "65219-383"], "brand_name": ["Iodixanol"]}

Conray may also be used for enhancement of computed tomographic scans performed for detection and evaluation of lesions in the liver, pancreas, kidneys, abdominal aorta, mediastinum, abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal space. Continuous or multiple scans separated by intervals of 1 to 3 seconds during the first 30 to 90 seconds post-injection of the contrast medium (dynamic CT scanning) may provide enhancement of diagnostic significance, and may be of benefit in establishing diagnoses of certain lesions in these sites with greater assurance than is possible with CT alone, and in supplying additional features of the lesions. In other cases, the contrast agent may allow visualization of lesions not seen with CT alone, or may help to define suspicious lesions seen with unenhanced CT (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Subsets of patients in whom delayed body CT scans might be helpful have not been identified. Inconsistent results have been reported and abnormal and normal tissues may be isodense during the time frame used for delayed CT scanning.

Conray contains 60% w/v iothalamate meglumine, which is 1-deoxy-1-(methylamino)-D-glucitol 5-acetamido-2,4,6 triiodo-N-methylisophthalamate (salt), and has the following structural formula: Each milliliter contains 600 mg of iothalamate meglumine, 0.09 mg edetate calcium disodium as a stabilizer and 0.125 mg of monobasic sodium phosphate as a buffer. The solution provides 28.2% (282 mg/mL) organically bound iodine. Conray has an osmolarity of approximately 1000 mOsmol per liter, an osmolality of approximately 1400 mOsmol per kilogram and is, therefore, hypertonic under conditions of use. The viscosity (cps) is approximately 6 at 25\u00b0C and 4 at 37\u00b0C. The pH is 6.5 to 7.7. Conray is a clear solution containing no undissolved solids.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following intravascular injection, Conray is rapidly transported through the circulatory system to the kidneys and is excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration. The pharmacokinetics of intravascularly administered radiopaque contrast media are usually best described by a two compartment model with a rapid alpha phase for drug distribution and a slower beta phase for drug elimination. In patients with normal renal function, the alpha and beta half-lives of Conray were approximately 10 and 90 minutes, respectively. Angiography may be performed following intravascular injection which will permit visualization until significant hemodilution occurs. Renal accumulation is sufficiently rapid that maximum radiographic density in the calyces and pelves occurs, in most instances, about 3 to 8 minutes after injection. In patients with impaired renal function, diagnostic opacification frequently is achieved only after prolonged periods. Injectable iodinated contrast agents are excreted either through the kidneys or through the liver. These two excretory pathways are not mutually exclusive, but the main route of excretion seems to be related to the affinity of the contrast medium for serum albumin. Iothalamate salts are poorly bound to serum albumin, and are excreted mainly through the kidneys. The liver and small intestine provide the major alternate route of excretion. In patients with severe renal impairment, the excretion of this contrast medium through the gallbladder and into the small intestine sharply increases. Iothalamate salts cross the placental barrier in humans and are excreted unchanged in human milk. The biliary system, pancreatic duct or joint spaces may be visualized by the direct injection of contrast medium into the region to be studied. CT Scanning of the Head When used for contrast enhancement in computed tomographic brain scanning, the degree of enhancement is directly related to the amount of iodine administered. Rapid injection of the entire dose yields peak blood iodine concentrations immediately following the injection, which fall rapidly over the next five to ten minutes. This can be accounted for by the dilution in the vascular and extracellular fluid compartments which causes an initial sharp fall in plasma concentration. Equilibration with the extracellular compartments is reached by about ten minutes; thereafter, the fall becomes exponential. Maximum contrast enhancement frequently occurs after peak blood iodine levels are reached. The delay in maximum contrast enhancement can range from five to forty minutes, depending on the peak iodine levels achieved and the cell type of the lesion. This lag suggests that the contrast enhancement of the image is at least in part dependent on the accumulation of iodine within the lesion and outside the blood pool. In brain scanning, the contrast medium (Conray) does not accumulate in normal brain tissue due to the presence of the \u201cblood brain barrier.\u201d The increase in x-ray absorption in the normal brain is due to the presence of the contrast agent within the blood pool. A break in the blood brain barrier, such as occurs in malignant tumors of the brain, allows accumulation of contrast medium within the interstitial tumor tissue; adjacent normal brain tissue does not contain the contrast medium. The image enhancement of non-tumoral lesions, such as arteriovenous malformations and aneurysms, is dependent on the iodine content of the circulating blood pool. When used for cranial computerized angiotomography, rapid bolus injection and/or infusion combined with rapid CT scanning will provide clear delineation of the cerebral vessels. CT Scanning of the Body 1 In non-neural tissues (during CT of the body), Conray diffuses rapidly from the vascular to the extra-vascular space. Increase in x-ray absorption is related to blood flow, concentration of the contrast medium and extraction of the contrast medium by interstitial tissue, since no barrier exists; contrast enhancement is thus due to the relative differences in extra-vascular diffusion between normal and abnormal tissue, a situation quite different than that in the brain. The pharmacokinetics of Conray in normal and abnormal tissues has been shown to be variable. Enhancement of CT with Conray may be of benefit in establishing diagnoses of certain lesions in some sites with greater assurance than is possible with unenhanced CT and in supplying additional features of the lesions. In other cases, the contrast medium may allow visualization of lesions not seen with CT alone or may help to define suspicious lesions seen with unenhanced CT. Contrast enhancement appears to be greatest within the 30 to 90 seconds after bolus administration of the contrast agent, and after intra-arterial, rather than intravenous, administration. Therefore, the use of a continuous scanning technique (a series of 2 to 3 second scans beginning at the injection - dynamic CT scanning) may improve enhancement and diagnostic assessment of tumors and other lesions, such as an abscess, occasionally revealing more extensive disease. A cyst, or similar non-vascularized lesion, may be distinguished from vascularized solid lesions by comparing enhanced and unenhanced scans; non-vascularized lesions show no change in CT number, whereas vascularized lesions would show an increase. The latter might be benign, malignant or normal, but it is unlikely that it would be a cyst, hematoma, or other non-vascularized lesion. Because unenhanced scanning may provide adequate information in the individual patient, the decision to employ contrast enhancement, which is associated with additional risk and increased exposure, should be based upon a careful evaluation of clinical, other radiological, and unenhanced CT findings."], "manufacturer_name": ["Liebel-Flarsheim Company LLC"], "substance_name": ["IOTHALAMATE MEGLUMINE"], "effective_time": "20230511", "product_ndc": ["0019-0953"], "brand_name": ["Conray"]}
