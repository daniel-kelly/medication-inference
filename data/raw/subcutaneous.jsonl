Structure of Azacitidine"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."], "manufacturer_name": ["Pilnova Pharma Inc"], "substance_name": ["AZACITIDINE"], "effective_time": "20241216", "product_ndc": ["83774-102"], "brand_name": ["AZACITIDINE"]}

Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to 18 healthy male subjects was 97% \u00b1 16% of that obtained following intravenous injection. After a single 6-mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males (age: 24 \u00b1 6 years, weight: 70 kg), the maximum serum concentration (C max ) of sumatriptan was (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 74 \u00b1 15 ng/mL and the time to peak concentration (T max ) was 12 minutes after injection (range: 5 to 20 minutes). In this trial, the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a C max of 61 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by manual injection versus 52 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by autoinjector techniques. The T max or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age: 33 years, mean weight: 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 \u00b1 8 liters and the distribution half-life was 15 \u00b1 2 minutes. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination After a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose, 22% \u00b1 4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38% \u00b1 7% as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194 \u00b1 149 mL/min and the terminal half-life was 115 \u00b1 19 minutes. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated.

Increases of up to 1.8 times the control values were seen in the thrombin time (TT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Enoxaparin at a 1 mg/kg dose (100 mg/mL concentration), administered subcutaneously every 12 hours to patients in a large clinical trial resulted in aPTT values of 45 seconds or less in the majority of patients (n=1607). A 30 mg intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous administration resulted in aPTT postinjection values of 50 seconds. The average aPTT prolongation value on Day 1 was about 16% higher than on Day 4. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Pharmacokinetic trials were conducted using the 100 mg/mL formulation. Maximum anti-Factor Xa and anti-thrombin (anti-Factor IIa) activities occur 3 to 5 hours after subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin. Mean peak anti-Factor Xa activity was 0.16 IU/mL (1.58 mcg/mL) and 0.38 IU/mL (3.83 mcg/mL) after the 20 mg and the 40 mg clinically tested subcutaneous doses, respectively. Mean (n=46) peak anti-Factor Xa activity was 1.1 IU/mL at steady state in patients with unstable angina receiving 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours for 14 days. Mean absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin, after 1.5 mg/kg given subcutaneously, based on anti-Factor Xa activity is approximately 100% in healthy subjects. A 30 mg intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours provided initial peak anti-Factor Xa levels of 1.16 IU/mL (n=16) and average exposure corresponding to 84% of steady-state levels. Steady state is achieved on the second day of treatment. Enoxaparin pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After repeated subcutaneous administration of 40 mg once daily and 1.5 mg/kg once-daily regimens in healthy volunteers, the steady state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio about 15% higher than after a single dose. Steady-state enoxaparin activity levels are well predicted by single-dose pharmacokinetics. After repeated subcutaneous administration of the 1 mg/kg twice-daily regimen, the steady state is reached from day 4 with mean exposure about 65% higher than after a single dose and mean peak and trough levels of about 1.2 and 0.52 IU/mL, respectively. Based on enoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics, this difference in steady state is expected and within the therapeutic range. Although not studied clinically, the 150 mg/mL concentration of enoxaparin sodium is projected to result in anticoagulant activities similar to those of 100 mg/mL and 200 mg/mL concentrations at the same enoxaparin dose. When a daily 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin sodium was given to 25 healthy male and female subjects using a 100 mg/mL or a 200 mg/mL concentration the following pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained (see Table 13).

Elimination Following intravenous dosing, the total body clearance of enoxaparin is 26 mL/min. After intravenous dosing of enoxaparin labeled with the gamma-emitter, 99m Tc, 40% of radioactivity and 8 to 20% of anti-Factor Xa activity were recovered in urine in 24 hours. Elimination half-life based on anti-Factor Xa activity was 4.5 hours after a single subcutaneous dose to about 7 hours after repeated dosing. Significant anti-Factor Xa activity persists in plasma for about 12 hours following a 40 mg subcutaneous once a day dose. Following subcutaneous dosing, the apparent clearance (CL/F) of enoxaparin is approximately 15 mL/min. Metabolism Enoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerization to lower molecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. Renal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion of active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose. Special Populations Gender Apparent clearance and A max derived from anti-Factor Xa values following single subcutaneous dosing (40 mg and 60 mg) were slightly higher in males than in females. The source of the gender difference in these parameters has not been conclusively identified; however, body weight may be a contributing factor. Geriatric Apparent clearance and A max derived from anti-Factor Xa values following single and multiple subcutaneous dosing in geriatric subjects were close to those observed in young subjects. Following once a day subcutaneous dosing of 40 mg enoxaparin, the Day 10 mean area under anti-Factor Xa activity versus time curve (AUC) was approximately 15% greater than the mean Day 1 AUC value [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Renal Impairment A linear relationship between anti-Factor Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady state has been observed, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. Anti-Factor Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady state, is marginally increased in patients with creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min and patients with creatinine clearance 30 to <50 mL/min after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Hemodialysis In a single study, elimination rate appeared similar but AUC was two-fold higher than control population, after a single 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg intravenous dose. Hepatic Impairment Studies with enoxaparin in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted and the impact of hepatic impairment on the exposure to enoxaparin is unknown. Weight After repeated subcutaneous 1.5 mg/kg once-daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Factor Xa activity is marginally higher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30-48 kg/m 2 ) compared to non-obese control subjects, while A max is not increased. When non \u2013 weight-adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-subcutaneous 40 mg dose, that anti-Factor Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (<45 kg) and 27% higher in low-weight men (<57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)] .

It is an even more potent inhibitor of GH, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, VIP, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces GH and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Octreotide suppresses secretion of TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, IV and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional after IV single doses up to 200 mcg and subcutaneous single doses up to 500 mcg and after subcutaneous multiple doses up to 500 mcg 3 times a day (1,500 mcg/day). In patients with acromegaly, a mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. Distribution In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b1\u00bd = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr. In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. In patients with acromegaly, the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L, and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. Elimination The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone. The duration of action of octreotide acetate injection is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normal subjects. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR 40 to 60 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (CL CR 10 to 39 mL/min) t 1/2 was 3.0 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr. In patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CL CR < 10 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr. In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, total body clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/hr to 4.5 L/hr). Hepatic Impairment Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t 1/2 increasing to 3.7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t 1/2 increased to 3.4 hr and total body clearance of 8.2 L/hr. 12.6 Immunogenicity Evaluation of 20 patients treated for at least 6 months has failed to demonstrate titers of antibodies exceeding background levels.

In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor added to bupivacaine to slow absorption into the general circulation and thus prolong maintenance of an active tissue concentration. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic absorption of bupivacaine produces effects on the cardiovascular system and CNS. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. These cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Following systemic absorption, bupivacaine can produce CNS stimulation, CNS depression, or both. Apparent central stimulation is manifested as restlessness, tremors, and shivering, progressing to convulsions, followed by CNS depression and coma progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest. However, bupivacaine has a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited state. The duration of local anesthesia after administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is longer than that observed after administration of other commonly used short-acting local anesthetics. There appears to be period of analgesia that persists after the resolution of the block and return of sensation. The onset of action following dental injections is usually 2 to 10 minutes and may last up to 7 hours. The duration of anesthetic effect is prolonged by the addition of epinephrine 1:200,000. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection do not correlate with local efficacy. Absorption The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000) usually reduces the rate of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine, permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and sometimes prolonging the duration of action [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After injection of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next three to six hours. Distribution Bupivacaine appears to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of bupivacaine appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity (95%) has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4). The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, bupivacaine is distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profile of bupivacaine after direct intravenous injection (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is not approved for intravenous use) suggest a three-compartment open model. The first compartment is represented by the rapid intravascular distribution of the drug. The second compartment represents the equilibration of the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as the brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and liver. The third compartment represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly perfused tissues, such as muscle and fat. Elimination The half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours. Metabolism Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine. The elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely upon the availability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized. Excretion The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Elderly patients exhibited higher peak plasma concentrations than younger patients following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection. The total plasma clearance was decreased in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic disease. Patients with hepatic disease, especially those with severe hepatic disease, may be more susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local anesthetics [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of renal disease, factors affecting urinary pH, and renal blood flow [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.7) ] .", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt retaining properties, are used in replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are used primarily for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine hydrochloride stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine hydrochloride is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine hydrochloride is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine hydrochloride crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine hydrochloride. Approximately 90% of lidocaine hydrochloride administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine hydrochloride following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine hydrochloride required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl\u203e) ions. These ions are normal constituents of the body fluids (principally extracellular) and are essential for maintaining electrolyte balance.

In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor added to bupivacaine to slow absorption into the general circulation and thus prolong maintenance of an active tissue concentration. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic absorption of bupivacaine produces effects on the cardiovascular system and CNS. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. These cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Following systemic absorption, bupivacaine can produce CNS stimulation, CNS depression, or both. Apparent central stimulation is manifested as restlessness, tremors, and shivering, progressing to convulsions, followed by CNS depression and coma progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest. However, bupivacaine has a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited state. The duration of local anesthesia after administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is longer than that observed after administration of other commonly used short-acting local anesthetics. There appears to be period of analgesia that persists after the resolution of the block and return of sensation. The onset of action following dental injections is usually 2 to 10 minutes and may last up to 7 hours. The duration of anesthetic effect is prolonged by the addition of epinephrine 1:200,000. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection do not correlate with local efficacy. Absorption The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000) usually reduces the rate of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine, permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and sometimes prolonging the duration of action [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After injection of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next three to six hours. Distribution Bupivacaine appears to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of bupivacaine appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity (95%) has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4). The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, bupivacaine is distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profile of bupivacaine after direct intravenous injection (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is not approved for intravenous use) suggest a three-compartment open model. The first compartment is represented by the rapid intravascular distribution of the drug. The second compartment represents the equilibration of the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as the brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and liver. The third compartment represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly perfused tissues, such as muscle and fat. Elimination The half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours. Metabolism Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine. The elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely upon the availability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized. Excretion The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Elderly patients exhibited higher peak plasma concentrations than younger patients following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection. The total plasma clearance was decreased in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic disease. Patients with hepatic disease, especially those with severe hepatic disease, may be more susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local anesthetics [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of renal disease, factors affecting urinary pH, and renal blood flow [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.7) ] .", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt retaining properties, are used in replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are used primarily for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine hydrochloride stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine hydrochloride is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine hydrochloride is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine hydrochloride crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine hydrochloride. Approximately 90% of lidocaine hydrochloride administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine hydrochloride following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine hydrochloride required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl\u203e) ions. These ions are normal constituents of the body fluids (principally extracellular) and are essential for maintaining electrolyte balance.

Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg.

These effects include the growth and maturation of prostate, seminal vesicles, penis and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution such as beard, pubic, chest and axillary hair, laryngeal enlargements, vocal cord thickening, alterations in body musculature and fat distribution. Drugs in this class can also cause retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and decreased urinary excretion of calcium. Androgens have been reported to increase protein anabolism and decrease protein catabolism. Nitrogen balance is improved only when there is sufficient intake of calories and protein. Androgens are responsible for the growth spurt of adolescence and for the eventual termination of linear growth which is brought about by the fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers. In children, exogenous androgens accelerate linear growth rates, but may cause a disproportionate advancement in bone maturation. Use over long periods may result in fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers and termination of growth process. Androgens have been reported to stimulate the production of red blood cells by enhancing the production of erythropoietic stimulating factor. During exogenous administration of androgens, endogenous testosterone release is inhibited through feedback inhibition of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH). At large doses of exogenous androgens, spermatogenesis may also be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). There is a lack of substantial evidence that androgens are effective in fractures, surgery, convalescence, and functional uterine bleeding. PHARMACOKINETICS Testosterone in plasma is 98 percent bound to a specific testosterone-estradiol binding globulin, and about 2 percent is free. Generally, the amount of this sex-hormone binding globulin in the plasma will determine the distribution of testosterone between the free and bound forms, and the free testosterone concentration will determine its half-life. About 90 percent of a dose of testosterone is excreted as glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites; about 6 percent of a dose is excreted in feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver. Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways. There are considerable variations of the half-life as reported in the literature, ranging from 10-100 minutes. In many tissues the activity of testosterone appears to depend on reduction to dihydrotestosterone, which binds to cytosol receptor proteins.

Diastolic pressure falls. Renal blood flow is decreased in normotensive subjects but is increased markedly in shock. Systolic blood pressure may remain unchanged or rise, although mean arterial pressure typically falls. Cardiac output is increased because of the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of the drug in the face of diminished peripheral vascular resistance.

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro . Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following twice weekly administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 bortezomib doses, the maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (relative to baseline) in whole blood was observed five minutes after drug administration. Comparable maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was observed between 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses.

Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m 2 dose to patients with multiple myeloma, the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC last ) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The AUC last geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) was 0.99 (0.80 to 1.23). The C max after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/mL) was lower than after intravenous administration (223 ng/mL) with repeat dose administration. Distribution The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 L/m 2 following single- or repeat-dose administration of 1 mg/m 2 or 1.3 mg/m 2 to patients with multiple myeloma. The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively.

Azacitidine for injection is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms.Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination MetabolismAn in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours.

This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted.In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes:An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u00b5M) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems :An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp.

Increases of up to 1.8 times the control values were seen in the thrombin time (TT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Enoxaparin at a 1 mg/kg dose (100 mg/mL concentration), administered subcutaneously every 12 hours to patients in a large clinical trial resulted in aPTT values of 45 seconds or less in the majority of patients (n=1607). A 30 mg intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous administration resulted in aPTT postinjection values of 50 seconds. The average aPTT prolongation value on Day 1 was about 16% higher than on Day 4. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Pharmacokinetic trials were conducted using the 100 mg/mL formulation. Maximum anti-Factor Xa and anti-thrombin (anti-Factor IIa) activities occur 3 to 5 hours after subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin. Mean peak anti-Factor Xa activity was 0.16 IU/mL (1.58 mcg/mL) and 0.38 IU/mL (3.83 mcg/mL) after the 20 mg and the 40 mg clinically tested subcutaneous doses, respectively. Mean (n=46) peak anti-Factor Xa activity was 1.1 IU/mL at steady state in patients with unstable angina receiving 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours for 14 days. Mean absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin, after 1.5 mg/kg given subcutaneously, based on anti-Factor Xa activity is approximately 100% in healthy subjects. A 30 mg intravenous bolus immediately followed by 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours provided initial peak anti-Factor Xa levels of 1.16 IU/mL (n=16) and average exposure corresponding to 84% of steady-state levels. Steady state is achieved on the second day of treatment. Enoxaparin pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After repeated subcutaneous administration of 40 mg once daily and 1.5 mg/kg once-daily regimens in healthy volunteers, the steady state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio about 15% higher than after a single dose. Steady-state enoxaparin activity levels are well predicted by single-dose pharmacokinetics. After repeated subcutaneous administration of the 1 mg/kg twice-daily regimen, the steady state is reached from day 4 with mean exposure about 65% higher than after a single dose and mean peak and trough levels of about 1.2 and 0.52 IU/mL, respectively. Based on enoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics, this difference in steady state is expected and within the therapeutic range. Although not studied clinically, the 150 mg/mL concentration of enoxaparin sodium is projected to result in anticoagulant activities similar to those of 100 mg/mL and 200 mg/mL concentrations at the same enoxaparin dose. When a daily 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin sodium was given to 25 healthy male and female subjects using a 100 mg/mL or a 200 mg/mL concentration the following pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained (see Table 13 ).

Elimination Following intravenous dosing, the total body clearance of enoxaparin is 26 mL/min. After intravenous dosing of enoxaparin labeled with the gamma-emitter, 99m Tc, 40% of radioactivity and 8 to 20% of anti-Factor Xa activity were recovered in urine in 24 hours. Elimination half-life based on anti-Factor Xa activity was 4.5 hours after a single subcutaneous dose to about 7 hours after repeated dosing. Significant anti-Factor Xa activity persists in plasma for about 12 hours following a 40 mg subcutaneous once a day dose. Following subcutaneous dosing, the apparent clearance (CL/F) of enoxaparin is approximately 15 mL/min. Metabolism Enoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerization to lower molecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. Renal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion of active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose. Special Populations Gender Apparent clearance and A max derived from anti-Factor Xa values following single subcutaneous dosing (40 mg and 60 mg) were slightly higher in males than in females. The source of the gender difference in these parameters has not been conclusively identified; however, body weight may be a contributing factor. Geriatric Apparent clearance and A max derived from anti-Factor Xa values following single and multiple subcutaneous dosing in geriatric subjects were close to those observed in young subjects. Following once a day subcutaneous dosing of 40 mg enoxaparin, the Day 10 mean area under anti-Factor Xa activity versus time curve (AUC) was approximately 15% greater than the mean Day 1 AUC value [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Renal impairment A linear relationship between anti-Factor Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady state has been observed, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. Anti-Factor Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady state, is marginally increased in patients with creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min and patients with creatinine clearance 30 to <50 mL/min after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Hemodialysis In a single study, elimination rate appeared similar but AUC was two-fold higher than control population, after a single 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg intravenous dose. Hepatic impairment Studies with enoxaparin in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted and the impact of hepatic impairment on the exposure to enoxaparin is unknown. Weight After repeated subcutaneous 1.5 mg/kg once-daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Factor Xa activity is marginally higher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30\u201348 kg/m 2 ) compared to non-obese control subjects, while A max is not increased. When non\u2013weight-adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-subcutaneous 40 mg dose, that anti-Factor Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (<45 kg) and 27% higher in low-weight men (<57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8) ] .

This hypothesis is supported by findings of studies that have been carried out to explore the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a condition induced in animals through immunization against central nervous system derived material containing myelin and often used as an experimental animal model of MS. Studies in animals and in vitro systems suggest that upon its administration, glatiramer acetate-specific suppressor T-cells are induced and activated in the periphery.

ADMELOG is latex free."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Regulation of glucose metabolism is the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogs, including insulin lispro products. Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis and enhance protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of ADMELOG After Subcutaneous Injection The pharmacodynamic profile of a single 0.3 unit/kg dose of ADMELOG administered subcutaneously was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study enrolling 30 patients with type 1 diabetes. In this study, the mean (SD) time to maximum effect of ADMELOG (measured by the peak rate of glucose infusion) was approximately 2.1 (0.8) hours. The mean (SD) area under the glucose infusion rate curves (measure of overall pharmacodynamic effect) and mean (SD) maximum glucose infusion rate were 1953.5 (547.3) mg/kg and 9.97 (2.37) mg/min/kg, respectively (see Figure 1 ). Figure 1: Mean Smoothed Glucose Infusion Rate Body Weight Standardized after Subcutaneous Injection of ADMELOG (0.3 unit/kg) in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs, including insulin lispro products, may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual. The rate of insulin absorption and, consequently, the onset of activity are known to be affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Figure 1 Pharmacodynamics of AMELOG after Intravenous Administration The glucose lowering effect of intravenous administration of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, was tested in 21 patients with type 1 diabetes. For the study, the patients' usual doses of insulin were held, and blood glucose concentrations were allowed to reach a stable range of 200 to 260 mg/dL during a one to three-hour run-in phase. The run-in phase was followed by a 6-hour assessment phase. During the assessment phase, patients received intravenous infusion of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, at an initial infusion rate of 0.5 units/hour. The infusion rate could be adjusted at regular timed intervals to achieve and maintain blood glucose concentrations between 100 to 160 mg/dL. The mean blood glucose levels during the assessment phase for patients on another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, therapy are summarized below in Table 3. All patients achieved the targeted glucose range at some point during the 6-hour assessment phase. At the endpoint, blood glucose was within the target range (100 to 160 mg/dL) for 17 of 20 patients treated with another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL. The average time (\u00b1SE) required to attain near normoglycemia was 129 \u00b1 14 minutes for another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL.

In this study, the mean observed area under the plasma insulin lispro concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity and peak plasma insulin lispro concentration were 12800 pg\u2219hr/mL and 5070 pg/mL, respectively. The median time to maximum plasma insulin lispro concentration was 0.83 hours after injection (see Figure 2 ). Figure 2: Mean Plasma Concentrations of ADMELOG after a Single Subcutaneous Administration of ADMELOG (0.3 unit/kg) in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes The absolute bioavailability of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, after subcutaneous injection ranges from 55% to 77% with doses between 0.1 to 0.2 unit/kg, inclusive. Figure 2 Distribution When administered intravenously as bolus injections of 0.1 and 0.2 unit/kg dose in two separate groups of healthy subjects, the mean volume of distribution of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, appeared to decrease with increase in dose (1.55 and 0.72 L/kg, respectively). Elimination Metabolism Human metabolism studies have not been conducted. However, animal studies indicate that the metabolism of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, is identical to that of regular human insulin. Excretion When administered intravenously, another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL demonstrated dose-dependent clearance, with a mean clearance of 21.0 mL/min/kg (0.1 unit/kg dose), and 9.6 mL/min/kg (0.2 unit/kg dose). Another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, demonstrated a mean t 1/2 of 0.85 hours (51 minutes) and 0.92 hours (55 minutes), respectively for 0.1 unit/kg and 0.2 unit/kg doses. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, race, obesity, pregnancy, or smoking on the pharmacokinetics of ADMELOG have not been studied. Patients with Renal Impairment Type 2 diabetic patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed no difference in pharmacokinetics of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL. However, the sensitivity of the patients to insulin did change, with an increased response to insulin as the renal function declined. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Type 2 diabetic patients with impaired hepatic function showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, as compared to patients with no hepatic dysfunction.

Somatrogon-ghla binding leads to activation of the STAT5b signaling pathway and increases the serum concentration of Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1). GH and IGF-1 stimulate metabolic changes, linear growth, and enhance growth velocity in pediatric patients with GHD. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following single dose administration of somatrogon, dose-dependent increases in IGF-1 response were observed. Following multiple dosing, IGF-1 SDS levels were in the normal range for pediatric patients with GHD, similar to daily somatropin. IGF-1 levels peak approximately 2 days (48 hours) post-dose, with the average weekly IGF-1 occurring approximately 4 days post-dose. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Somatrogon-ghla pharmacokinetics (PK) was assessed using a population PK approach for NGENLA in 151 pediatric patients (aged 3 to 15.5 years) with GHD. Absorption Following subcutaneous injection, serum concentrations increased slowly, peaking 6 to 25 hours with a median of 11 hours after dosing. In pediatric patients with GHD, somatrogon-ghla exposure increases in a dose-proportional manner for doses of 0.25 mg/kg/wk, 0.48 mg/kg/wk, and 0.66 mg/kg/wk. There is no accumulation of somatrogon-ghla after once weekly administration. In pediatric patients with GHD, the mean population PK estimated steady-state peak concentrations (mean \u00b1 SD) following 0.66 mg/kg/wk was 495 \u00b1 90 ng/mL. Distribution In pediatric patients with GHD, the mean population PK estimated apparent central volume of distribution was 0.342 L/kg and apparent peripheral volume of distribution was 0.671 L/kg. Elimination In pediatric patients with GHD, the mean population PK estimated apparent clearance was 0.0398 L/h/kg. The mean population PK estimated effective half-life was 37.7 hours, which allows for weekly dosing. Somatrogon-ghla will be present in the circulation for about 8 days after the last dose. Metabolism The metabolism of somatrogon-ghla is believed to be classical protein catabolism, with subsequent recovery of the amino acids and return to the systemic circulation. Excretion Excretion was not evaluated in clinical studies. Specific Populations Based on population PK analyses, age, sex, race, and ethnicity do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of somatrogon-ghla in pediatric patients with GHD. The exposure of somatrogon-ghla decreases with an increase in body weight. However, the somatrogon-ghla dosing regimen of 0.66 mg/kg/wk provides adequate systemic exposure over the body weight range of 10 to 54 kg evaluated in the clinical studies. Renal or Hepatic Impairment NGENLA has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of somatrogon or other growth hormone products. During the 12-month main period of study NCT 02968004, 84/109 (77.1%) of somatrogon-ghla\u2011treated patients tested positive for anti-drug antibodies, with most showing specificity to human growth hormone. The anti-drug antibodies persisted in most of the subjects during the study. Neutralizing antibodies developed in 8/217 (3.7%) of somatrogon-ghla-treated patients during the study for up to 42 months of exposure to somatrogon-ghla.

Anti-drug antibodies, including neutralizing-antibodies, did not appear to have a clinically significant impact on the safety or effectiveness of NGENLA during the 12\u2011month randomized treatment period. Additionally, no apparent effect of anti-drug antibodies on growth was observed for additional 30 months of exposure to somatrogon-ghla in the uncontrolled extension period of study NCT 02968004.

Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route.

It also binds with high affinity to serotonin 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , and 5-HT 2C receptors, noradrenaline \u03b1 2A , \u03b1 2B and \u03b1 1 receptors, and dopamine D 2L and D 3 receptors. The therapeutic activity of dihydroergotamine in migraine is generally attributed to the agonist effect at 5-HT 1D receptors. Two current theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT 1D receptor agonists in migraine. One theory suggests that activation of 5-HT 1D receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on arterio-venous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache. The alternative hypothesis suggests that activation of 5-HT 1D receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. In addition, dihydroergotamine possesses oxytocic properties. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Absolute bioavailability for the subcutaneous and intramuscular route have not been determined, however, no difference was observed in dihydroergotamine bioavailability from intramuscular and subcutaneous doses. Dihydroergotamine mesylate is poorly bioavailable following oral administration. Distribution Dihydroergotamine mesylate is 93% plasma protein bound. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 800 liters. Metabolism Four dihydroergotamine mesylate metabolites have been identified in human plasma following oral administration. The major metabolite, 8\u00b4-\u03b2-hydroxydihydroergotamine, exhibits affinity equivalent to its parent for adrenergic and 5-HT receptors and demonstrates equivalent potency in several venoconstrictor activity models, in vivo and in vitro . The other metabolites, (i.e., dihydrolysergic acid, dihydrolysergic amide) and a metabolite formed by oxidative opening of the proline ring are of minor importance. Following nasal administration, total metabolites represent only 20% to 30% of plasma AUC. Quantitative pharmacokinetic characterization of the four metabolites has not been performed. Excretion The major excretory route of dihydroergotamine is via the bile in the feces. The total body clearance is 1.5 L/min which reflects mainly hepatic clearance. Only 6% to 7% of unchanged dihydroergotamine is excreted in the urine after intramuscular injection. The renal clearance (0.1 L/min) is unaffected by the route of dihydroergotamine administration. The decline of plasma dihydroergotamine after intramuscular or intravenous administration is multi-exponential with a terminal half-life of about 9 hours.

PLEGRIDY did not accumulate in the serum after multiple doses of 125 micrograms every 14 days. Pharmacokinetic parameters for PLEGRIDY, including C max and AUC, did not differ significantly between healthy volunteers and multiple sclerosis patients or between single-dose and multiple-dose administrations. However, the coefficient of variation between individual patients for AUC, C max , and half-life was high (41% to 68%, 74% to 89%, and 45% to 93%, respectively). Absorption After 125 microgram subcutaneous doses of PLEGRIDY in multiple sclerosis patients, the maximum concentration occurred between 1 and 1.5 days, the mean C max was 280 pg/mL, and the AUC over the 14 day dosing interval was 34.8 ng.hr/mL. Distribution In multiple sclerosis patients taking 125 microgram subcutaneous doses of PLEGRIDY every 14 days, the estimated volume of distribution was 481 liters. Metabolism and Elimination Clearance mechanisms for PLEGRIDY include catabolism and excretion. The major pathway of elimination is renal.

The pH of the sterile injectable solution is between 3.0 to 6.5. Methadone Hydrochloride Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Methadone hydrochloride is a mu-agonist; a synthetic opioid analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine, the most prominent of which involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. The principal therapeutic uses for methadone are for analgesia and for detoxification or maintenance in opioid addiction. The methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe. Some data also indicate that methadone acts as an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The contribution of NMDA receptor antagonism to methadone\u2019s efficacy is unknown. Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Methadone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Methadone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Some NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to produce neurotoxic effects in animals. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Methadone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Methadone produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of methadone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing methadone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Methadone Hydrochloride Injection is intended for parenteral (intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular) administration. Methadone pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration have not been systematically studied and differences among the various parenteral routes have not been well characterized. As with many drugs, absorption into the systemic circulation may vary with subcutaneous and intramuscular administration. Distribution Methadone is a lipophilic drug and the steady state volume of distribution ranges between 2 L/kg to 6 L/kg. In plasma, methadone is predominantly bound to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein (85% to 90%). Methadone is secreted in saliva, breast milk, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord plasma. Elimination Metabolism Methadone is primarily metabolized by N-demethylation to an inactive metabolite, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidene (EDDP). Cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, are responsible for conversion of methadone to EDDP and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted mainly in urine. Excretion Elimination of methadone is mediated by extensive biotransformation, followed by renal and fecal excretion. After single intravenous dose administration the plasma clearance of methadone ranged between 3 L/h to 10 L/h and the terminal half-life (t \u00bd ) ranged between 8 to 59 hours. Methadone has been known to persist in the liver and other tissues. Slow release from the liver and other tissues may prolong the duration of methadone action despite low plasma concentrations. Specific Populations Use During Pregnancy There are no pharmacokinetic studies of parenteral methadone in pregnancy. The disposition of oral methadone has been studied in approximately 30 pregnant patients in 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters. Elimination of methadone was significantly changed in pregnancy. Total body clearance of methadone was increased in pregnant patients compared to the same patients postpartum or to non-pregnant opioid-dependent women. The terminal half-life of methadone is decreased during second and third trimesters. The decrease in plasma half-life and increased clearance of methadone resulting in lower methadone trough levels during pregnancy can lead to withdrawal symptoms in some pregnant patients. The dosage may need to be increased or the dosing interval decreased in pregnant patients receiving methadone (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Impairment Methadone pharmacokinetics have not been extensively evaluated in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Methadone is metabolized in the liver and patients with liver impairment may be at risk of accumulating methadone after multiple dosing. Renal Impairment Methadone pharmacokinetics have not been extensively evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. Unchanged methadone and its metabolites are excreted in urine to a variable degree. Methadone is a basic (pKa = 9.2) compound and the luminal pH of the urinary tract can affect its extraction from plasma. Urine acidification has been shown to increase renal elimination of methadone. Forced diuresis, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been established as beneficial for increasing methadone or metabolite elimination. Sex The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated for sex specificity. Race The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated for race specificity. Age Geriatric Population: The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated in geriatric population. Pediatric Population: The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated in pediatric population. Drug Interaction Studies Cytochrome P450 Interactions Methadone undergoes hepatic N-demethylation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, principally CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. Co-administration of methadone with CYP inducers may result in more rapid metabolism and potential for decreased effects of methadone, whereas administration with CYP inhibitors may reduce metabolism and potentiate methadone\u2019s effects. Although antiretroviral drugs such as efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, lopinavir+ritonavir combination are known to inhibit some CYPs, they are shown to reduce the plasma levels of methadone, possibly due to CYP induction activity (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Cytochrome P450 Inducers The following drug interactions were reported following co-administration of methadone with known inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes: Rifampin In patients well-stabilized on methadone, concomitant administration of rifampin resulted in a marked reduction in serum methadone levels and a concurrent appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Phenytoin In a pharmacokinetic study with patients on methadone maintenance therapy, phenytoin administration (250 mg twice daily initially for 1 day followed by 300 mg daily for 3 to 4 days) resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in methadone exposure and withdrawal symptoms occurred concurrently. Upon discontinuation of phenytoin, the incidence of withdrawal symptoms decreased and methadone exposure increased to a level comparable to that prior to phenytoin administration. St. John\u2019s Wort, Phenobarbital, Carbamazepine Administration of methadone with other CYP3A4 inducers may result in withdrawal symptoms. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors Voriconazole Voriconazole can inhibit the activity of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Repeat dose administration of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 4 days) increased the peak plasma concentration (C max ) and AUC of (R)-methadone by 31% and 47%, respectively, in subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (30 mg to 100 mg daily. The C max and AUC of (S)-methadone increased by 65% and 103%, respectively. Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during co-administration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Antiretroviral Drugs Although antiretroviral drugs such as efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, telaprevir, lopinavir+ritonavir combination are known to inhibit some CYPs, they are shown to reduce the plasma levels of methadone, possibly due to CYP induction activity. Abacavir, amprenavir, darunavir+ritonavir, efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, telaprevir, lopinavir+ritonavir, saquinavir+ritonavir, tipranvir+ritonavir combination Co-administration of these anti-retroviral agents resulted in increased clearance or decreased plasma levels of methadone (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Didanosine and Stavudine Methadone decreased the AUC and peak levels for didanosine and stavudine, with a more significant decrease for didanosine. Methadone disposition was not substantially altered (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Zidovudine Methadone increased the AUC of zidovudine which could result in toxic effects (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Pregnancy There are no pharmacokinetic studies of parenteral methadone in pregnancy. The disposition of oral methadone has been studied in approximately 30 pregnant patients in 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters. Elimination of methadone was significantly changed in pregnancy.

The molecule is a fusion protein that consists of 2 identical, disulfide-linked chains, each containing an N-terminal GLP-1 analog sequence covalently linked to the Fc portion of a modified human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) heavy chain by a small peptide linker and is produced using mammalian cell (Chinese hamster ovary) culture. The GLP-1 analog portion of dulaglutide is 90% homologous to native human GLP-1 (7-37). Structural modifications were introduced in the GLP-1 part of the molecule responsible for interaction with the enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV (DPP-4). Additional modifications were made in an area with a potential T-cell epitope and in the areas of the IgG4 Fc part of the molecule responsible for binding the high-affinity Fc receptors and half-antibody formation. The overall molecular weight of dulaglutide is approximately 63 kilodaltons. TRULICITY (dulaglutide) injection is a clear, colorless, sterile, preservative-free solution for subcutaneous use. Each single-dose pen contains a 0.5 mL solution of 0.75 mg, 1.5 mg, 3 mg, or 4.5 mg of dulaglutide and the following excipients: citric acid anhydrous (0.07 mg), mannitol (23.2 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.10 mg for 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg; 0.125 mg for 3 mg and 4.5 mg), and trisodium citrate dihydrate (1.37 mg), in water for injection."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action TRULICITY contains dulaglutide, which is a human GLP-1 receptor agonist with 90% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1 (7-37). Dulaglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase in pancreatic beta cells. Dulaglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) in beta cells leading to glucose-dependent insulin release. Dulaglutide also decreases glucagon secretion and slows gastric emptying. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics TRULICITY lowers fasting glucose and reduces postprandial glucose (PPG) concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The reduction in fasting and postprandial glucose can be observed after a single dose. Fasting and Postprandial Glucose In a clinical pharmacology study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, treatment with once weekly TRULICITY resulted in a reduction of fasting and 2-hour PPG concentrations, and postprandial serum glucose incremental AUC, when compared to placebo (-25.6 mg/dL, -59.5 mg/dL, and -197 mg*h/dL, respectively); these effects were sustained after 6 weeks of dosing with the 1.5 mg dose. First- and Second-Phase Insulin Secretion Both first- and second-phase insulin secretion were increased in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with TRULICITY compared with placebo. Insulin and Glucagon Secretion TRULICITY stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion. Treatment with TRULICITY 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg once weekly increased fasting insulin from baseline at Week 26 by 35.38 and 17.50 pmol/L, respectively, and C-peptide concentration by 0.09 and 0.07 nmol/L, respectively, in a monotherapy trial. In the same trial, fasting glucagon concentration was reduced by 1.71 and 2.05 pmol/L from baseline with TRULICITY 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, respectively. Gastric Motility Dulaglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying. The delay in gastric emptying is dose-dependent but is attenuated with adequate dose escalation to higher doses of TRULICITY. The delay is largest after the first dose and diminishes with subsequent doses. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of dulaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc study. Dulaglutide did not produce QTc prolongation at doses of 4 and 7 mg. The maximum recommended dose is 4.5 mg once weekly. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide is similar between healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following subcutaneous administration, the time to maximum plasma concentration of dulaglutide at steady state ranges from 24 to 72 hours, with a median of 48 hours. After reaching steady state, the accumulation ratio was approximately 1.56. Steady-state plasma dulaglutide concentrations were achieved between 2 and 4 weeks following once weekly administration. Site of subcutaneous administration (abdomen, upper arm, and thigh) had no statistically significant effect on the exposure to dulaglutide. Absorption \u2013 The mean absolute bioavailability of dulaglutide following subcutaneous administration of single 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg doses was 65% and 47%, respectively. Absolute subcutaneous bioavailability for 3 mg and 4.5 mg doses were estimated to be similar to 1.5 mg although this has not been specifically studied. Dulaglutide concentrations increased approximately proportional to dose from 0.75 mg to 4.5 mg. Distribution \u2013 Apparent population mean central volume of distribution was 3.09 L and the apparent population mean peripheral volume of distribution was 5.98 L. Elimination The apparent population mean clearance of dulaglutide was 0.142 L/h. The elimination half-life of dulaglutide was approximately 5 days. Metabolism \u2013 Dulaglutide is presumed to be degraded into its component amino acids by general protein catabolism pathways. Specific Populations The intrinsic factors of age (\u2265 65 years), sex, race, ethnicity, body weight, or renal or hepatic impairment did not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of dulaglutide as shown in Figure 1 . Abbreviations: AUC = area under the time-concentration curve; CI = confidence interval; C max = maximum concentration; ESRD = end-stage renal disease; PK = pharmacokinetics. Note: Reference values for weight, age, gender, and race comparisons are 93 kg, 56 years old, male, and white, respectively; reference groups for renal and hepatic impairment data are subjects with normal renal and hepatic function from the respective clinical pharmacology studies. The weight values shown in the plot (70 and 120 kg) are the 10 th and 90 th percentiles of weight in the PK population. Figure 1: Impact of intrinsic factors on dulaglutide pharmacokinetics. Figure 1 Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg using data from 128 pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The AUC in pediatric patients was approximately 37% lower than that in adult patients. However, this difference was not determined to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Dulaglutide systemic exposure was increased by 20, 28, 14 and 12% for mild, moderate, severe, and ESRD renal impairment sub-groups, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. The corresponding values for increase in C max were 13, 23, 20 and 11%, respectively ( Figure 1 ). Additionally, in a 52 week clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate to severe renal impairment, the PK behavior of TRULICITY 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg once weekly was similar to that demonstrated in previous clinical studies [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Dulaglutide systemic exposure decreased by 23, 33 and 21% for mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment groups, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, and C max was decreased by a similar magnitude ( Figure 1 ) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interaction Studies The potential effect of co-administered medications on the PK of dulaglutide 1.5 mg and vice versa was studied in several single- and multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and patients with hypertension. Potential for Dulaglutide to Influence the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs Dulaglutide slows gastric emptying and, as a result, may reduce the extent and rate of absorption of orally co-administered medications. In clinical pharmacology studies, dulaglutide at a dose of 1.5 mg did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree. The delay in gastric emptying is dose-dependent but is attenuated with the recommended dose escalation to higher doses of TRULICITY [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . The delay is largest after the first dose and diminishes with subsequent doses. PK measures indicating the magnitude of these interactions are presented in Figure 2 . Abbreviations: AUC = area under the time-concentration curve; CI = confidence interval; C max = maximum concentration; PK = pharmacokinetics. Note: Reference group is co-administered medication given alone. Figure 2: Impact of dulaglutide 1.5 mg on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medications. Figure 2 Potential for Co-administered Drugs to Influence the Pharmacokinetics of Dulaglutide In a clinical pharmacology study, the co-administration of a single dose of 1.5 mg dulaglutide with steady-state dose of 100 mg sitagliptin caused an increase in dulaglutide AUC and C max of approximately 38% and 27%, which is not considered clinically relevant. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies. In glycemic control trials in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (monotherapy and combination therapy) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 , 14.3 )] , during a treatment period ranging from 24 to 104 weeks, 64/3,907 (1.6%) of TRULICITY-treated patients developed anti-dulaglutide antibodies (referred to as anti-drug-antibodies (ADA)). Of the 64 TRULICITY-treated patients that developed ADA, 34 patients (0.9% of the overall population) developed dulaglutide-neutralizing antibodies, and 36 patients (0.9% of the overall population) developed antibodies against native GLP-1. There was no identified clinically significant effect of ADA on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, or effectiveness of TRULICITY over the 24 to 104 week treatment duration in the trials in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. During the 26-week controlled period of the glycemic control trial in pediatric patients 10 years of age or older with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )] , 4/101 (4%) of TRULICITY-treated pediatric patients developed ADA. Of the 4 pediatric patients that developed ADA, 1 patient (1% of the overall population) developed dulaglutide-neutralizing antibodies and 3 patients (3% of the overall population) developed antibodies against native GLP-1. During the 52-week postbaseline period of the same trial (through safety follow-up), 6/103 (6%) of TRULICITY-treated patients developed ADA. Of the 6 patients that developed ADA, 1 patient (1% of the overall population) developed dulaglutide-neutralizing antibodies and 4 patients (4% of the overall population) developed antibodies against native GLP-1. Because of the low occurrence of ADA, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of TRULICITY is unknown in pediatric patients."], "manufacturer_name": ["A-S Medication Solutions"], "substance_name": ["DULAGLUTIDE"], "effective_time": "20230805", "product_ndc": ["50090-6571"], "brand_name": ["TRULICITY"]}

Atropine Sulfate Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and C max by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2 to 4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid.

GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-IV and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single-dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) liraglutide on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single-dose of liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. figure-2 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single-dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single-dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single-dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide in the pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5-6) to severe (Child Pugh score >9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single-dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single-dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single-dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. Acetaminophen Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single-dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single-dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single-dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide-treated patients (1104 of 2501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] and 102/1104 (9%) of liraglutide-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 11 out of the 1247 (0.9%) adult liraglutide-treated patients with antibody measurements. Of the 11 adult liraglutide-treated patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies, none were observed to develop neutralizing antibodies to liraglutide, and 5 patients (0.4%) developed cross-reacting antibodies against native GLP-1. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ], anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide treated patients at week 53. None of the 5 patients had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1 or had neutralizing antibodies."], "manufacturer_name": ["A-S Medication Solutions"], "substance_name": ["LIRAGLUTIDE"], "effective_time": "20250130", "product_ndc": ["50090-7501"], "brand_name": ["Liraglutide"]}

The rate of hemoglobin increase varies among patients and is dependent upon the dose of PROCRIT administered. For correction of anemia in hemodialysis patients, a greater biologic response is not observed at doses exceeding 300 Units/kg 3 times weekly. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In adult and pediatric patients with CKD, the elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of plasma erythropoietin after intravenous administration of PROCRIT ranged from 4 to 13 hours. After subcutaneous administration, C max was achieved within 5 to 24 hours. The t 1/2 in adult patients with serum creatinine greater than 3 mg/dL was similar between those not on dialysis and those maintained on dialysis. The pharmacokinetic data indicate no apparent difference in PROCRIT t 1/2 among adult patients above or below 65 years of age.

Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of leuprolide acetate for depot suspension 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate.

Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one-carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. The mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis, pJIA, and in psoriasis is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution After intravenous administration, the initial volume of distribution is approximately 0.18 L/kg (18% of body weight) and steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 0.4 L/to 0.8 L/kg (40% to 80% of body weight). Methotrexate competes with reduced folates for active transport across cell membranes by means of a single carrier-mediated active transport process. At serum concentrations greater than 100 micromolar, passive diffusion becomes a major pathway by which effective intracellular concentrations can be achieved. Methotrexate in serum is approximately 50% protein bound. Methotrexate may be displaced from plasma albumin by various compounds, including sulfonamides, salicylates, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and phenytoin. Methotrexate does not penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in therapeutic amounts when given intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Elimination The terminal half-life reported for methotrexate is approximately 3 to 10 hours for patients receiving treatment for psoriasis, or rheumatoid arthritis or low-dose antineoplastic therapy (less than 30 mg/m 2 ). Following intravenous administration of high-dose methotrexate, the terminal half-life is 8 hours to 15 hours. Metabolism Methotrexate undergoes hepatic and intracellular metabolism to polyglutamated forms that can be converted back to methotrexate by hydrolase enzymes. These polyglutamates act as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthetase. Small amounts of methotrexate polyglutamates may remain in tissues for extended periods. The retention and prolonged drug action of these active metabolites vary among different cells, tissues, and tumors. Methotrexate undergoes minor metabolism to 7-hydroxymethotrexate, and accumulation may become significant following high dosages. The aqueous solubility of 7-hydroxymethotrexate is 3- to 5-fold lower than the solubility of methotrexate. Excretion Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is dependent upon dosage and route of administration. With intravenous administration, 80% to 90% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. There is limited biliary excretion amounting to 10% or less of the administered dose. Enterohepatic recirculation of methotrexate has been proposed. Renal excretion occurs by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Nonlinear elimination due to saturation of renal tubular reabsorption has been observed in psoriatic patients at doses between 7.5 mg and 30 mg.

Desmopressin-Acetate"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively.

Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one-carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. The mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis, pJIA, and in psoriasis is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution After intravenous administration, the initial volume of distribution is approximately 0.18 L/kg (18% of body weight) and steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 0.4 L/to 0.8 L/kg (40% to 80% of body weight). Methotrexate competes with reduced folates for active transport across cell membranes by means of a single carrier-mediated active transport process. At serum concentrations greater than 100 micromolar, passive diffusion becomes a major pathway by which effective intracellular concentrations can be achieved. Methotrexate in serum is approximately 50% protein bound. Methotrexate may be displaced from plasma albumin by various compounds, including sulfonamides, salicylates, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and phenytoin. Methotrexate does not penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in therapeutic amounts when given intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Elimination The terminal half-life reported for methotrexate is approximately 3 to 10 hours for patients receiving treatment for psoriasis, or rheumatoid arthritis or low-dose antineoplastic therapy (less than 30 mg/m 2 ). Following intravenous administration of high-dose methotrexate, the terminal half-life is 8 hours to 15 hours. Metabolism Methotrexate undergoes hepatic and intracellular metabolism to polyglutamated forms that can be converted back to methotrexate by hydrolase enzymes. These polyglutamates act as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthetase. Small amounts of methotrexate polyglutamates may remain in tissues for extended periods. The retention and prolonged drug action of these active metabolites vary among different cells, tissues, and tumors. Methotrexate undergoes minor metabolism to 7-hydroxymethotrexate, and accumulation may become significant following high dosages. The aqueous solubility of 7-hydroxymethotrexate is 3- to 5-fold lower than the solubility of methotrexate. Excretion Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is dependent upon dosage and route of administration. With intravenous administration, 80% to 90% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. There is limited biliary excretion amounting to 10% or less of the administered dose. Enterohepatic recirculation of methotrexate has been proposed. Renal excretion occurs by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Nonlinear elimination due to saturation of renal tubular reabsorption has been observed in psoriatic patients at doses between 7.5 mg and 30 mg.

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro . Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following twice weekly administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 bortezomib doses, the maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (relative to baseline) in whole blood was observed five minutes after drug administration. Comparable maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was observed between 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses. Maximal inhibition ranged from 70% to 84% and from 73% to 83% for the 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 dose regimens, respectively. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses, the mean maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib (C max ) after the first dose (Day 1) were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively. When administered twice weekly, the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m 2 dose to patients with multiple myeloma, the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC last ) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The AUC last geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) was 0.99 (0.80 to 1.23). The C max after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/mL) was lower than after intravenous administration (223 ng/mL) with repeat dose administration. Distribution The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 L/m 2 following single- or repeat-dose administration of 1 mg/m 2 or 1.3 mg/m 2 to patients with multiple myeloma. The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively. Metabolism Bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized to several inactive metabolites in vitro via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. Excretion The pathways of elimination of bortezomib have not been characterized in humans. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were observed based on age, sex, or renal impairment (including patients administered bortezomib after dialysis).

SDF-1\u03b1 and CXCR4 are recognized to play a role in the trafficking and homing of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to the marrow compartment. Once in the marrow, stem cell CXCR4 can act to help anchor these cells to the marrow matrix, either directly via SDF-1\u03b1 or through the induction of other adhesion molecules. Treatment with plerixafor resulted in leukocytosis and elevations in circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells in mice, dogs and humans. CD34+ cells mobilized by plerixafor were capable of engraftment with long-term repopulating capacity up to one year in canine transplantation models. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Data on the fold increase in peripheral blood CD34+ cell count (cells/mcL) by apheresis day were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients with NHL and MM (Study 1 and Study 2, respectively). The fold increase in CD34+ cell count (cells/mcL) over the 24-hour period starting from the day prior to the first apheresis and ending the next morning just before the first apheresis is summarized in Table 3. During this 24-hour period, a single dose of Mozobil or placebo was administered 10 to 11 hours prior to apheresis.

In pharmacodynamic studies of Mozobil in conjunction with filgrastim in healthy volunteers, a sustained elevation in the peripheral blood CD34+ count was observed from 4 to 18 hours after plerixafor administration with a peak CD34+ count between 10 and 14 hours. QT/QTc Prolongation There is no indication of a QT/QTc prolonging effect of Mozobil in single doses up to 0.40 mg/kg. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 48 healthy subjects were administered a single subcutaneous dose of plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg and 0.40 mg/kg) and placebo. Peak concentrations for 0.40 mg/kg Mozobil were approximately 1.8-fold higher than the peak concentrations following the 0.24 mg/kg single subcutaneous dose. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The single-dose pharmacokinetics of plerixafor 0.24 mg/kg were evaluated in patients with NHL and MM following pretreatment with filgrastim (10 mcg/kg once daily for 4 consecutive days). Plerixafor exhibits linear kinetics between the 0.04 mg/kg to 0.24 mg/kg dose range. The pharmacokinetics of plerixafor was similar across clinical studies in healthy subjects who received plerixafor alone and NHL and MM patients who received plerixafor in combination with filgrastim. A population pharmacokinetic analysis incorporated plerixafor data from 63 subjects (NHL patients, MM patients, subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment, and healthy subjects) who received a single SC dose (0.04 mg/kg to 0.24 mg/kg) of plerixafor. A two-compartment disposition model with first order absorption and elimination was found to adequately describe the plerixafor concentration-time profile. Significant relationships between clearance and creatinine clearance (CL CR ), as well as between central volume of distribution and body weight were observed. The distribution half-life (t 1/2\u03b1 ) was estimated to be 0.3 hours and the terminal population half-life (t 1/2\u03b2 ) was 5.3 hours in patients with normal renal function. The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the mg/kg-based dosage results in an increased plerixafor exposure (AUC 0\u201324h ) with increasing body weight. In order to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of plerixafor following 0.24 mg/kg-based and fixed (20 mg) doses, a follow-up trial was conducted in patients with NHL (N=61) who were treated with 0.24 mg/kg or 20 mg of plerixafor. The trial was conducted in patients weighing 70 kg or less. The fixed 20 mg dose showed 1.43-fold higher exposure (AUC 0\u201310h ) than the 0.24 mg/kg dose (Table 4). The fixed 20 mg dose also showed numerically higher response rate (5.2% [60.0% vs 54.8%] based on the local lab data and 11.7% [63.3% vs 51.6%] based on the central lab data) in attaining the target of \u22655 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg than the mg/kg-based dose. However, the median time to reach \u22655 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg was 3 days for both treatment groups, and the safety profile between the groups was similar. Based on these results, further analysis was conducted by FDA reviewers and a body weight of 83 kg was selected as an appropriate cut-off point to transition patients from fixed to weight based dosing. Table 4: Systemic Exposure (AUC 0\u201310h ) Comparisons of Fixed and Weight-Based Regimens Regimen Geometric Mean AUC Fixed 20 mg (n=30) 3991.2 0.24 mg/kg (n=31) 2792.7 Ratio (90% CI) 1.43 (1.32,1.54) There is limited experience with the 0.24 mg/kg dose of plerixafor in patients weighing above 160 kg. Therefore, the dose should not exceed that of a 160 kg patient (i.e., 40 mg/day if CL CR is greater than 50 mL/min and 27 mg/day if CL CR is less than or equal to 50 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.3) ] . Absorption Peak plasma concentrations occurred at approximately 30 to 60 minutes after a SC dose. Distribution Plerixafor is bound to human plasma proteins up to 58%. The apparent volume of distribution of plerixafor in humans is 0.3 L/kg demonstrating that plerixafor is largely confined to, but not limited to, the extravascular fluid space. Metabolism The metabolism of plerixafor was evaluated with in vitro assays. Plerixafor is not metabolized as shown in assays using human liver microsomes or human primary hepatocytes and does not exhibit inhibitory activity in vitro towards the major drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4/5). In in vitro studies with human hepatocytes, plerixafor does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 enzymes. These findings suggest that plerixafor has a low potential for involvement in cytochrome P450-dependent drug-drug interactions. Elimination The major route of elimination of plerixafor is urinary. Following a 0.24 mg/kg dose in healthy volunteers with normal renal function, approximately 70% of the dose was excreted in the urine as the parent drug during the first 24 hours following administration. In studies with healthy subjects and patients, the terminal half-life in plasma ranges between 3 and 5 hours. At concentrations similar to what are seen clinically, plerixafor did not act as a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein in an in vitro study with MDCKII and MDCKII-MDR1 cell models. Special Populations Renal impairment Following a single 0.24 mg/kg SC dose, plerixafor clearance was reduced in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment and was positively correlated with CL CR . The mean AUC 0\u201324h of plerixafor in subjects with mild (CL CR 51\u201380 mL/min), moderate (CL CR 31\u201350 mL/min), and severe (CL CR <31 mL/min) renal impairment was 7%, 32%, and 39% higher than healthy subjects with normal renal function, respectively. Renal impairment had no effect on C max . A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated an increased exposure (AUC 0\u201324h ) in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment compared to patients with CL CR >50 mL/min. These results support a dose reduction of one-third in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CL CR \u226450 mL/min) in order to match the exposure in patients with normal renal function. The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the mg/kg-based dosage results in an increased plerixafor exposure (AUC 0\u201324h ) with increasing body weight; therefore, if CL CR is \u226450 mL/min the dose should not exceed 27 mg/day [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] .

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Liraglutide is an acylated human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-IV and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide injection lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) liraglutide on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2 Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single dose of liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide injection on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. Figure 2 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8-12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide injection is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6-8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide in the pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 \u2013 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with R enal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5-6) to severe (Child Pugh score > 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide (8-12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. Acetaminophen Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1,000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide injection or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide-treated patients (1,104 of 2,501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] and 102/1,104 (9%) of liraglutide-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide injection. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] , anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide treated patients at week 53.

It also binds with high affinity to serotonin 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , and 5-HT 2C receptors, noradrenaline \u03b1 2A , \u03b1 2B and \u03b1 1 receptors, and dopamine D 2L and D 3 receptors. The therapeutic activity of dihydroergotamine in migraine is generally attributed to the agonist effect at 5-HT 1D receptors. Two current theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT 1D receptor agonists in migraine. One theory suggests that activation of 5-HT 1D receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on arteriovenous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache. The alternative hypothesis suggests that activation of 5-HT 1D receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. In addition, dihydroergotamine possesses oxytocic properties. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Absolute bioavailability for the subcutaneous and intramuscular route have not been determined; however, no difference was observed in dihydroergotamine bioavailability from intramuscular and subcutaneous doses. Dihydroergotamine mesylate is poorly bioavailable following oral administration. Distribution Dihydroergotamine mesylate is 93% plasma protein bound. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 800 liters. Metabolism Four dihydroergotamine mesylate metabolites have been identified in human plasma following oral administration. The major metabolite, 8\u2032-\u03b2-hydroxydihydroergotamine, exhibits affinity equivalent to its parent for adrenergic and 5-HT receptors and demonstrates equivalent potency in several venoconstrictor activity models, in vivo and in vitro. The other metabolites, (i.e., dihydrolysergic acid, dihydrolysergic amide) and a metabolite formed by oxidative opening of the proline ring are of minor importance. Following nasal administration, total metabolites represent only 20% to 30% of plasma AUC. Quantitative pharmacokinetic characterization of the four metabolites has not been performed. Excretion The major excretory route of dihydroergotamine is via the bile in the feces. The total body clearance is 1.5 L/min which reflects mainly hepatic clearance. Only 6% to 7% of unchanged dihydroergotamine is excreted in the urine after intramuscular injection. The renal clearance (0.1 L/min) is unaffected by the route of dihydroergotamine administration. The decline of plasma dihydroergotamine after intramuscular or intravenous administration is multi-exponential with a terminal half-life of about 9 hours. Subpopulations No studies have been conducted on the effect of renal or hepatic impairment, gender, race, or ethnicity on dihydroergotamine pharmacokinetics.

Interactions Pharmacokinetic interactions have been reported in patients treated orally with other ergot alkaloids (e.g., increased levels of ergotamine) and macrolide antibiotics, principally troleandomycin, presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P4503A metabolism of the alkaloids by troleandomycin. Dihydroergotamine has also been shown to be an inhibitor of cytochrome P4503A catalyzed reactions and rare reports of ergotism have been obtained from patients treated with dihydroergotamine and macrolide antibiotics (e.g., troleandomycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), and in patients treated with dihydroergotamine and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P4503A metabolism of ergotamine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ).

In vitro and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that terbutaline exerts a preferential effect on beta 2 \u2011adrenergic receptors. While it is recognized that beta 2 -adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there is a population of beta 2 -receptors in the human heart, existing in a concentration between 10% to 50%. The precise function of these receptors has not been established (see WARNINGS ). Controlled clinical studies in patients given terbutaline subcutaneously have not revealed a preferential beta 2 -adrenergic effect. The pharmacologic effects of beta-adrenergic agonists, including terbutaline, are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic 3\u2019,5\u2019-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. Controlled clinical studies have shown that terbutaline sulfate injection relieves bronchospasm in acute and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by significantly increasing pulmonary flow rates (e.g., an increase of 15% or more in FEV 1 ). After subcutaneous administration of 0.25 mg of terbutaline sulfate injection, a measurable change in expiratory flow rate usually occurs within 5 minutes, and a clinically significant increase in FEV 1 occurs within 15 minutes.

The duration of clinically significant improvement is comparable to that observed with equimilligram doses of epinephrine.

Olezarsen is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, in vitro . Olezarsen distributes primarily to the liver and kidney after subcutaneous dosing. Elimination Olezarsen terminal elimination half-life is approximately 4 weeks. Metabolism Olezarsen is metabolized by endo- and exonucleases to short oligonucleotide fragments of varying sizes within the liver. Excretion Less than 1% of olezarsen administered dose is eliminated unchanged in urine within 24 hours. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of olezarsen were observed based on age (< 65 to \u2265 75 years), body weight, sex, race (White, Black or African American, Asian, Japanese, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander), mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR \u226530 to <90 mL/min) [CKD-EPI], or mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST, National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group criteria). The effect of severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min), end-stage renal disease, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN with any AST) on olezarsen pharmacokinetics is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies CYP450 Enzymes: Olezarsen is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP450 enzymes. Transporter Systems: Olezarsen is not a substrate or inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, BCRP, P-gp, and BSEP. Protein Binding: Olezarsen does not displace warfarin and ibuprofen from plasma protein binding sites. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8 to 12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin.

This interaction results in intracellular signal transduction and subsequent induction of transcription and translation of GH-dependent proteins including IGF-1, IGF BP-3 and acid-labile subunit. Somatropin has direct tissue and metabolic effects or mediated indirectly by IGF-1, including stimulation of chondrocyte differentiation, and proliferation, stimulation hepatic glucose output, protein synthesis and lipolysis. Somatropin stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with GHD as a result of effects on the growth plates (epiphyses) of long bones. The stimulation of skeletal growth increases linear growth rate (height velocity) in most somatropin-treated pediatric patients. Linear growth is facilitated in part by increased cellular protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Subcutaneous administration of a single dose of 4 mg NORDITROPIN in healthy subjects (n=26) with suppressed endogenous growth hormone results in an increased mean (SD) IGF-1 level from 190 (46) ng/mL predose to maximal level of 276 (49) ng/mL after approx. 24 hours. After 96 hours, the subjects displayed a mean (SD) IGF-1 concentration of 196 (41) ng/mL, comparable to the predose value. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption - Somatropin has been studied following subcutaneous and intravenous administration in adult healthy subjects and GHD patients. A single dose administration of 4 mg NORDITROPIN in healthy subjects (n=26) with suppressed endogenous growth hormone resulted in a mean (SD) C max of 34.9 (10.4) ng/mL after approximately 3.0 hours. After a 180-min IV infusion of NORDITROPIN (33 ng/kg/min) administered to GHD patients (n=9), a mean (SD) hGH steady state serum level of approximately 23.1 (15.0) ng/mL was reached at 150 min. After a SC dose of 0.024 mg/kg or 3 IU/m 2 given in the thigh to adult GHD patients (n=18), mean (SD) C max values of 13.8 (5.8) and 17.1 (10.0) ng/mL were observed for the 4 and 8 mg NORDITROPIN vials, respectively, at approximately 4 to 5 hr. post dose. The absolute bioavailability for NORDITROPIN after the SC route of administration is currently not known. Distribution \u2014 The mean (SD) apparent volume of distribution of somatropin after single dose subcutaneous administration of 4 mg NORDITROPIN in healthy subjects is 43.9 (14.9) L. Elimination Metabolism \u2014 Extensive metabolism studies have not been conducted. The metabolic fate of somatropin involves classical protein catabolism in both the liver and kidneys. Excretion \u2013 The mean apparent terminal T 1/2 values in healthy adult subjects (n=26) was 2.0 (0.5) hours. In GHD patients receiving 180-min IV infusion of NORDITROPIN (33 ng/kg/min), a mean clearance rate of approximately 2.3 (1.8) mL/min/kg or 139 (105) mL/min for hGH was observed. Following infusion, serum hGH levels had a biexponential decay with a terminal elimination half-life (T 1/2 ) of approximately 21.1 (5.1) min. The mean apparent terminal T 1/2 values in GHD patients receiving a SC dose of 0.024 mg/kg or 3 IU/m 2 was estimated to be approximately 7 to 10 hr. The longer half-life observed after subcutaneous administration is due to slow absorption from the injection site. Urinary excretion of intact somatropin has not been measured. Geriatric patients \u2014 The pharmacokinetics of somatropin have not been studied in patients greater than 65 years of age. Pediatric patients \u2014 The pharmacokinetics of somatropin in pediatric patients are similar to those of adults. Male and Female Patients \u2014 No gender-specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with somatropin. The available literature indicates that the pharmacokinetics of somatropin are similar in men and women. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment \u2014 No studies have been performed with somatropin. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.

Also, Naloxone can reverse the psychotomimetic and dysphoric effects of agonist-antagonists such as pentazocine. Naloxone is an essentially pure opioid antagonist, i.e., it does not possess the \"agonistic\" or morphine-like properties characteristic of other opioid antagonists. When administered in usual doses and in the absence of opioids or agonistic effects of other opioid antagonists, it exhibits essentially no pharmacologic activity. Naloxone has not been shown to produce tolerance or cause physical or psychological dependence. In the presence of physical dependence on opioids, naloxone will produce withdrawal symptoms. However, in the presence of opioid dependence, opiate withdrawal symptoms may appear within minutes of naloxone administration and will subside in about 2 hours. The severity and duration of the withdrawal syndrome are related to the dose of naloxone and to the degree and type of opioid dependence. While the mechanism of action of naloxone is not fully understood, in vitro evidence suggests that naloxone antagonizes opioid effects by competing for the mu, kappa, and sigma opiate receptor sites in the CNS, with the greatest affinity for the mu receptor. When naloxone hydrochloride is administered intravenously, the onset of action is generally apparent within two minutes; the onset of action is slightly less rapid when it is administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. The duration of action is dependent upon the dose and route of administration of naloxone hydrochloride. Intramuscular administration produces a more prolonged effect than intravenous administration. Since the duration of action of naloxone may be shorter than that of some opiates, the effects of the opiate may return as the effects of naloxone dissipates. The requirement for repeat doses of naloxone, however, will also be dependent upon the amount, type and route of administration of the opioid being antagonized. Adjunctive Use in Septic Shock Naloxone has been shown in some cases of septic shock to produce a rise in blood pressure that may last up to several hours; however this pressor response has not been demonstrated to improve patient survival. In some studies, treatment with naloxone in the setting of septic shock has been associated with adverse effects, including agitation, nausea and vomiting, pulmonary edema, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures. The decision to use naloxone in septic shock should be exercised with caution, particularly in patients who may have underlying pain or have previously received opioid therapy and may have developed opioid tolerance.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro . Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following twice weekly administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 bortezomib doses, the maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (relative to baseline) in whole blood was observed five minutes after drug administration. Comparable maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was observed between 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses. Maximal inhibition ranged from 70% to 84% and from 73% to 83% for the 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 dose regimens, respectively. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses, the mean maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib (C max ) after the first dose (Day 1) were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively. When administered twice weekly, the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m 2 dose to patients with multiple myeloma, the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC last ) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The AUC last geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) was 0.99 (0.80 to 1.23). The C max after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/mL) was lower than after intravenous administration (223 ng/mL) with repeat dose administration. Distribution The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 L/m 2 following single- or repeat-dose administration of 1 mg/m 2 or 1.3 mg/m 2 to patients with multiple myeloma. The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively. Metabolism Bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized to several inactive metabolites in vitro via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. Excretion The pathways of elimination of bortezomib have not been characterized in humans. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were observed based on age, sex, or renal impairment (including patients administered Bortezomib for Injection after dialysis). The effect of race on bortezomib pharmacokinetics is unknown. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following administration of bortezomib doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/m 2 , mild (total bilirubin \u22641\u00d7 ULN and AST >ULN, or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5\u00d7 ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment did not alter dose-normalized bortezomib AUC when compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Dose normalized mean bortezomib AUC increased by approximately 60% in patients with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3\u00d7 ULN and any AST) or severe (total bilirubin >3\u00d7 ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Lanreotide, the active component of Lanreotide Injection, is an octapeptide analog of natural somatostatin. The mechanism of action of lanreotide is believed to be similar to that of natural somatostatin. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Lanreotide has a high affinity for human somatostatin receptors (SSTR) 2 and 5 and a reduced binding affinity for human SSTR1, 3, and 4. Activity at human SSTR2 and 5 is the primary mechanism believed responsible for GH inhibition. Like somatostatin, lanreotide is an inhibitor of various endocrine, neuroendocrine, exocrine, and paracrine functions. The primary pharmacodynamic effect of lanreotide is a reduction of GH and/or IGF-1 levels enabling normalization of levels in acromegalic patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . In acromegalic patients, lanreotide reduces GH levels in a dose-dependent way. After a single injection of lanreotide, plasma GH levels fall rapidly and are maintained for at least 28 days. In Study 4, patients with carcinoid syndrome treated with lanreotide injection 120 mg every 4 weeks had reduced levels of urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) compared with placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )]. Lanreotide inhibits the basal secretion of motilin, gastric inhibitory peptide, and pancreatic polypeptide, but has no significant effect on the secretion of secretin. Lanreotide inhibits postprandial secretion of pancreatic polypeptide, gastrin, and cholecystokinin (CCK). In healthy subjects, lanreotide produces a reduction and a delay in postprandial insulin secretion, resulting in transient, mild glucose intolerance. Lanreotide inhibits meal-stimulated pancreatic secretions, and reduces duodenal bicarbonate and amylase concentrations, and produces a transient reduction in gastric acidity. Lanreotide has been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and bile secretion in healthy subjects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . In healthy subjects, lanreotide inhibits meal-induced increases in superior mesenteric artery and portal venous blood flow but has no effect on basal or meal-stimulated renal blood flow. Lanreotide has no effect on renal plasma flow or renal vascular resistance. However, a transient decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and filtration fraction has been observed after a single injection of lanreotide. In healthy subjects, non-significant reductions in glucagon levels were seen after lanreotide administration. In diabetic non-acromegalic subjects receiving a continuous infusion (21-day) of lanreotide, serum glucose concentrations were temporarily decreased by 20% to 30% after the start and end of the infusion. Serum glucose concentrations returned to normal levels within 24 hours. A significant decrease in insulin concentrations was recorded between baseline and Day 1 only [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2) ] . Lanreotide inhibits the nocturnal increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) seen in healthy subjects. Lanreotide reduces prolactin levels in acromegalic patients treated on a long-term basis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5. 4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Lanreotide Injection is thought to form a drug depot at the injection site due to the interaction of the formulation with physiological fluids. The most likely mechanism of drug release is a passive diffusion of the precipitated drug from the depot towards the surrounding tissues, followed by the absorption to the bloodstream. After a single, deep subcutaneous administration, the mean absolute bioavailability of lanreotide in healthy subjects was 73.4, 69.0, and 78.4% for the 60 mg, 90 mg, and 120 mg doses, respectively. Mean Cmax values ranged from 4.3 to 8.4 ng/mL during the first day. Single-dose linearity was demonstrated with respect to AUC and Cmax and showed high inter-subject variability. Lanreotide showed sustained release of lanreotide with a half-life of 23 to 30 days. Mean serum concentrations were > 1 ng/mL throughout 28 days at 90 mg and 120 mg and > 0.9 ng/mL at 60 mg. In studies evaluating excretion, <5% of lanreotide was excreted in urine and less than 0.5% was recovered unchanged in feces, indicative of some biliary excretion. Acromegaly In a repeat-dose administration pharmacokinetics (PK) study in acromegalic patients, rapid initial release was seen giving peak levels during the first day after administration. At doses of lanreotide between 60 and 120 mg, linear pharmacokinetics were observed in acromegalic patients. At steady state, mean Cmax values were 3.8 \u00b1 0.5, 5.7 \u00b1 1.7, and 7.7 \u00b1 2.5 ng/mL, increasing linearly with dose. The mean accumulation ratio index was 2.7, which is in line with the range of values for the half-life of lanreotide. The steady- state trough serum lanreotide concentrations in patients receiving lanreotide every 28 days were 1.8 \u00b1 0.3; 2.5 \u00b1 0.9 and 3.8 \u00b1 1.0 ng/mL at 60 mg, 90 mg, and 120 mg doses, respectively. A limited initial burst effect and a low peak-to-trough fluctuation (81% to 108%) of the serum concentration at the plateau were observed. For the same doses, similar values were obtained in clinical studies after at least four administrations (2.3 \u00b1 0.9, 3.2 \u00b1 1.1, and 4.0 \u00b1 1.4 ng/mL, respectively). Pharmacokinetic data from studies evaluating extended dosing use of lanreotide injection 120 mg demonstrated mean steady-state, Cmin values between 1.6 and 2.3 ng/mL for the 8- and 6-week treatment interval, respectively. Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors In patients with GEP-NETs treated with lanreotide 120 mg every 4 weeks, steady state concentrations were reached after 4 to 5 injections and the mean trough serum lanreotide concentrations at steady state ranged from 5.3 to 8.6 ng/mL. Specific Populations Lanreotide Injection has not been studied in specific populations. However, the pharmacokinetics of lanreotide in renal impaired, hepatic impaired, and geriatric subjects were evaluated after IV administration of lanreotide immediate release formulation (IRF) at 7 mcg/kg dose. Geriatric Patients Studies in healthy elderly subjects showed an 85% increase in half-life and a 65% increase in mean residence time (MRT) of lanreotide compared to those seen in healthy young subjects; however, there was no change in either AUC or Cmax of lanreotide in elderly as compared to healthy young subjects. Age has no effect on clearance of lanreotide based on population PK analysis in patients with GEP-NET which included 122 patients aged 65 to 85 years with neuroendocrine tumors. Patients with Renal Impairment An approximate 2-fold decrease in total serum clearance of lanreotide, with a consequent 2\u00adfold increase in half-life and AUC was observed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Mild (CLcr 60-89 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr 30-59 mL/min) renal impairment has no effect on clearance of lanreotide in patients with GEP-NET based on population PK analysis which included 106 patients with mild and 59 patients with moderate renal impairment treated with lanreotide. GEP-NET patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) were not studied. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, a 30% reduction in clearance of lanreotide was observed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. The effect of hepatic impairment on clearance of lanreotide has not been studied in patients with GEP-NET. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of Lanreotide Injection or of other lanreotide products. Acromegaly Laboratory investigations of acromegalic patients treated with lanreotide injection in clinical studies show that the percentage of patients with putative antibodies at any time point after treatment is low (less than 1% to 4% of patients in specific studies whose antibodies were tested). The antibodies did not appear to affect the efficacy or safety of lanreotide injection. GEP-NETs In Study 3, development of anti-lanreotide antibodies was assessed using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay. In patients with GEP-NETs receiving lanreotide injection, the incidence of anti-lanreotide antibodies was 4% (3 of 82) at 24 weeks, 10% (7 of 67) at 48 weeks, 11% (6 of 57) at 72 weeks, and 10% (8 of 84) at 96 weeks.

Isoproterenol relaxes almost all varieties of smooth muscle when the tone is high, but this action is most pronounced on bronchial and gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It prevents or relieves bronchoconstriction, but tolerance to this effect develops with overuse of the drug. In man, isoproterenol causes less hyperglycemia than does epinephrine. Isoproterenol and epinephrine are equally effective in stimulating the release of free fatty acids and energy production. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Isoproterenol is readily absorbed when given parenterally or as an aerosol. Elimination Isoproterenol is metabolized primarily in the liver and other tissues by COMT. Isoproterenol is a relatively poor substrate for MAO and is not taken up by sympathetic neurons to the same extent as are epinephrine and norepinephrine. The duration of action of isoproterenol may therefore be longer than that of epinephrine but is still brief."], "manufacturer_name": ["Nordic Pharma, Inc."], "substance_name": ["ISOPROTERENOL HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240620", "product_ndc": ["69918-731", "69918-735"], "brand_name": ["Isoproterenol Hydrochloride"]}

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro . Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following twice weekly administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 bortezomib doses, the maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (relative to baseline) in whole blood was observed five minutes after drug administration. Comparable maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was observed between 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses. Maximal inhibition ranged from 70% to 84% and from 73% to 83% for the 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 dose regimens, respectively. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses, the mean maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib (C max ) after the first dose (Day 1) were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively. When administered twice weekly, the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m 2 dose to patients with multiple myeloma, the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC last ) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The AUC last geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) was 0.99 (0.80 to 1.23). The C max after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/mL) was lower than after intravenous administration (223 ng/mL) with repeat dose administration. Distribution The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 L/m 2 following single- or repeat-dose administration of 1 mg/m 2 or 1.3 mg/m 2 to patients with multiple myeloma. The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively. Metabolism Bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized to several inactive metabolites in vitro via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. Excretion The pathways of elimination of bortezomib have not been characterized in humans. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were observed based on age, sex, or renal impairment (including patients administered Bortezomib for Injection after dialysis). The effect of race on bortezomib pharmacokinetics is unknown. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following administration of bortezomib doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/m 2 , mild (total bilirubin \u22641\u00d7 ULN and AST >ULN, or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5\u00d7 ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment did not alter dose-normalized bortezomib AUC when compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Dose normalized mean bortezomib AUC increased by approximately 60% in patients with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3\u00d7 ULN and any AST) or severe (total bilirubin >3\u00d7 ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinically significant differences in bortezomib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with dexamethasone (weak CYP3A4 inducer), omeprazole (strong CYP2C19 inhibitor), or melphalan in combination with prednisone. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor Coadministration with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased bortezomib exposure by 35%.

IL-12 and IL-23 are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation. In in vitro models, ustekinumab products were shown to disrupt IL-12 and IL-23 mediated signaling and cytokine cascades by disrupting the interaction of these cytokines with a shared cell-surface receptor chain, IL-12R\u03b21. The cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 have been implicated as important contributors to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. In animal models of colitis, genetic absence or antibody blockade of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, the target of ustekinumab products, was shown to be protective. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Plaque Psoriasis In a small exploratory trial, a decrease was observed in the expression of mRNA of its molecular targets IL-12 and IL-23 in lesional skin biopsies measured at baseline and up to two weeks post-treatment in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Ulcerative Colitis In both trial UC-1 (induction) and trial UC-2 (maintenance), a positive relationship was observed between exposure and rates of clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The response rate approached a plateau at the ustekinumab exposures associated with the recommended dosing regimen for maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (T max ) was 13.5 days and 7 days, respectively, after a single subcutaneous administration of 45 mg (N=22) and 90 mg (N=24) of ustekinumab. In healthy subjects (N=30), the median T max value (8.5 days) following a single subcutaneous administration of 90 mg of ustekinumab was comparable to that observed in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Following multiple subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. The mean (\u00b1SD) steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.69 \u00b1 0.69 mcg/mL for subjects less than or equal to 100 kg receiving a 45 mg dose and 0.74 \u00b1 0.78 mcg/mL for subjects greater than 100 kg receiving a 90 mg dose. There was no apparent accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 12 weeks. Following the recommended intravenous induction dose, mean \u00b1SD peak serum ustekinumab concentration was 125.2 \u00b1 33.6 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 129.1 \u00b1 27.6 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Starting at Week 8, the recommended subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 90 mg ustekinumab was administered every 8 weeks. Steady state ustekinumab concentration was achieved by the start of the second maintenance dose. There was no apparent accumulation in ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough concentration was 2.5 \u00b1 2.1 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 3.3 \u00b1 2.3 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis for 90 mg ustekinumab administered every 8 weeks. Distribution Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the volume of distribution of ustekinumab in the central compartment was 2.7 L (95% CI: 2.69, 2.78) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 3.0 L (95% CI: 2.96, 3.07) in subjects with ulcerative colitis. The total volume of distribution at steady-state was 4.6 L in subjects with Crohn's disease and 4.4 L in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Elimination The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life ranged from 14.9 \u00b1 4.6 to 45.6 \u00b1 80.2 days across all plaque psoriasis trials following subcutaneous administration. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of ustekinumab was 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.185, 0.197) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.179, 0.192) in subjects with ulcerative colitis with an estimated median terminal half-life of approximately 19 days for both IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) populations. These results indicate the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab were similar between subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Metabolism The metabolic pathway of ustekinumab products has not been characterized. As a human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody, ustekinumab products are expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Specific Populations Weight When given the same dose, subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis weighing more than 100 kg had lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with those subjects weighing 100 kg or less. The median trough serum concentrations of ustekinumab in subjects of higher weight (greater than 100 kg) in the 90 mg group were comparable to those in subjects of lower weight (100 kg or less) in the 45 mg group. Age: Geriatric Population A population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=106/1937 subjects with plaque psoriasis greater than or equal to 65 years old) was performed to evaluate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab. There were no apparent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) in subjects older than 65 years old. Age: Pediatric Population Following multiple recommended doses of ustekinumab in pediatric subjects 6 to 17 years of age with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. At Week 28, the mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.36 \u00b1 0.26 mcg/mL and 0.54 \u00b1 0.43 mcg/mL, respectively, in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age and pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age. Overall, the observed steady-state ustekinumab trough concentrations in pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis were within the range of those observed for adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and adult subjects with PsA after administration of ustekinumab. Drug Interaction Studies The effects of IL-12 or IL-23 on the regulation of CYP450 enzymes were evaluated in an in vitro study using human hepatocytes, which showed that IL-12 and/or IL-23 at levels of 10 ng/mL did not alter human CYP450 enzyme activities (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4). No clinically significant changes in exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), or midazolam (CYP3A substrate) were observed when used concomitantly with ustekinumab at the approved recommended dosage in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the clearance of ustekinumab was not impacted by concomitant MTX, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids, or prior exposure to a TNF blocker in subjects with psoriatic arthritis. In subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, population pharmacokinetic analyses did not indicate changes in ustekinumab clearance with concomitant use of corticosteroids or immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX); and serum ustekinumab concentrations were not impacted by concomitant use of these medications."], "manufacturer_name": ["Biocon Biologics Inc."], "substance_name": ["USTEKINUMAB"], "effective_time": "20241115", "product_ndc": ["83257-023", "83257-024", "83257-025", "83257-026"], "brand_name": ["YESINTEK"]}

In this study, the mean (SD) time to maximum effect of ADMELOG (measured by the peak rate of glucose infusion) was approximately 2.1 (0.8) hours. The mean (SD) area under the glucose infusion rate curves (measure of overall pharmacodynamic effect) and mean (SD) maximum glucose infusion rate were 1953.5 (547.3) mg/kg and 9.97 (2.37) mg/min/kg, respectively (see Figure 1 ).

Figure 1 Pharmacodynamics of AMELOG after Intravenous Administration The glucose lowering effect of intravenous administration of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, was tested in 21 patients with type 1 diabetes. For the study, the patients' usual doses of insulin were held, and blood glucose concentrations were allowed to reach a stable range of 200 to 260 mg/dL during a one to three-hour run-in phase. The run-in phase was followed by a 6-hour assessment phase. During the assessment phase, patients received intravenous infusion of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, at an initial infusion rate of 0.5 units/hour. The infusion rate could be adjusted at regular timed intervals to achieve and maintain blood glucose concentrations between 100 to 160 mg/dL.

Its octanol/water partition coefficient at pH 7.4 is 117. A solution (1:100) in water has a pH between 4.5 and 6.5. Methadone hydrochloride has the following structural formula: Methadone Hydrochloride Injection is a sterile injectable solution available in 20 mL multiple-dose vials. Each mL of the Methadone Hydrochloride Injection contains: 10 mg of methadone hydrochloride (equivalent to 8.95 mg of methadone free base), 5 mg of chlorobutanol, as a preservative, 9 mg of sodium chloride, as tonicity agent, and hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide as pH adjusters, in water for injection. The pH of the sterile injectable solution is between 3.0 to 6.5. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Methadone hydrochloride is a mu-agonist; a synthetic opioid analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine, the most prominent of which involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. The principal therapeutic uses for methadone are for analgesia and for detoxification or maintenance in opioid addiction. The methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe. Some data also indicate that methadone acts as an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The contribution of NMDA receptor antagonism to methadone's efficacy is unknown. Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Methadone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Methadone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Some NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to produce neurotoxic effects in animals. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Methadone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Methadone produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of methadone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing methadone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Methadone Hydrochloride Injection is intended for parenteral (intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular) administration. Methadone pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration have not been systematically studied and differences among the various parenteral routes have not been well characterized. As with many drugs, absorption into the systemic circulation may vary with subcutaneous and intramuscular administration. Distribution Methadone is a lipophilic drug and the steady state volume of distribution ranges between 2 L/kg to 6 L/kg. In plasma, methadone is predominantly bound to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein (85% to 90%). Methadone is secreted in saliva, breast milk, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord plasma. Elimination Metabolism Methadone is primarily metabolized by N-demethylation to an inactive metabolite, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidene (EDDP). Cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, are responsible for conversion of methadone to EDDP and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted mainly in urine. Excretion Elimination of methadone is mediated by extensive biotransformation, followed by renal and fecal excretion. After single intravenous dose administration the plasma clearance of methadone ranged between 3 L/h to 10 L/h and the terminal half-life (t \u00bd ) ranged between 8 to 59 hours. Methadone has been known to persist in the liver and other tissues. Slow release from the liver and other tissues may prolong the duration of methadone action despite low plasma concentrations. Specific Populations Use During Pregnancy There are no pharmacokinetic studies of parenteral methadone in pregnancy. The disposition of oral methadone has been studied in approximately 30 pregnant patients in 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters. Elimination of methadone was significantly changed in pregnancy. Total body clearance of methadone was increased in pregnant patients compared to the same patients postpartum or to non-pregnant opioid-dependent women. The terminal half-life of methadone is decreased during second and third trimesters. The decrease in plasma half-life and increased clearance of methadone resulting in lower methadone trough levels during pregnancy can lead to withdrawal symptoms in some pregnant patients. The dosage may need to be increased or the dosing interval decreased in pregnant patients receiving methadone (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Impairment Methadone pharmacokinetics have not been extensively evaluated in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Methadone is metabolized in the liver and patients with liver impairment may be at risk of accumulating methadone after multiple dosing. Renal Impairment Methadone pharmacokinetics have not been extensively evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. Unchanged methadone and its metabolites are excreted in urine to a variable degree. Methadone is a basic (pKa = 9.2) compound and the luminal pH of the urinary tract can affect its extraction from plasma. Urine acidification has been shown to increase renal elimination of methadone. Forced diuresis, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been established as beneficial for increasing methadone or metabolite elimination. Sex The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated for sex specificity. Race The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated for race specificity. Age Geriatric Population The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated in geriatric population. Pediatric Population The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated in pediatric population. Drug Interaction Studies Cytochrome P450 Interactions Methadone undergoes hepatic N-demethylation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, principally CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. Co-administration of methadone with CYP inducers may result in more rapid metabolism and potential for decreased effects of methadone, whereas administration with CYP inhibitors may reduce metabolism and potentiate methadone's effects. Although antiretroviral drugs such as efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, lopinavir+ritonavir combination are known to inhibit some CYPs, they are shown to reduce the plasma levels of methadone, possibly due to CYP induction activity (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Cytochrome P450 Inducers The following drug interactions were reported following co-administration of methadone with known inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes: Rifampin In patients well-stabilized on methadone, concomitant administration of rifampin resulted in a marked reduction in serum methadone levels and a concurrent appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Phenytoin In a pharmacokinetic study with patients on methadone maintenance therapy, phenytoin administration (250 mg twice daily initially for 1 day followed by 300 mg daily for 3 to 4 days) resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in methadone exposure and withdrawal symptoms occurred concurrently. Upon discontinuation of phenytoin, the incidence of withdrawal symptoms decreased and methadone exposure increased to a level comparable to that prior to phenytoin administration. St. John's Wort, Phenobarbital, Carbamazepine Administration of methadone with other CYP3A4 inducers may result in withdrawal symptoms. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors Voriconazole Voriconazole can inhibit the activity of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Repeat dose administration of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 4 days) increased the peak plasma concentration (C max ) and AUC of (R)-methadone by 31% and 47%, respectively, in subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (30 mg to 100 mg daily. The C max and AUC of (S)-methadone increased by 65% and 103%, respectively. Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during co-administration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Antiretroviral Drugs Although antiretroviral drugs such as efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, telaprevir, lopinavir+ritonavir combination are known to inhibit some CYPs, they are shown to reduce the plasma levels of methadone, possibly due to CYP induction activity. Abacavir, amprenavir, darunavir+ritonavir, efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, telaprevir, lopinavir+ritonavir, saquinavir+ritonavir, tipranvir+ritonavir combination Co-administration of these anti-retroviral agents resulted in increased clearance or decreased plasma levels of methadone (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Didanosine and Stavudine Methadone decreased the AUC and peak levels for didanosine and stavudine, with a more significant decrease for didanosine. Methadone disposition was not substantially altered (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Zidovudine Methadone increased the AUC of zidovudine which could result in toxic effects (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Pregnancy There are no pharmacokinetic studies of parenteral methadone in pregnancy. The disposition of oral methadone has been studied in approximately 30 pregnant patients in 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters. Elimination of methadone was significantly changed in pregnancy. Total body clearance of methadone was increased in pregnant patients compared to the same patients postpartum or to non-pregnant opioid-dependent women. The terminal half-life of methadone is decreased during second and third trimesters. The decrease in plasma half-life and increased clearance of methadone resulting in lower methadone trough levels during pregnancy can lead to withdrawal symptoms in some pregnant patients.

Fig. 1 - Structural Formula of Insulin Aspart"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including NOVOLOG is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of NOVOLOG After Subcutaneous Administration The pharmacodynamic profile of NOVOLOG given subcutaneously in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes is shown in Figure 2. The maximum glucose-lowering effect of NOVOLOG occurred between 1 and 3 hours after subcutaneous injection (0.15 units/kg). The duration of action for NOVOLOG is 3 to 5 hours. The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs such as NOVOLOG may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual. The parameters of NOVOLOG activity (time of onset, peak time and duration) as designated in Figure 2 should be considered only as general guidelines. The rate of insulin absorption and onset of activity is affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Figure 2. Serial mean serum glucose collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of NOVOLOG (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Pharmacodynamics of NOVOLOG After Intravenous Administration A double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover study in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes demonstrated that intravenous infusion of NOVOLOG resulted in a blood glucose profile that was similar to that after intravenous infusion with regular human insulin. NOVOLOG or human insulin was infused until the patient\u2019s blood glucose decreased to 36 mg/dL, or until the patient demonstrated signs of hypoglycemia (rise in heart rate and onset of sweating), defined as the time of autonomic reaction (R) (see Figure 3). Figure 3. Mean blood glucose profiles following intravenous infusion of NOVOLOG (hatched curve) and regular human insulin (solid curve) in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes. R represents the time of autonomic reaction. Figure 2 Fig. 3 - Pharmacodynamics Graph - Time of Autonomic Reaction 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous administration of NOVOLOG is presented below. Absorption and Bioavailability In studies in healthy volunteers (total n=107) and patients with type 1 diabetes (total n=40), the median time to maximum concentration of NOVOLOG in these trials was 40 to 50 minutes versus 80 to 120 minutes, for regular human insulin respectively. The relative bioavailability of NOVOLOG (0.15 units/kg) compared to regular human insulin indicates that the two insulins are absorbed to a similar extent. In a clinical trial in patients with type 1 diabetes, NOVOLOG and regular human insulin, both administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 units/kg body weight, reached mean maximum concentrations of 82 and 36 mU/L , respectively. Distribution Insulin aspart has a low binding affinity to plasma proteins (<10%), similar to that seen with regular human insulin. Figure 4. Serial mean serum free insulin concentration collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of NOVOLOG (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Metabolism and Elimination In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study 17 healthy Caucasian male subjects between 18 and 40 years of age received an intravenous infusion of either NOVOLOG or regular human insulin at 1.5 mU/kg/min for 120 minutes. The mean insulin clearance was similar for the two groups with mean values of 1.2 L/h/kg for the NOVOLOG group and 1.2 L/h/kg for the regular human insulin group. After subcutaneous administration in normal male volunteers (n=24), NOVOLOG was eliminated with an average apparent half-life of 81 minutes. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients - The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of NOVOLOG and regular human insulin were evaluated in a single dose study in 18 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in 2 age groups: 6-12 years, n=9 and 13-17 years (Tanner grade \u2265 2), n=9. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in both age groups between NOVOLOG and regular human insulin were similar to those in healthy adult subjects and adults with type 1 diabetes. Geriatric Patients : The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of NOVOLOG and regular human insulin were investigated in a single dose study in 18 subjects with type 2 diabetes who were \u2265 65 years of age. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes between NOVOLOG and regular human insulin were similar to those in younger adults. Male and Female Patients : In healthy volunteers given a single subcutaneous dose of NOVOLOG 0.06 units/kg, no difference in insulin aspart levels was seen between males and females based on comparison of AUC (0-10h) or C max . Obese Patients : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.1 units/kg NOVOLOG was administered in a study of 23 patients with type 1 diabetes and a wide range of body mass index (BMI, 22-39 kg/m 2 ). The pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC and C max , of NOVOLOG were generally unaffected by BMI in the different groups \u2013 BMI 19-23 kg/m 2 (n=4); BMI 23-27 kg/m 2 (n=7); BMI 27-32 kg/m 2 (n=6) and BMI >32 kg/m 2 (n=6). Clearance of NOVOLOG was reduced by 28% in patients with BMI >32 kg/m 2 compared to patients with BMI <23 kg/m 2 . Patients with Renal Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.08 units/kg NOVOLOG was administered in a study to subjects with either normal renal function (n=6) creatinine clearance (CLcr) (> 80 ml/min) or mild (n=7; CLcr = 50-80 ml/min), moderate (n=3; CLcr = 30-50 ml/min) or severe (but not requiring hemodialysis) (n=2; CLcr = <30 ml/min) renal impairment. In this study, there was no apparent effect of creatinine clearance values on AUC and C max of NOVOLOG. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.06 units/kg NOVOLOG was administered in an open-label, single-dose study of 24 subjects (n=6/group) with different degree of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate and severe) having Child-Pugh Scores ranging from 0 (healthy volunteers) to 12 (severe hepatic impairment). In this study, there was no correlation between the degree of hepatic impairment and any NOVOLOG pharmacokinetic parameter.

{"indications_and_usage": ["1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nutropin AQ is a recombinant human growth hormone indicated for: Pediatric Patients : Treatment of children with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency (GHD), idiopathic short stature (ISS), Turner syndrome (TS), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) up to the time of renal transplantation ( 1.1 ). Adult Patients: Treatment of adults with either childhood-onset or adult-onset GHD ( 1.2 ). 1.1 Pediatric Patients Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) - Nutropin AQ \u00ae is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone (GH). Growth Failure Secondary to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) - Nutropin AQ is indicated for the treatment of growth failure associated with CKD up to the time of renal transplantation. Nutropin AQ therapy should be used in conjunction with optimal management of CKD. Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) - Nutropin AQ is indicated for the treatment of ISS, also called non-GHD short stature, defined by height SDS \u2264 \u20132.25, and associated with growth rates unlikely to permit attainment of adult height in the normal range, in pediatric patients whose epiphyses are not closed and for whom diagnostic evaluation excludes other causes associated with short stature that should be observed or treated by other means. Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome (TS) - Nutropin AQ is indicated for the treatment of short stature associated with TS. 1.2 Adult Patients Nutropin AQ is indicated for the replacement of endogenous GH in adults with GHD who meet either of the following two criteria: Adult Onset : Patients who have GHD, either alone or associated with multiple hormone deficiencies (hypopituitarism), as a result of pituitary disease, hypothalamic disease, surgery, radiation therapy, or trauma; or Childhood Onset : Patients who were GH deficient during childhood as a result of congenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic causes. Patients who were treated with somatropin for GHD in childhood and whose epiphyses are closed should be reevaluated before continuation of somatropin therapy at the reduced dose level recommended for GH deficient adults. According to current standards, confirmation of the diagnosis of adult GHD in both groups involves an appropriate GH provocative test with two exceptions: (1) patients with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies due to organic disease; and (2) patients with congenital/genetic GHD."], "generic_name": ["SOMATROPIN"], "id": "1c3d22f8-5624-4cbe-84a2-ad20d83d3e95", "route": ["SUBCUTANEOUS"], "description": ["11 DESCRIPTION Nutropin AQ (somatropin) injection, for subcutaneous use is a human growth hormone (hGH) produced by recombinant DNA technology. Nutropin AQ has 191 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 22,125 daltons. The amino acid sequence of the product is identical to that of pituitary-derived hGH. Nutropin AQ may contain not more than fifteen percent deamidated GH at expiration. The deamidated form of GH has been extensively characterized and has been shown to be safe and fully active. Nutropin AQ is a sterile liquid intended for subcutaneous administration. The product is nearly isotonic at a concentration of 5 mg of GH per mL and has a pH of approximately 6.0. Each pen cartridge or NuSpin contain either 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg of somatropin formulated in 17.4 mg sodium chloride, 5 mg phenol, 4 mg polysorbate 20, and 10 mM sodium citrate [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] ."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Somatropin (as well as endogenous growth hormone) binds to dimeric growth hormone receptors located within the cell membranes of target tissue cells resulting in intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects. Some of these pharmacodynamic effects are primarily mediated by insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) produced in the liver and also locally (e.g., skeletal growth, protein synthesis), while others are primarily a consequence of the direct effects of somatropin (e.g., lipolysis) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In vitro and in vivo preclinical and clinical testing have demonstrated that Nutropin AQ is therapeutically equivalent to pituitary-derived hGH. Pediatric patients who lack adequate endogenous growth hormone (GH) secretion, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and patients with Turner syndrome (TS) that were treated with Nutropin AQ or Nutropin resulted in an increase in growth rate and an increase in IGF-1 levels similar to that seen with pituitary-derived hGH. Tissue Growth A) Skeletal Growth : Nutropin AQ stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with growth failure due to a lack of adequate secretion of endogenous GH or secondary to CKD and in patients with TS. Skeletal growth is accomplished at the epiphyseal plates at the ends of a growing bone. Growth and metabolism of epiphyseal plate cells are directly stimulated by GH and one of its mediators, IGF-I. Serum levels of IGF-I are low in children and adolescents who are GHD, but increase during treatment with somatropin. In pediatric patients, new bone is formed at the epiphyses in response to GH and IGF-I. This results in linear growth until these growth plates fuse at the end of puberty. B) Cell Growth : Treatment with somatropin results in an increase in both the number and the size of skeletal muscle cells. C) Organ Growth : GH influences the size of internal organs, including kidneys, and increases red cell mass. Treatment of hypophysectomized or genetic dwarf rats with somatropin results in organ growth that is proportional to the overall body growth. In normal rats subjected to nephrectomy-induced uremia, somatropin promoted skeletal and body growth. Protein Metabolism Linear growth is facilitated in part by GH-stimulated protein synthesis. This is reflected by nitrogen retention as demonstrated by a decline in urinary nitrogen excretion and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) during somatropin therapy. Carbohydrate Metabolism GH is a modulator of carbohydrate metabolism. For example, patients with inadequate secretion of GH sometimes experience fasting hypoglycemia that is improved by treatment with Nutropin AQ. Somatropin therapy may decrease insulin sensitivity. Untreated patients with CKD and TS have an increased incidence of glucose intolerance. Administration of somatropin to adults or children resulted in increases in serum fasting and postprandial insulin levels, more commonly in overweight or obese individuals. In addition, mean fasting and postprandial glucose and hemoglobin A1C levels remained in the normal range. Lipid Metabolism In GHD patients, administration of somatropin resulted in lipid mobilization, reduction in body fat stores, increased plasma fatty acids, and decreased plasma cholesterol levels. Mineral Metabolism The retention of total body potassium in response to somatropin administration apparently results from cellular growth. Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus may increase slightly in patients with inadequate secretion of endogenous GH, CKD, or TS during Nutropin AQ therapy due to metabolic activity associated with bone growth as well as increased tubular reabsorption of phosphate by the kidney. Serum calcium is not significantly altered in these patients. Sodium retention also occurs. Adults with childhood-onset GHD show low bone mineral density (BMD). Nutropin AQ therapy results in increases in serum alkaline phosphatase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Connective Tissue Metabolism GH stimulates the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate and collagen as well as the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of somatropin after subcutaneous administration in healthy adult males has been determined to be 81 \u00b1 20%. The mean terminal t 1/2 after subcutaneous administration is significantly longer than that seen after intravenous administration (2.1 \u00b1 0.43 hours vs. 19.5 \u00b1 3.1 minutes) indicating that the subcutaneous absorption of the compound is slow and rate-limiting. Distribution Animal studies with somatropin showed that GH localizes to highly perfused organs, particularly the liver and kidney. The volume of distribution at steady state for somatropin in healthy adult males is about 50 mL/kg body weight, approximating the serum volume. Metabolism Both the liver and kidney have been shown to be important metabolizing organs for GH. Animal studies suggest that the kidney is the dominant organ of clearance. GH is filtered at the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the proximal tubules. It is then cleaved within renal cells into its constituent amino acids, which return to the systemic circulation. Elimination The mean terminal t 1/2 after intravenous administration of somatropin in healthy adult males is estimated to be 19.5 \u00b1 3.1 minutes. Clearance of rhGH after intravenous administration in healthy adults and children is reported to be in the range of 116\u2013174 mL/hr/kg. Bioequivalence of Formulations Nutropin AQ has been determined to be bioequivalent to Nutropin based on the statistical evaluation of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C max ). Special Populations Pediatric: Available literature data suggests that somatropin clearances are similar in adults and children. Geriatrics : Limited published data suggest that the plasma clearance and average steady-state plasma concentration of somatropin may not be different between young and elderly patients. Race: Reported values for half-lives for endogenous GH in normal adult black males are not different from observed values for normal adult white males. No data for other races are available. Growth Hormone Deficiency: Reported values for clearance of somatropin in adults and children with GHD range 138\u2013245 mL/hr/kg and are similar to those observed in healthy adults and children. Mean terminal t 1/2 values following intravenous and subcutaneous administration in adult and pediatric GHD patients are also similar to those observed in healthy adult males. Chronic Kidney Disease : Children and adults with CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) tend to have decreased clearance compared to normals. In a study with six pediatric patients 7 to 11 years of age, the clearance of Nutropin was reduced by 21.5% and 22.6% after the intravenous infusion and subcutaneous injection, respectively, of 0.05 mg/kg of Nutropin compared to normal healthy adults. Endogenous GH production may also increase in some individuals with ESRD. However, no somatropin accumulation has been reported in children with CKD or ESRD dosed with current regimens. Turner Syndrome : No pharmacokinetic data are available for exogenously administered somatropin. However, reported half-lives, absorption, and elimination rates for endogenous GH in this population are similar to the ranges observed for normal subjects and GHD populations. Hepatic Insufficiency: A reduction in somatropin clearance has been noted in patients with severe liver dysfunction. The clinical significance of this decrease is unknown. Gender: No gender-specific pharmacokinetic studies have been done with Nutropin AQ. The available literature indicates that the pharmacokinetics of somatropin are similar in men and women.

Insulin and its analog lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A euglycemic clamp study described below assessed glucose utilization after subcutaneous dosing of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in healthy subjects (n = 24). Following a 0.3 units/kg single subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, the onset of action is between 10-20 minutes and the mean \u00b1 SD time to peak activity is 2.7 hr \u00b1 0.9 hr.

Pharmacodynamic Activity Profile of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in healthy subjects after a single 0.3 units/kg subcutaneous dose Figure 2 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The single substitution of the amino acid proline with aspartic acid at position B28 in insulin aspart reduces the molecule\u2019s tendency to form hexamers as observed with regular human insulin. The rapid absorption characteristics of insulin aspart are maintained by Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Absorption and Bioavailability The 30% insulin aspart in the soluble component of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is absorbed rapidly from the subcutaneous layer. The remaining 70% is in crystalline form as insulin aspart protamine which has a prolonged absorption profile after subcutaneous injection. The relative bioavailability of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart compared to insulin aspart indicates that the insulins are absorbed to similar extent.

Extract of mixed short-giant ragweed has the same appearance as short ragweed pollen extract and contains the same chemical ingredients. It is prepared from equal gram weights of the pollens of Ambrosia elatior and Ambrosia trifida . STANDARDIZATION - The potency of ragweed pollen extract is based on antigen E, a protein component which is believed to be the most important allergen of short ragweed pollen. Extracts of short ragweed pollen sold in the U.S. must have a minimum antigen E content of 67.5 units per ml for a 1:20 w/v concentrate. Extracts of mixed short-giant ragweed must have a minimum antigen E content of 33.75 units/ml for a 1:20 w/v concentrate. The importance of antigen E in ragweed allergy is based on the following observations: In vitro studies with antigen E have shown that it is capable of causing histamine release from peripheral leukocytes of ragweed sensitive persons 1 . The antigen E content of short ragweed pollen extract has been found to correlate with extract potency when measured by skin test response in persons allergic to short ragweed pollen 2 .

GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-IV and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single-dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) liraglutide on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single-dose of liraglutide 7.5 mcg/kg (~0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. figure-2 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single-dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single-dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single-dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide in the pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5-6) to severe (Child Pugh score >9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of liraglutide (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single-dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single-dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single-dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. Acetaminophen Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single-dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median T max was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single-dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median T max did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single-dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide increased the levonorgestrel AUC 0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide delayed T max for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide-treated patients (1104 of 2501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] and 102/1104 (9%) of liraglutide-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 11 out of the 1247 (0.9%) adult liraglutide-treated patients with antibody measurements. Of the 11 adult liraglutide-treated patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies, none were observed to develop neutralizing antibodies to liraglutide, and 5 patients (0.4%) developed cross-reacting antibodies against native GLP-1. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ], anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide treated patients at week 53.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L.

Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations.

One mL (4 mcg) of Desmopressin Acetate Injection(desmopressin acetate) solution has an antidiuretic activity of about 16 IU; 1 mcg of Desmopressin Acetate Injection is equivalent to 4 IU. Desmopressin Acetate Injection has been shown to be more potent than arginine vasopressin in increasing plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. Dose-response studies were performed in healthy persons, using doses of 0.1 to 0.4 mcg/kg body weight, infused over a 10-minute period. Maximal dose response occurred at 0.3 to 0.4 mcg/kg. The response to Desmopressin Acetate Injection of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent of initial concentrations obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg body weight. The increase is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The factor VIII related antigen and ristocetin cofactor activity were also increased to a smaller degree, but still are dose-dependent. 1. The biphasic half-lives of Desmopressin Acetate Injection were 7.8 and 75.5 minutes for the fast and slow phases, respectively, compared with 2.5 and 14.5 minutes for lysine vasopressin, another form of the hormone. As a result, Desmopressin Acetate Injection provides a prompt onset of antidiuretic action with a long duration after each administration. 2. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to Desmopressin Acetate Injection has resulted in a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 3. When administered by injection, Desmopressin Acetate Injection has an antidiuretic effect about ten times that of an equivalent dose administered intranasally. 4. The bioavailability of the subcutaneous route of administration was determined qualitatively using urine output data. The exact fraction of drug absorbed by that route of administration has not been quantitatively determined. 5. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of Desmopressin Acetate Injection infused over 10 minutes. 6. Plasminogen activator activity increases rapidly after Desmopressin Acetate Injection infusion, but there has been no clinically significant fibrinolysis in patients treated with Desmopressin Acetate Injection. 7. The effect of repeated Desmopressin Acetate Injection administration when doses were given every 12 to 24 hours has generally shown a gradual diminution of the factor VIII activity increase noted with a single dose. The initial response is reproducible in any particular patient if there are 2 or 3 days between administrations.

In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor added to bupivacaine to slow absorption into the general circulation and thus prolong maintenance of an active tissue concentration. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic absorption of bupivacaine produces effects on the cardiovascular system and CNS. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. These cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Following systemic absorption, bupivacaine can produce CNS stimulation, CNS depression, or both. Apparent central stimulation is manifested as restlessness, tremors, and shivering, progressing to convulsions, followed by CNS depression and coma progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest. However, bupivacaine has a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited state. The duration of local anesthesia after administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is longer than that observed after administration of other commonly used short-acting local anesthetics. There appears to be period of analgesia that persists after the resolution of the block and return of sensation. The onset of action following dental injections is usually 2 to 10 minutes and may last up to 7 hours. The duration of anesthetic effect is prolonged by the addition of epinephrine 1:200,000. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection do not correlate with local efficacy. Absorption The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000) usually reduces the rate of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine, permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and sometimes prolonging the duration of action [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After injection of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next three to six hours. Distribution Bupivacaine appears to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of bupivacaine appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity (95%) has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4). The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, bupivacaine is distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profile of bupivacaine after direct intravenous injection (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is not approved for intravenous use) suggest a three-compartment open model. The first compartment is represented by the rapid intravascular distribution of the drug. The second compartment represents the equilibration of the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as the brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and liver. The third compartment represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly perfused tissues, such as muscle and fat. Elimination The half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours. Metabolism Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine. The elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely upon the availability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized. Excretion The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Elderly patients exhibited higher peak plasma concentrations than younger patients following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection. The total plasma clearance was decreased in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic disease. Patients with hepatic disease, especially those with severe hepatic disease, may be more susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local anesthetics [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of renal disease, factors affecting urinary pH, and renal blood flow [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.7) ] .", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt retaining properties, are used in replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are used primarily for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine hydrochloride stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine hydrochloride is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine hydrochloride is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine hydrochloride crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine hydrochloride. Approximately 90% of lidocaine hydrochloride administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine hydrochloride following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine hydrochloride required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl\u203e) ions. These ions are normal constituents of the body fluids (principally extracellular) and are essential for maintaining electrolyte balance.

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro . Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following twice weekly administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 bortezomib doses, the maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (relative to baseline) in whole blood was observed five minutes after drug administration. Comparable maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was observed between 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses. Maximal inhibition ranged from 70% to 84% and from 73% to 83% for the 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 dose regimens, respectively. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses, the mean maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib (C max ) after the first dose (Day 1) were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively. When administered twice weekly, the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m 2 dose to patients with multiple myeloma, the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC last ) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The AUC last geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) was 0.99 (0.80 to 1.23). The C max after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/mL) was lower than after intravenous administration (223 ng/mL) with repeat dose administration. Distribution The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 L/m 2 following single- or repeat-dose administration of 1 mg/m 2 or 1.3 mg/m 2 to patients with multiple myeloma. The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively. Metabolism Bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized to several inactive metabolites in vitro via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. Excretion The pathways of elimination of bortezomib have not been characterized in humans. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were observed based on age, sex, or renal impairment (including patients administered VELCADE after dialysis). The effect of race on bortezomib pharmacokinetics is unknown. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following administration of bortezomib doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/m 2 , mild (total bilirubin \u22641\u00d7 ULN and AST >ULN, or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5\u00d7 ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment did not alter dose-normalized bortezomib AUC when compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Dose normalized mean bortezomib AUC increased by approximately 60% in patients with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3\u00d7 ULN and any AST) or severe (total bilirubin >3\u00d7 ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinically significant differences in bortezomib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with dexamethasone (weak CYP3A4 inducer), omeprazole (strong CYP2C19 inhibitor), or melphalan in combination with prednisone. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor Coadministration with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased bortezomib exposure by 35%. Strong CYP3A4 Inducer Coadministration with rifampin (strong CYP3A4 inducer) decreased bortezomib exposure by approximately 45%.

Through the inhibition of TFPI, concizumab-mtci acts to enhance FXa production during the initiation phase of coagulation which leads to improved thrombin generation and clot formation with the goal of achieving hemostasis in patients with Hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. The effect of concizumab-mtci is not influenced by the presence of inhibitory antibodies to FVIII or FIX. There is no structural relationship or sequence homology between concizumab-mtci and FVIII or FIX and, as such, treatment with concizumab-mtci does not induce or enhance the development of direct inhibitors to FVIII or FIX. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increasing concizumab-mtci dose levels resulted in decreased levels of free TFPI (plasma TFPI not bound to concizumab-mtci) and increased duration of free TFPI suppression. Free TFPI plasma levels pre-dose decreased from a geometric mean (CV%) of 88.3 (20%) ng/mL at baseline to 10.7 (105%) ng/mL at week 24 in patients on Alhemo prophylaxis, while the geometric mean (CV%) was 76 (18%) ng/mL at week 24 for patients on no Alhemo prophylaxis. Mean thrombin peak within the range of normal plasma reflected that concizumab\u2011mtci re\u2010established thrombin generation capacity. Drug Interaction In vitro studies Additive and sometimes synergistic increase in thrombin peak as quantified in the thrombin generation assay has been observed in plasma from hemophilia patients who were on prophylactic treatment with concizumab-mtci with concomitant presence of rFVIII, rFIX or bypassing agents including rFVIIa and aPCC. Depending on concentrations of concizumab-mtci and hemostatic agents, the impact on thrombin peak ranged from being additive with all hemostatic agents to an extra 40% effect with rFVIIa, an extra 33% effect with aPCC, an extra 22% with rFVIII and less than 13% with rFIX. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Peak and trough geometric mean plasma concizumab-mtci concentrations at steady state are shown in Table 2 . Following a single Alhemo loading dose of 1 mg/kg, the steady state concentrations were reached around Day 4 and remained within a stable exposure range with daily maintenance doses. Concizumab-mtci AUC and C max increased with increasing dose in a greater than dose-proportional manner following subcutaneous administration. Table 2.

Absorption Concizumab-mtci time to maximum plasma concentration ranged from 8 hours to 99 hours (4.1 days) following a single Alhemo subcutaneous dose of 0.05 to 3 mg/kg in healthy and hemophilia subjects. Distribution Concizumab-mtci volume of distribution for a typical 70 kg patient is about 3 L. Elimination Concizumab-mtci is cleared via linear and non-linear mechanisms. Concizumab-mtci exhibited non-linear pharmacokinetics due to target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) which occurs when it forms concizumab-mtci/TFPI complex. Once the target becomes saturated, linear pathway (i.e., catabolism) dominates. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, 90% of concizumab-mtci is expected to be eliminated by the end of approximately 4 days after the last dose (time for 50% of drug to be eliminated is approximately 1 day). Metabolism Concizumab-mtci is expected to be metabolized into small peptides by catabolic pathways. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of concizumab-mtci were observed based on age (12 year to 79 years), race (White 62.9%, Asian 25%, Black 6%), hemophilia type (A vs B). No dedicated studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of renal or hepatic impairment. As concizumab-mtci is a monoclonal antibody, there is no expectation for concizumab-mtci exposures to be different in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Body weight The exposure of concizumab-mtci increased with increasing body weight (27 kg to 130.7 kg) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in the studies described below with the incidence of ADA in other studies, including those of concizumab-mtci or of other concizumab products. During the treatment period in 4 trials with a duration of 11-weeks, \u226576-weeks, \u226576-weeks, and \u226532-weeks, 47 out of the 185 treated patients (25.4%) developed anti\u2011concizumab\u2011mtci antibodies. Among the 47 patients who tested positive for ADA, 12 patients (25.5%) developed neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against concizumab-mtci. In 1 patient who developed NAb against concizumab-mtci, free TFPI levels were restored to baseline indicative of effectiveness likely being compromised. In the remaining 46 patients, there was no identified clinically significant effect of the antibodies on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, or effectiveness of concizumab-mtci. 12.7 Interference of Concizumab-mtci with Laboratory Tests In vitro studies No clinically significant interference with standard prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time assays or FVIII or FIX activity measurement using clot and chromogenic assays was observed with concizumab-mtci.

Absorbed vitamin B12 is transported via specific B12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses.

Plasma kallikrein is a protease that cleaves high-molecular-weight-kininogen (HMWK) to generate cleaved HMWK (cHMWK) and bradykinin, a potent vasodilator that increases vascular permeability resulting in swelling and pain associated with HAE. In patients with HAE due to C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency or dysfunction, normal regulation of plasma kallikrein activity is not present, which leads to uncontrolled increases in plasma kallikrein activity and results in angioedema attacks. Lanadelumab-flyo decreases plasma kallikrein activity to control excess bradykinin generation in patients with HAE. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In adult and pediatric (12 to less than 18 years) patients, concentration-dependent inhibition of plasma kallikrein, measured as reduction of cHMWK levels, was demonstrated after subcutaneous administration of TAKHZYRO 150 mg q4wks, 300 mg q4wks or 300 mg q2wks in patients with HAE. For pediatric patients 2 to less than 6 years (150 mg q4wks) and 6 to less than 12 years (150 mg q2wks), the observed mean percent change from baseline cHMWK levels was similar to that observed in adult and pediatric (12 to less than 18 years) patients (300 mg q2wks or 300 mg q4wks). Cardiac Electrophysiology TAKHZYRO did not prolong the QT/QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following subcutaneous administration, the pharmacokinetics of lanadelumab-flyo was approximately dose-proportional in the therapeutic dose range in patients with HAE (Table 2).

Following subcutaneous administration of TAKHZYRO, peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 days, and terminal elimination half-life is ~ 2 weeks. The anticipated time to reach steady state concentration was approximately 70 days.

Body weight was identified as an important covariate describing the variability of clearance and volume of distribution, resulting in higher exposure (AUC and C max ) in lighter patients. However, this difference is not considered to be clinically relevant and no dose adjustments are recommended for any of these demographics. Pediatric Population Based on population pharmacokinetics (PK) analyses, the geometric mean lanadelumab-flyo average concentration at steady state (C ave ) was approximately 25% higher following subcutaneous administration of TAKHZYRO 300 mg q2wks in pediatric patients 12 to less than 18 years of age than the mean C ave in adult patients under the same dosing regimen, due to lower body weight in pediatric patients. Lanadelumab-flyo exposures in pediatric patients 2 to less than 12 years of age receiving TAKHZYRO 150 mg q2wks or q4wks are comparable to those in adult patients receiving TAKHZYRO 300 mg q2wks. The geometric mean lanadelumab-flyo C ave was approximately 7% higher following subcutaneous administration of TAKHZYRO 150 mg q2wks in pediatric patients 6 to less than 12 years of age compared to the mean C ave in adult patients receiving 300 mg q2wks. The mean lanadelumab-flyo C ave was approximately 14% lower following subcutaneous administration of TAKHZYRO 150 mg q4wks in pediatric patients 2 to less than 6 years of age compared to the mean C ave in adult patients receiving 300 mg q2wks.

Concomitant medications The use of analgesic, antibacterial, antihistamine, anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic medications had no effect on clearance and volume of distribution of lanadelumab-flyo. For breakthrough HAE attacks, use of rescue medications such as plasma-derived and recombinant C1-INH, icatibant or ecallantide had no effects on clearance and volume of distribution of lanadelumab-flyo. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.

This leads to reduced circulating levels of neurotoxic intermediates aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), factors associated with attacks and other disease manifestations of AHP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamic effects of GIVLAARI were evaluated in chronic high excreters treated with 0.035 to 2.5 mg/kg single dose and AHP patients treated with 2.5 to 5 mg/kg once monthly and 2.5 to 5 mg/kg once quarterly dose via subcutaneous injection. Dose-dependent reduction in urinary ALAS1 mRNA, ALA and PBG levels was observed over the 0.035 to 5 mg/kg dose range (0.14 to 2-fold the approved recommended dosage). Median reductions from baseline in urinary ALA and PBG of 83.7% and 75.1%, respectively, were observed 14 days after the first dose of GIVLAARI 2.5 mg/kg once monthly in AHP patients. Maximal reductions in ALA and PBG levels were achieved around Month 3, with median reductions from baseline of 93.8% for ALA and 94.5% for PBG, and were sustained thereafter with repeated once monthly dosing. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of GIVLAARI on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study and the open-label extension in 94 patients. No large mean increase in QTc (i.e. >20 ms) was detected at the 2.5 mg/kg once monthly dose level. A dedicated thorough QT study has not been conducted with GIVLAARI. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of givosiran and its active metabolite [AS(N-1)3\u2032 givosiran] were evaluated following single and multiple dosing in chronic high excreter subjects and AHP patients as summarized in Table 2.

Active Metabolite The active metabolite, AS(N-1)3\u2032 givosiran, is equipotent to givosiran in plasma and the AUC 0-24 represents 45% of givosiran AUC, at the approved recommended givosiran dosage. Excretion Primary Pathway The dose recovered in urine was 5%-14% as givosiran and 4%-13% as AS(N-1)3\u2032 givosiran After single and multiple subcutaneous doses of givosiran 2.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg. . Specific Populations No clinically meaningful differences in givosiran pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (percent reduction in urinary ALA and PBG) were observed based on age (19 to 65 years), sex, race/ethnicity, mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR \u226515 to <89 mL/min/1.73m 2 estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula), and mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin \u22641\u00d7ULN and AST >1\u00d7ULN, or bilirubin >1\u00d7ULN to 1.5\u00d7ULN).The effect of end-stage renal disease (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), and moderate to severe hepatic impairment on givosiran pharmacokinetics is unknown.

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within one hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed Vitamin B 12 is transported via specific B 12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for Vitamin B 12 storage. Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of Vitamin B 12 , 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage. Gastrointestinal absorption of Vitamin B 12 depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of Vitamin B 12 prevents progression of neurologic damage. The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of Vitamin B 12 in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B 12 is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs). Vitamin B 12 is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and Vitamin B 12 enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses.

Decreased GO enzyme levels reduce the amount of available glyoxylate, a substrate for oxalate production. As the GO enzyme is upstream of the deficient alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) enzyme that causes PH1, the mechanism of action of lumasiran is independent of the underlying AGXT gene mutation. OXLUMO is not expected to be effective in primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2) or type 3 (PH3) because its mechanism of action does not affect the metabolic pathways causing hyperoxaluria in PH2 and PH3. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamic effects of OXLUMO have been evaluated in adult and pediatric patients with PH1 across a range of doses and dosing frequency. Dose-dependent reductions in urinary oxalate levels were observed, resulting in the selection of the recommended body weight-based loading and maintenance dosing regimens. With the recommended dosing regimens, onset of effect was observed within two weeks after the first dose and maximal reductions in urinary oxalate were observed by Month 2 and persisted with continued use of OXLUMO maintenance dosage [see Figures 1 and 2 in Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)] .

Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Icatibant is a competitive antagonist selective for the bradykinin B2 receptor, with an affinity similar to bradykinin. Hereditary angioedema is caused by an absence or dysfunction of C1-esterase-inhibitor, a key regulator of the Factor XII/kallikrein proteolytic cascade that leads to bradykinin production. Bradykinin is a vasodilator which is thought to be responsible for the characteristic HAE symptoms of localized swelling, inflammation, and pain. Icatibant inhibits bradykinin from binding the B2 receptor and thereby treats the clinical symptoms of an acute, episodic attack of HAE. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following bradykinin challenge, intravenous administration of icatibant injection caused dose and time-dependent inhibition of development of bradykinin-induced hypotension, vasodilation, and reflex tachycardia in healthy young subjects. Icatibant injection intravenous doses of 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg infused over 4 hours inhibited response to bradykinin challenge for 6 to 8 hours following completion of the infusion. Based on exposure-response analysis, a subcutaneous dose of 30 mg icatibant injection is predicted to be effective against bradykinin challenge for at least 6 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. The effect of icatibant injection 30 and 90 mg following a single subcutaneous injection on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) four-period crossover thorough QT study in 72 healthy subjects. In a study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on individual correction method (QTcI) was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern. The dose of 90 mg is adequate to represent the high exposure clinical scenario. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of icatibant injection has been characterized in studies using both intravenous and subcutaneous administration to healthy subjects and patients. The pharmacokinetic profile of icatibant injection in patients with HAE is similar to that in healthy subjects. The absolute bioavailability of icatibant injection following a 30 mg subcutaneous dose is approximately 97%. Following subcutaneous administration of a single 30 mg dose of icatibant injection to healthy subjects (N=96), a mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) maximum plasma concentration (C max ) of 974 \u00b1 280 ng/mL was observed after approximately 0.75 hours. The mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) after a single 30 mg dose was 2165 \u00b1 568 ng\u00b7hr/mL, with no evidence of accumulation of icatibant following three 30 mg doses administered 6 hours apart. Following subcutaneous administration, plasma clearance was 245 \u00b1 58 mL/min with a mean elimination half-life of 1.4 \u00b1 0.4 hours and volume of distribution at steady state (V ss ) of 29.0 \u00b1 8.7 L. Icatibant is extensively metabolized by proteolytic enzymes to inactive metabolites that are primarily excreted in the urine, with less than 10% of the dose eliminated as unchanged drug. Icatibant is not degraded by oxidative metabolic pathways, is not an inhibitor of major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes (CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and is not an inducer of CYP 1A2 and 3A4. Special populations Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetic parameters of icatibant injection were found to be generally comparable between healthy subjects (n=8) and mild to moderate (Child Pugh scores of 5 to 8) hepatic impaired patients (n=8) following a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day as continuous intravenous infusion over 3 days. In a separate study, icatibant injection clearance in subjects with a wide range of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh scores of 7 to 15) was similar to that in healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Renal Impairment Since renal clearance of icatibant is a minor eliminating pathway, renal impairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of icatibant injection and hence a formal renal impairment study was not conducted for icatibant injection. In 10 patients with hepatorenal syndrome (GFR 30-60 mL/min), clearance of icatibant injection was not dependent on renal function and therefore, did not show any observable differences in the plasma levels of icatibant or its metabolites compared to subjects with normal renal function. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Age and Gender Three 30 mg subcutaneous doses of icatibant injection administered every 6 hours were studied in young (18 to 45 years of age) and elderly (over 65 years of age) healthy male and female subjects. Following single-dose administration of 30 mg subcutaneous icatibant injection, elderly males and females showed approximately 2-fold higher AUC compared to young males and females, respectively. However, only minor differences (~12-14%) between C max of gender\u2013matched elderly and young subjects were observed. Older subjects tend to exhibit lower clearance compared to younger subjects and therefore higher systemic exposure. Gender effect on icatibant injection pharmacokinetics was also observed in addition to age effect. Clearance of icatibant injection is significantly correlated with bodyweight with lower clearance values noted for lower bodyweights. Hence, females with typically lower body weights compared to males exhibit lower clearance values, resulting in approximately 2-fold higher systemic exposure (both AUC and C max ) compared to males. Differences in efficacy and safety between elderly and younger patients and male and female patients have not been identified. Dose adjustment based on age and gender is not warranted. Drug Interactions Formal drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted with icatibant injection. Icatibant metabolism is not mediated by CYP450 enzymes. In vitro study did not show any significant inhibition and/or induction of drug metabolizing CYP450 enzymes; therefore, metabolic drug interactions between icatibant injection and CYP450 substrates, inhibitors and inducers are not expected."], "manufacturer_name": ["Cycle Pharmaceuticals Ltd-Uk"], "substance_name": ["ICATIBANT ACETATE"], "effective_time": "20240216", "product_ndc": ["70709-013"], "brand_name": ["SAJAZIR"]}

Following a 0.3 units/kg single subcutaneous dose of NOVOLOG MIX 70/30, the onset of action is between 10-20 minutes and the mean \u00b1 SD time to peak activity is 2.7 hr \u00b1 0.9 hr. The duration of action may be as long as 24 hours (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Pharmacodynamic Activity Profile of NOVOLOG MIX 70/30 in healthy subjects after a single 0.3 units/kg subcutaneous dose Graph showing glucose infusion rate for NovoLog Mix 0/30 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The single substitution of the amino acid proline with aspartic acid at position B28 in insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) reduces the molecule\u2019s tendency to form hexamers as observed with regular human insulin. The rapid absorption characteristics of NOVOLOG are maintained by NOVOLOG MIX 70/30. Absorption and Bioavailability The 30% insulin aspart in the soluble component of NOVOLOG MIX 70/30 is absorbed rapidly from the subcutaneous layer. The remaining 70% is in crystalline form as insulin aspart protamine which has a prolonged absorption profile after subcutaneous injection. The relative bioavailability of NOVOLOG MIX 70/30 compared to NOVOLOG indicates that the insulins are absorbed to similar extent. In a euglycemic clamp study in healthy subjects (n=24) after dosing with NOVOLOG MIX 70/30 (0.3 units/kg), a mean maximum serum concentration (C max ) of 61.3 \u00b1 20.1 milliunits/L was reached after 85 minutes. Serum insulin levels returned to baseline 16 to 20 hours after a subcutaneous dose of NOVOLOG MIX 70/30 (see Fig. 3 for pharmacokinetic profile). Figure 3.

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro . Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following twice weekly administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 bortezomib doses, the maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (relative to baseline) in whole blood was observed five minutes after drug administration. Comparable maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was observed between 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses. Maximal inhibition ranged from 70% to 84% and from 73% to 83% for the 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 dose regimens, respectively. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses, the mean maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib (C max ) after the first dose (Day 1) were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively. When administered twice weekly, the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m 2 dose to patients with multiple myeloma, the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC last ) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The AUC last geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) was 0.99 (0.80 to 1.23). The C max after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/mL) was lower than after intravenous administration (223 ng/mL) with repeat dose administration. Distribution The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 L/m 2 following single- or repeat-dose administration of 1 mg/m 2 or 1.3mg/m 2 to patients with multiple myeloma. The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg/m2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively. Metabolism Bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized to several inactive metabolites in vitro via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9.

Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years.

The T max or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection.

GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-IV and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide injection\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide injection lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide injection or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide injection 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) liraglutide injection on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner (Figure 2). Figure 2 Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single-Dose Liraglutide Injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Liraglutide injection lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single dose of liraglutide injection 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying Liraglutide injection causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which postprandial glucose appears in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of liraglutide injection on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. Liraglutide injection at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8 to 12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max ) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg liraglutide injection, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0-\u221e was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0-\u221e from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide injection 0.6 mg is approximately 13 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide injection is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide injection using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide injection in the pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide injection compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide injection provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5 to 6) to severe (Child Pugh score > 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide injection has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that Cmax of liraglutide injection (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; Cmax decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (Tmax) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; Cmax decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median Tmax was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide injection. Atorvastatin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38% and median Tmax was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide injection. Acetaminophen Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1,000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen Cmax was decreased by 31% and median Tmax was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin Cmax increased by 37% while median Tmax did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide injection lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide injection on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide injection increased the levonorgestrel AUC0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide injection delayed Tmax for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide injection and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide injection or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide injection-treated patients (1,104 of 2,501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] and 102/1,104 (9%) of liraglutide injection-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide injection-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide injection-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide injection. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide injection-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide injection-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide injection-treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide injection-treated patients at week 53. None of the 5 patients had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1 or had neutralizing antibodies. Figure 2"], "manufacturer_name": ["Hybio Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

GLP-1(7-37) represents <20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1. Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-IV and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Liraglutide injection\u2019s pharmacodynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as liraglutide injection lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide injection or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 38% lower after liraglutide injection 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) liraglutide injection on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner (Figure 2).

Elimination The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Metabolism During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Excretion Following a [ 3 H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6 to 8 days. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Pediatric Patients A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for liraglutide injection using data from 72 pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide injection in the pediatric patients was consistent with that in adults. Male and Female Patients Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight-adjusted clearance of liraglutide injection compared to males. Race or Ethnic Groups Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects. Body Weight Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of liraglutide injection provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 to 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Patients with Renal Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide injection were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with mild (Child Pugh score 5 to 6) to severe (Child Pugh score > 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions Liraglutide injection has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment, subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that Cmax of liraglutide injection (8 to 12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; Cmax decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (Tmax) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. The co-administration with liraglutide injection resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; Cmax decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median Tmax was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide injection. Atorvastatin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38% and median Tmax was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide injection. Acetaminophen Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1,000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Acetaminophen Cmax was decreased by 31% and median Tmax was delayed up to 15 minutes. Griseofulvin Liraglutide injection did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide injection at steady state. Griseofulvin Cmax increased by 37% while median Tmax did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide injection at steady state. Liraglutide injection lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of liraglutide injection on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide injection increased the levonorgestrel AUC0-\u221e by 18%. Liraglutide injection delayed Tmax for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide injection and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide injection or other liraglutide products. A subset of liraglutide injection-treated patients (1,104 of 2,501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] and 102/1,104 (9%) of liraglutide injection-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide injection-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide injection-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide injection. In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide injection-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide injection-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide injection-treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide injection-treated patients at week 53. None of the 5 patients had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1 or had neutralizing antibodies. Figure 2"], "manufacturer_name": ["Hybio Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

IL-17RA is a protein expressed on the cell surface and is a required component of receptor complexes utilized by multiple IL-17 family cytokines. Blocking IL-17RA inhibits IL-17 cytokine-induced responses including the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Elevated levels of IL-17A, IL-17C, and IL-17F are found in psoriatic plaques. Serum IL-17A levels, measured at Weeks 12, 24, and 48 of SILIQ 210 mg every 2 weeks of treatment, were higher than the baseline levels in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The relationship between the pharmacodynamic activity and the mechanism(s) by which brodalumab exerts its clinical effects is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single subcutaneous dose of 210 mg in subjects with plaque psoriasis, brodalumab reached peak mean (\u00b1SD) serum concentration (C max ) of 13.4\u00b17.3 mcg/mL by approximately 3 days post-dose. The mean (\u00b1SD) area-under-the-concentration-time curve (AUC) of brodalumab was 111\u00b164 mcg\u2022day/mL. Following multiple subcutaneous doses of 210 mg every 2 weeks, steady-state was achieved by Week 4. The mean (\u00b1SD) C max was 20.6\u00b114.6 mcg/mL and the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC over the 2-week dosing interval was 227\u00b1167 mcg\u2022day/mL. Following subcutaneous administration, brodalumab bioavailability was approximately 55%. Distribution Following a single subcutaneous administration of brodalumab 210 mg in subjects with plaque psoriasis, the mean (\u00b1SD) apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of brodalumab was 8.9\u00b19.4 L. Elimination The metabolic pathway of brodalumab has not been characterized. As a human monoclonal IgG2 antibody, brodalumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in a manner similar to endogenous IgG. Following a single subcutaneous administration of brodalumab 210 mg in subjects with plaque psoriasis, the mean (\u00b1SD) apparent total clearance (CL/F) was 3.0\u00b13.5 L/day. The clearance of brodalumab increased with decreasing doses due to nonlinear elimination. Dose Linearity Brodalumab exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics with exposures that increased greater than dose-proportionally over a dose range from 140 mg (approximately 0.67 times the recommended dose) to 350 mg (approximately 1.67 times the recommended dose) following subcutaneous administrations in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Weight Brodalumab trough concentrations were lower in subjects with higher body weight. Specific Populations Hepatic or Renal Impairment No trials were conducted to assess the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of brodalumab. Age: Geriatric Population Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age did not significantly influence the clearance of brodalumab in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Subjects who were 65 years or older had a similar brodalumab clearance as compared to subjects less than 65 years old. Drug Interaction Studies In subjects with plaque psoriasis, one week following a single subcutaneous administration of 210 mg brodalumab, the exposure of midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) was increased by 24% [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bausch Health US LLC"], "substance_name": ["BRODALUMAB"], "effective_time": "20241107", "product_ndc": ["0187-0004"], "brand_name": ["Siliq"]}
