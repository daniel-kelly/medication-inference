{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE Thiotepa for Injection, USP has been tried with varying results in the palliation of a wide variety of neoplastic diseases. However, the most consistent results have been seen in the following tumors: 1. Adenocarcinoma of the breast. 2. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 3. For controlling intracavitary effusions secondary to diffuse or localized neoplastic diseases of various serosal cavities. 4. For the treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder. While now largely superseded by other treatments, thiotepa has been effective against other lymphomas, such as lymphosarcoma and Hodgkin\u2019s disease."], "generic_name": ["THIOTEPA"], "id": "e880a370-00f9-f7c7-a992-64756718360b", "route": ["INTRACAVITARY", "INTRAVENOUS", "INTRAVESICAL"], "description": ["DESCRIPTION Thiotepa for Injection, USP is an ethylenimine-type compound. It is supplied as a non-pyrogenic, sterile Iyophilized powder for intravenous, intracavitary or intravesical administration, containing 15 mg of thiotepa. Thiotepa for injection is a synthetic product with antitumor activity. The chemical name for thiotepa is Aziridine, 1,1\u20191\u201d-phosphinothioylidynetris-, or Tris (1-aziridinyl) phosphine sulfide. Thiotepa USP has the following structural formula: Thiotepa USP has the empirical formula C 6 H 12 N 3 PS, and a molecular weight of 189.22. When reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, the resulting solution has a pH of approximately 5.5 to 7.5. Thiotepa USP is stable in alkaline medium and unstable in acid medium."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethylenimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principal bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position, which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines. The pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and TEPA in thirteen female patients (45 to 84 years) with advanced stage ovarian cancer receiving 60 mg and 80 mg thiotepa by intravenous infusion on subsequent courses given at 4 week intervals are presented in the following table: Pharmacokinetic Parameters (units) Mean \u00b1 SEM Thiotepa TEPA 60 mg 80 mg 60 mg 80 mg Peak Serum concentration (ng/mL) 1331 \u00b1 119 1828 \u00b1 135 273 \u00b1 46 353 \u00b1 46 Elimination half-life (h) 2.4 \u00b1 0.3 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 17.6 \u00b1 3.6 15.7 \u00b1 2.7 Area under the curve (ng/h/mL) 2832 \u00b1 412 4127 \u00b1 668 4789 \u00b1 1022 7452 \u00b1 1667 Total body clearance (mL/min) 446 \u00b1 63 419 \u00b1 56 TEPA, which possesses cytotoxic activity, appears to be the major metabolite of thiotepa found in human serum and urine. Urinary excretion of 14 C-labeled thiotepa and metabolites in a 34-year old patient with metastatic carcinoma of the cecum who received a dose of 0.3 mg/kg intravenously was 63%. Thiotepa and TEPA in urine each accounts for less than 2% of the administered dose. The pharmacokinetics of thiotepa in renal and hepatic dysfunction patients have not been evaluated. Possible pharmacokinetic interactions of thiotepa with any concomitantly administered medications have not been formally investigated."], "manufacturer_name": ["Dr.Reddy's Laboratories Inc.,"], "substance_name": ["THIOTEPA"], "effective_time": "20180425", "product_ndc": ["43598-650"], "brand_name": ["Thiotepa"]}
