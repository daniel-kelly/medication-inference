Structural Formula Active Component System"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, 2 estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman\u2019s therapeutic response to estradiol transdermal system nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a multiple-dose study consisting of 3 consecutive system applications of the original formulation of estradiol transdermal system which was conducted in 17 healthy, postmenopausal women, blood levels of estradiol and estrone were compared following application of these units to sites on the abdomen and buttocks in a crossover fashion. Systems that deliver nominal estradiol doses of approximately 0.0375 mg per day and 0.1 mg per day were applied to abdominal application sites while the 0.1 mg per day doses were also applied to sites on the buttocks. These systems increased estradiol levels above baseline within 4 hours and maintained respective mean levels of 25 and 79 pg/mL above baseline following application to the abdomen; slightly higher mean levels of 88 pg/mL above baseline were observed following application to the buttocks. At the same time, increases in estrone plasma concentrations averaged about 12 and 50 pg/mL, respectively, following application to the abdomen and 61 pg/mL for the buttocks. While plasma concentrations of estradiol and estrone remained slightly above baseline at 12 hours following removal of the systems in this study, results from another study show these levels to return to baseline values within 24 hours following removal of the systems. Figure 1 illustrates the mean plasma concentrations of estradiol at steady-state during application of these patches at 4 different dosages. Figure 1.

Estradiol transdermal system, the revised formulation with smaller system sizes, was shown to be bioequivalent to the original formulation of estradiol transdermal system, used in the clinical trials. Distribution The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver by Cytochrome 450 isoforms CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Estradiol undergoes further metabolism to sulfate and glucuronide conjugates. Estradiol and its metabolites are glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and UGT2B7. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women a significant portion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens. Excretion Estradiol, estrone and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The half-life values calculated after dosing with the estradiol transdermal system ranged from 5.9 to 7.7 hours. After removal of the transdermal systems, serum concentrations of estradiol and estrone returned to baseline levels within 24 hours. Adhesion Based on combined data from 3 short-term clinical trials consisting of 471 observations, 85% of estradiol transdermal system adhered completely to the skin over the 3.5-day wear period. Three percent (3%) of the systems detached and were reapplied or replaced during the 3.5-day wear period.

Clonidine is a centrally acting alpha\u2011agonist hypotensive agent. It is an imidazoline derivative with the chemical name 2,6\u2011dichloro\u2011N\u20112\u2011imidazolidinylidenebenzenamine and has the following chemical structure: System Structure and Components Clonidine Transdermal System, USP is a multi-layered film, 0.2 mm thick, containing clonidine as the active agent. The system areas are 3.5 cm 2 (Clonidine Transdermal System USP, 0.1 mg/day), 7.0 cm 2 (Clonidine Transdermal System USP, 0.2 mg/day) and 10.5 cm 2 (Clonidine Transdermal System USP, 0.3 mg/day) and the amount of drug released is directly proportional to the area (see Release Rate Concept ). The composition per unit area is the same for all three doses. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, there are four consecutive layers: 1) a backing layer of pigmented polyester and aluminum film; 2) a drug reservoir of clonidine, mineral oil, polyisobutylene, and colloidal silicon dioxide; 3) a microporous polypropylene membrane that controls the rate of delivery of clonidine from the system to the skin surface; 4) an adhesive formulation of clonidine, mineral oil, polyisobutylene, and colloidal silicon dioxide. Prior to use, a protective slit release liner of polyester that covers the adhesive layer is removed. Cross Section of the System: cross-section-table Release Rate Concept Clonidine Transdermal System, USP, is programmed to release clonidine at an approximately constant rate for 7 days. The energy for drug release is derived from the concentration gradient existing between a saturated solution of drug in the system and the much lower concentration prevailing in the skin. Clonidine flows in the direction of the lower concentration at a constant rate, limited by the rate\u2011controlling membrane, so long as a saturated solution is maintained in the drug reservoir. Following system application to intact skin, clonidine in the adhesive layer saturates the skin site below the system. Clonidine from the drug reservoir then begins to flow through the rate\u2011controlling membrane and the adhesive layer of the system into the systemic circulation via the capillaries beneath the skin. Therapeutic plasma clonidine levels are achieved 2 to 3 days after initial application of Clonidine Transdermal System, USP, 0.1 mg/day. The 3.5, 7.0, and 10.5 cm 2 systems deliver 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg of clonidine per day, respectively. To ensure constant release of drug for 7 days, the total drug content of the system is higher than the total amount of drug delivered. Application of a new system to a fresh skin site at weekly intervals continuously maintains therapeutic plasma concentrations of clonidine. If the Clonidine Transdermal System, USP is removed and not replaced with a new system, therapeutic plasma clonidine levels will persist for about 8 hours and then decline slowly over several days. Over this time period, blood pressure returns gradually to pretreatment levels. clonidine structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Clonidine stimulates alpha\u2011adrenoreceptors in the brain stem. This action results in reduced sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system and in decreases in peripheral resistance, renal vascular resistance, heart rate, and blood pressure. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate remain essentially unchanged. Normal postural reflexes are intact; therefore, orthostatic symptoms are mild and infrequent. Acute studies with clonidine hydrochloride in humans have demonstrated a moderate reduction (15% to 20%) of cardiac output in the supine position with no change in the peripheral resistance; at a 45\u00b0 tilt there is a smaller reduction in cardiac output and a decrease of peripheral resistance. During long\u2011term therapy, cardiac output tends to return to control values, while peripheral resistance remains decreased. Slowing of the pulse rate has been observed in most patients given clonidine, but the drug does not alter normal hemodynamic responses to exercise. Tolerance to the antihypertensive effect may develop in some patients, necessitating a reevaluation of therapy. Other studies in patients have provided evidence of a reduction in plasma renin activity and in the excretion of aldosterone and catecholamines. The exact relationship of these pharmacologic actions to the antihypertensive effect of clonidine has not been fully elucidated. Clonidine acutely stimulates the release of growth hormone in children as well as adults but does not produce a chronic elevation of growth hormone with long\u2011term use. Pharmacokinetics Clonidine transdermal system delivers clonidine at an approximately constant rate for 7 days. The absolute bioavailability of clonidine from the clonidine transdermal system dosage form is approximately 60%. Steady-state clonidine plasma levels are obtained within 3 days after transdermal application to the upper outer arm and increase linearly with increasing size of the transdermal patch. Mean steady-state plasma concentrations with the 3.5 cm 2 , 7.0 cm 2 and 10.5 cm 2 systems are approximately 0.4 ng/mL, 0.8 ng/mL, and 1.1 ng/mL, respectively. Similar clonidine steady-state concentrations are reached after application to the chest. Steady-state clonidine plasma levels remain constant after removal of one system and application of a new system of the same size. Following intravenous administration clonidine displays biphasic disposition with a distribution half-life of about 20 minutes and an elimination half-life ranging from 12 to 16 hours. The half-life increases up to 41 hours in patients with severe impairment of renal function. Clonidine has a total clearance of 177 mL/min and a renal clearance of 102 mL/min. The apparent volume of distribution (V z ) of clonidine is 197 L (2.9 L/kg). Clonidine crosses the placental barrier. It has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier in rats. Following oral administration, about 40% to 60% of the absorbed dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug within 24 hours. About 50% of the absorbed dose is metabolized in the liver. After removal of the clonidine transdermal system, clonidine plasma concentrations decline slowly with a half-life of approximately 20 hours."], "manufacturer_name": ["TruPharma, LLC"], "substance_name": ["CLONIDINE"], "effective_time": "20250417", "product_ndc": ["52817-610", "52817-611", "52817-612"], "brand_name": ["Clonidine Transdermal System USP, 0.1 mg/day"]}

Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, acetone, and ethyl acetate and very slightly soluble in water. Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of Trubrexa TM Transdermal Patch is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Capsaicin is an agonist for the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1), which is an ion channel-receptor complex expressed on nociceptive nerve fibers in the skin. Topical administration of capsaicin causes an initial enhanced stimulation of the TRPV1-expressing cutaneous nociceptors that may be associated with painful sensations. This is followed by pain relief thought to be mediated by a reduction in TRPV1-expressing nociceptive nerve endings. 10.2 Pharmacokinetics The amount of lidocaine and capsaicin systemically absorbed from Trubrexa TM Transdermal Patch is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied.

This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. The effect of rivastigmine may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. There is no evidence that rivastigmine alters the course of the underlying dementing process. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After a 6-mg oral dose of rivastigmine in humans, anticholinesterase activity is present in cerebrospinal fluid for about 10 hours, with a maximum inhibition of about 60% 5 hours after dosing. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that the inhibition of cholinesterase by rivastigmine is not affected by the concomitant administration of memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After the initial application of EXELON PATCH, there is a lag time of 0.5 to 1 hour in the absorption of rivastigmine.

After the peak, plasma concentrations slowly decrease over the remainder of the 24-hour period of application. At steady state, trough levels are approximately 60% to 80% of peak levels. EXELON PATCH 9.5 mg/24 hours gave exposure approximately the same as that provided by an oral dose of 6 mg twice daily (i.e., 12 mg/day). Inter-subject variability in exposure was lower (43% to 49%) for the EXELON PATCH formulation as compared with the oral formulations (73% to 103%). Fluctuation (between C max and C min ) is less for EXELON PATCH than for the oral formulation of rivastigmine. Figure 2 displays rivastigmine plasma concentrations over 24 hours for the 3 available patch strengths. Figure 2: Rivastigmine Plasma Concentrations Following Dermal 24-Hour Patch Application Over a 24-hour dermal application, approximately 50% of the drug content of the patch is released from the system. Exposure area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC \u221e ) to rivastigmine (and metabolite NAP226-90) was highest when the patch was applied to the upper back, chest, or upper arm. Two other sites (abdomen and thigh) could be used if none of the 3 other sites is available, but the practitioner should be aware that the rivastigmine plasma exposure associated with these sites was approximately 20% to 30% lower. There was no relevant accumulation of rivastigmine or the metabolite NAP226-90 in plasma in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease with daily dosing. The pharmacokinetic profile of rivastigmine transdermal patches was comparable in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Distribution Rivastigmine is weakly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 40%) over the therapeutic range. It readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, reaching CSF peak concentrations in 1.4 to 2.6 hours. It has an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8 to 2.7 L/kg. Metabolism Rivastigmine is extensively metabolized primarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite NAP226-90. In vitro , this metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (less than 10%). Based on evidence from in vitro and animal studies, the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism. The metabolite-to-parent AUC \u221e ratio was about 0.7 after EXELON PATCH application versus 3.5 after oral administration, indicating that much less metabolism occurred after dermal treatment. Less NAP226-90 is formed following patch application, presumably because of the lack of presystemic (hepatic first pass) metabolism. Based on in vitro studies, no unique metabolic routes were detected in human skin. Elimination Renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route of elimination. Unchanged rivastigmine is found in trace amounts in the urine. Following administration of 14 C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and essentially complete (greater than 90%) within 24 hours. Less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted in the feces. The apparent elimination half-life in plasma is approximately 3 hours after patch removal. Renal clearance was approximately 2.1 to 2.8 L/hr. Age Age had no impact on the exposure to rivastigmine in Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients treated with EXELON PATCH. Gender and Race No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effect of gender and race on the disposition of EXELON PATCH. A population pharmacokinetic analysis of oral rivastigmine indicated that neither gender (n = 277 males and 348 females) nor race (n = 575 Caucasian, 34 black, 4 Asian, and 12 Other) affected clearance of the drug. Similar results were seen with analyses of pharmacokinetic data obtained after the administration of EXELON PATCH. Body Weight A relationship between drug exposure at steady state (rivastigmine and metabolite NAP226-90) and body weight was observed in Alzheimer\u2019s dementia patients. Rivastigmine exposure is higher in subjects with low body weight. Compared to a patient with a body weight of 65 kg, the rivastigmine steady-state concentrations in a patient with a body weight of 35 kg would be approximately doubled, while for a patient with a body weight of 100 kg the concentrations would be approximately halved [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Renal Impairment No study was conducted with EXELON PATCH in subjects with renal impairment. Based on population analysis, creatinine clearance did not show any clear effect on steady-state concentrations of rivastigmine or its metabolite. Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic study was conducted with EXELON PATCH in subjects with hepatic impairment. Following a single 3-mg dose, mean oral clearance of rivastigmine was 60% lower in hepatically impaired patients (n = 10, biopsy proven) than in healthy subjects (n = 10). After multiple 6-mg twice a day oral dosing, the mean clearance of rivastigmine was 65% lower in mild (n = 7, Child-Pugh score 5 to 6) and moderate (n = 3, Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) hepatically impaired patients (biopsy proven, liver cirrhosis) than in healthy subjects (n = 10) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Smoking Following oral rivastigmine administration (up to 12 mg/day) with nicotine use, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed increased oral clearance of rivastigmine by 23% (n = 75 smokers and 549 nonsmokers). Drug Interaction Studies No specific interaction studies have been conducted with EXELON PATCH. Information presented below is from studies with oral rivastigmine. Effect of Rivastigmine on the Metabolism of Other Drugs Rivastigmine is primarily metabolized through hydrolysis by esterases. Minimal metabolism occurs via the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic drug interactions with drugs metabolized by the following isoenzyme systems are expected: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine taken orally and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam, or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of rivastigmine. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Rivastigmine Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP450 metabolism are not expected to alter the metabolism of rivastigmine. Population pharmacokinetic analysis with a database of 625 patients showed that the pharmacokinetics of rivastigmine taken orally were not influenced by commonly prescribed medications, such as antacids (n = 77), antihypertensives (n = 72), beta-blockers (n = 42), calcium channel blockers (n = 75), antidiabetics (n = 21), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 79), estrogens (n = 70), salicylate analgesics (n = 177), antianginals (n = 35), and antihistamines (n = 15).

The exact mode of therapeutic action in ADHD is not known. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Amphetamines block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following a single 9-hour application of XELSTRYM in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years with ADHD, the C max and AUC of dextroamphetamine were dose-proportional over the dose range of 4.5 mg/9 hours to 18 mg/9 hours. After a single dose of 18 mg/9 hours of XELSTRYM or 70 mg of lisdexamfetamine in adults, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) of dextroamphetamine were 44.6 ng/mL and 67.6 ng/mL, respectively; and area under concentration curve (AUC inf ) of dextroamphetamine were 996 ng*h/mL and 1260 ng*h/mL, respectively. Median time-to-peak concentrations (t max ) was 9 hours for XELSTRYM and 4 hours for lisdexamfetamine. The plasma PK profiles of dextroamphetamine following administration of XELSTRYM and lisdexamfetamine are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Mean Plasma Concentrations versus Time Profile of Dextroamphetamine After a Single Dose Administration of XELSTRYM and Lisdexamfetamine in Healthy Adults After multiple dosing of 18 mg/9 hours of XELSTRYM with application site rotation in adults or 70 mg of lisdexamfetamine (simulated), C max of dextroamphetamine were 68.8 ng/mL and 84.5 ng/mL, respectively; AUC 0-24 of dextroamphetamine were 1150 ng*h/mL and 1248 ng*h/mL, respectively. Absorption The amount of dextroamphetamine absorbed systemically is a function of both wear time and transdermal system size. Peak plasma levels of dextroamphetamine were typically reached at 6 to 9 hours after single application and 6 hours after repeat applications of XELSTRYM when worn up to 9 hours. On average, approximately 90% of dextroamphetamine is delivered from the transdermal system over 9 hours. Inter-individual variability for XELSTRYM as coefficient of variation (%CV) for the dextroamphetamine C max and AUC was generally about 20% to 30%. After repeat applications of XELSTRYM for 4 weeks in adults with ADHD, there was 46% increase in C max and 54% increase in AUC 0-24 when applied with rotating application sites for each transdermal system. There was 86% increase in C max and 104% increase in AUC 0-24 when XELSTRYM was applied on the same site for 28 days. Application of a heating pad on XELSTRYM for 6 consecutive hours led to a faster absorption rate (median T max about 6.5 hours) as compared with XELSTRYM without a heating pad (median T max about 8.5 hours). Geometric least square mean ratios for dextroamphetamine exposure, calculated as C max and AUC 0-9h , were about 116% and 150%, respectively, compared with XELSTRYM without a heating pad, indicating the apparent heat effect on dextroamphetamine absorption. The application of XELSTYRM to different sites (hip, upper arm, chest, upper back and flank) did not alter dextroamphetamine PK. Elimination When XELSTRYM is removed after 9 hours wear time, the mean apparent elimination half-life of dextroamphetamine ranged from 6.4 to 11.5 hours in the pediatric and adult population, respectively. Metabolism Amphetamine is reported to be oxidized at the 4 position of the benzene ring to form 4-hydroxyamphetamine, or on the side chain \u03b1 or \u03b2 carbons to form alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine or norephedrine, respectively. Norephedrine and 4-hydroxy-amphetamine are both active and each is subsequently oxidized to form 4-hydroxy-norephedrine. Alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine undergoes deamination to form phenylacetone, which ultimately forms benzoic acid and its glucuronide and the glycine conjugate hippuric acid. Although the enzymes involved in amphetamine metabolism have not been clearly defined, CYP2D6 is known to be involved with formation of 4-hydroxy-amphetamine. Since CYP2D6 is genetically polymorphic, population variations in amphetamine metabolism are a possibility. Excretion With normal urine pHs, approximately half of an administered oral dose of amphetamine is recoverable in urine as derivatives of alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine and approximately another 30-40% of the dose is recoverable in urine as amphetamine itself. Since amphetamine has a pKa of 9.9, urinary recovery of amphetamine is highly dependent on pH and urine flow rates. Alkaline urine pHs result in less ionization and reduced renal elimination, and acidic pHs and high flow rates result in increased renal elimination with clearances greater than glomerular filtration rates, indicating the involvement of active secretion. Urinary recovery of amphetamine has been reported to range from 1% to 75%, depending on urinary pH, with the remaining fraction of the dose hepatically metabolized. Consequently, both hepatic and renal dysfunction have the potential to inhibit the elimination of amphetamine and result in prolonged exposures. In addition, drugs that affect urinary pH are known to alter the elimination of amphetamine, and any decrease in amphetamine's metabolism that might occur due to drug interactions or genetic polymorphisms is more likely to be clinically significant when renal elimination is decreased [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7) ] . Specific Populations The shapes of pharmacokinetic profiles after XELSTRYM application were generally similar between the pediatric and the adult population. Based on population PK, the median C max in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years are predicted to be 120% and 180%, respectively, the median AUC in pediatric patients are predicted to be 112% and 148%, respectively, of those in adults with a dose of 18 mg/9 hours.

Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated concentrations of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman\u2019s therapeutic response to LYLLANA nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a single-dose, two way-crossover clinical study conducted in 96 healthy, non-smoking postmenopausal women under fed condition, LYLLANA (0.1 mg per day) was bioequivalent to Vivelle (0.1 mg per day) based on estradiol exposure (AUC 0-84 ) and estradiol peak concentration (C max ) following a single-dose on the lower abdomen for 84 hours. Estradiol pharmacokinetics were characterized in a separate open-label, single-center, randomized, single-dose, three-way crossover study conducted in 36 healthy, non-smoking postmenopausal women (aged 40 to 65 years). LYLLANA transdermal systems delivering nominal estradiol of approximately 0.025 mg, 0.05 mg, and 0.1 mg per day were applied to the lower abdomen under fed state in a crossover fashion for 84 hours. The mean estradiol pharmacokinetics parameters are summarized in Table 2. AUC and C max are dose proportional from 0.025 mg to 0.1 mg per day.

Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women a significant portion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens. Excretion Estradiol, estrone and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The mean half-life values of estradiol calculated from treatment groups in the bioequivalence study and dose-proportionality study after dosing with LYLLANA ranged from 6.2 to 7.9 hours. After removal of the transdermal systems, serum concentrations of estradiol and estrone returned to baseline concentrations within 24 hours. Adhesion and Adhesive Residue Based on combined data from bioequivalence and dose proportionality studies consisting of 208 LYLLANA observations, approximately 98 percent of the observations had an adhesion score of 0 (i.e., the skin adhesion rate was greater than or equal to 90 percent) over the 84-hour wear period. One woman had a complete detachment during the wear period. Approximately 65 percent of the transdermal systems evaluated in these studies were with LYLLANA 0.1 mg per day (6.6 cm 2 active surface area). After removal of LYLLANA, women had either no adhesive residue (score of 0) or light adhesive residue (score of 1). No woman had medium adhesive residue. Of the 208 LYLLANA observations, 54 percent had light adhesive residue and 46 percent had no adhesive residue.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 10.1 Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol:water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4. Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, acetone, and ethyl acetate and very slightly soluble in water. Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of Trubrexa TM Transdermal Patch is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Capsaicin is an agonist for the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1), which is an ion channel-receptor complex expressed on nociceptive nerve fibers in the skin. Topical administration of capsaicin causes an initial enhanced stimulation of the TRPV1-expressing cutaneous nociceptors that may be associated with painful sensations. This is followed by pain relief thought to be mediated by a reduction in TRPV1-expressing nociceptive nerve endings. 10.2 Pharmacokinetics The amount of lidocaine and capsaicin systemically absorbed from Trubrexa TM Transdermal Patch is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. Systemic exposure decreases upon removal of Trubrexa TM Transdermal Patch. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine.

Structure Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fentanyl is an opioid agonist. Fentanyl interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Fentanyl produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Fentanyl causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. In clinical trials of 357 non-opioid tolerant subjects treated with fentanyl transdermal system, 13 subjects experienced hypoventilation. Hypoventilation was manifested by respiratory rates of less than 8 breaths/minute or a pCO 2 greater than 55 mm Hg. In these studies, the incidence of hypoventilation was higher in nontolerant women (10) than in men (3) and in subjects weighing less than 63 kg (9 of 13). Although subjects with prior impaired respiration were not common in the trials, they had higher rates of hypoventilation. In addition, post-marketing reports have been received that describe opioid-naive post-operative patients who have experienced clinically significant hypoventilation and death with fentanyl transdermal system. Hypoventilation can occur throughout the therapeutic range of fentanyl serum concentrations, especially for patients who have an underlying pulmonary condition or who receive concomitant opioids or other CNS drugs associated with hypoventilation. The use of fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated in patients who are not tolerant to opioid therapy. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Fentanyl causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Fentanyl produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Histamine assays and skin wheal testing in clinical studies indicate that clinically significant histamine release rarely occurs with fentanyl administration. Clinical assays show no clinically significant histamine release in dosages up to 50 mcg/kg. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of fentanyl for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.3 )]. Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing fentanyl plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fentanyl transdermal system is a drug-in-adhesive matrix designed formulation. Fentanyl is released from the matrix at a nearly constant amount per unit time. The concentration gradient existing between the matrix and the lower concentration in the skin, drives drug release. Fentanyl moves in the direction of the lower concentration at a rate determined by the matrix and the diffusion of fentanyl through the skin layers. While the actual rate of fentanyl delivery to the skin varies over the 72-hour application period, each system is labeled with a nominal flux which represents the average amount of drug delivered to the systemic circulation per hour across average skin. While there is variation in dose delivered among patients, the nominal flux of the systems (12.5, 25, 37.5, 50, 75, and 100 mcg of fentanyl per hour) is sufficiently accurate as to allow individual titration of dosage for a given patient. Following fentanyl transdermal system application, the skin under the system absorbs fentanyl, and a depot of fentanyl concentrates in the upper skin layers. Fentanyl then becomes available to the systemic circulation. Serum fentanyl concentrations increase gradually following initial fentanyl transdermal system application, generally leveling off between 12 and 24 hours and remaining relatively constant, with some fluctuation, for the remainder of the 72-hour application period. Peak serum concentrations of fentanyl generally occurred between 20 and 72 hours after initial application (see Table 6). Serum fentanyl concentrations achieved are proportional to the fentanyl transdermal system delivery rate. With continuous use, serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. By the end of the second 72-hour application, a steady-state serum concentration is reached and is maintained during subsequent applications of a patch of the same size (see Figure 1). Patients reach and maintain a steady-state serum concentration that is determined by individual variation in skin permeability and body clearance of fentanyl. After system removal, serum fentanyl concentrations decline gradually, falling about 50% in approximately 20 to 27 hours. Continued absorption of fentanyl from the skin accounts for a slower disappearance of the drug from the serum than is seen after an IV infusion, where the apparent half-life is approximately 7 (range 3 to 12) hours. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased mean overall fentanyl exposure by 120% and average maximum fentanyl level by 61%.

Distribution Fentanyl plasma protein binding capacity decreases with increasing ionization of the drug. Alterations in pH may affect its distribution between plasma and the central nervous system. Fentanyl accumulates in the skeletal muscle and fat and is released slowly into the blood. The average volume of distribution for fentanyl is 6 L/kg (range 3 to 8; N=8). Elimination Metabolism Fentanyl is metabolized primarily via human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system. In humans, the drug appears to be metabolized primarily by oxidative N-dealkylation to norfentanyl and other inactive metabolites that do not contribute materially to the observed activity of the drug. Skin does not appear to metabolize fentanyl delivered transdermally. This was determined in a human keratinocyte cell assay and in clinical studies in which 92% of the dose delivered from the system was accounted for as unchanged fentanyl that appeared in the systemic circulation. Excretion Within 72 hours of IV fentanyl administration, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine, mostly as metabolites with less than 10% representing unchanged drug. Approximately 9% of the dose is recovered in the feces, primarily as metabolites. Mean values for unbound fractions of fentanyl in plasma are estimated to be between 13 and 21%. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population Data from intravenous studies with fentanyl suggest that the elderly patients may have reduced clearance and a prolonged half-life. Moreover elderly patients may be more sensitive to the active substance than younger patients. A study conducted with the fentanyl transdermal patch in elderly patients demonstrated that fentanyl pharmacokinetics did not differ significantly from young adult subjects, although peak serum concentrations tended to be lower and mean half-life values were prolonged to approximately 34 hours. In this study, a single fentanyl transdermal system 100 mcg/hour patch was applied to a skin site on the upper outer arm in a group of healthy elderly Caucasians \u226565 years old (n=21, mean age 71 years) and worn for 72 hours. The mean C max and AUC \u221e values were approximately 8% lower and 7% higher, respectively, in the elderly subjects as compared with subjects 18 to 45 years old. Inter-subject variability in AUC \u221e was higher in elderly subjects than in healthy adult subjects 18 to 45 years (58% and 37%, respectively). The mean half-life value was longer in subjects \u226565 years old than in subjects 18 to 45 years old (34.4 hours versus 23.5 hours) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Age: Pediatric Population In 1.5 to 5 year old, non-opioid-tolerant pediatric patients, the fentanyl plasma concentrations were approximately twice as high as that of adult patients. In older pediatric patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to that of adults. However, these findings have been taken into consideration in determining the dosing recommendations for opioid-tolerant pediatric patients (2 years of age and older). For pediatric dosing information, refer to [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Hepatic Impairment Information on the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl transdermal system is limited. The pharmacokinetics of fentanyl transdermal system delivering 50 mcg/hour of fentanyl for 72 hours was evaluated in patients hospitalized for surgery. Compared to the controlled patients (n=8), C max and AUC in the patients with cirrhosis (n=9) increased 35% and 73%, respectively. Because there is in-vitro and in-vivo evidence of extensive hepatic contribution to the elimination of fentanyl transdermal system, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl transdermal system. Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosing and Administration ( 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 ), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Impairment Information on the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl transdermal system is limited. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous injection of 25 mcg/kg fentanyl was evaluated in patients (n=8) undergoing kidney transplantation. An inverse relationship between blood urea nitrogen level and fentanyl clearance was found. Because there is in-vivo evidence of renal contribution to the elimination of fentanyl transdermal system, renal impairment would be expected to have significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl transdermal system. Avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosing and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.17 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug Interaction Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4). The interaction between ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, and fentanyl was investigated in eleven healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Subjects received oral ritonavir or placebo for 3 days. The ritonavir dose was 200 mg three times a day on Day 1 and 300 mg three times a day on Day 2 followed by one morning dose of 300 mg on Day 3. On Day 2, fentanyl was given as a single IV dose at 5 mcg/kg two hours after the afternoon dose of oral ritonavir or placebo. Naloxone was administered to counteract the side effects of fentanyl. The results suggested that ritonavir might decrease the clearance of fentanyl by 67%, resulting in a 174% (range 52% to 420%) increase in fentanyl AUC 0-\u221e . The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, or grapefruit juice) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of respiratory depression for an extended period of time and adjust the dosage if warranted [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), and Drug Interactions ( 7 )].

Following fentanyl transdermal system application, the skin under the system absorbs fentanyl, and a depot of fentanyl concentrates in the upper skin layers. Fentanyl then becomes available to the systemic circulation. Serum fentanyl concentrations increase gradually following initial fentanyl transdermal system application, generally leveling off between 12 and 24 hours and remaining relatively constant, with some fluctuation, for the remainder of the 72-hour application period. Peak serum concentrations of fentanyl generally occurred between 20 and 72 hours after initial application (see Table 6).

With continuous use, serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. By the end of the second 72-hour application, a steady-state serum concentration is reached and is maintained during subsequent applications of a patch of the same size (see Figure 1). Patients reach and maintain a steady-state serum concentration that is determined by individual variation in skin permeability and body clearance of fentanyl. After system removal, serum fentanyl concentrations decline gradually, falling about 50% in approximately 20 to 27 hours.

Distribution Fentanyl plasma protein binding capacity decreases with increasing ionization of the drug. Alterations in pH may affect its distribution between plasma and the central nervous system. Fentanyl accumulates in the skeletal muscle and fat and is released slowly into the blood. The average volume of distribution for fentanyl is 6 L/kg (range 3 to 8; N=8). Elimination Metabolism Fentanyl is metabolized primarily via human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system. In humans, the drug appears to be metabolized primarily by oxidative N-dealkylation to norfentanyl and other inactive metabolites that do not contribute materially to the observed activity of the drug. Skin does not appear to metabolize fentanyl delivered transdermally. This was determined in a human keratinocyte cell assay and in clinical studies in which 92% of the dose delivered from the system was accounted for as unchanged fentanyl that appeared in the systemic circulation. Excretion Within 72 hours of IV fentanyl administration, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine, mostly as metabolites with less than 10% representing unchanged drug. Approximately 9% of the dose is recovered in the feces, primarily as metabolites. Mean values for unbound fractions of fentanyl in plasma are estimated to be between 13 and 21%. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population Data from intravenous studies with fentanyl suggest that the elderly patients may have reduced clearance and a prolonged half-life. Moreover elderly patients may be more sensitive to the active substance than younger patients. A study conducted with the fentanyl transdermal patch in elderly patients demonstrated that fentanyl pharmacokinetics did not differ significantly from young adult subjects, although peak serum concentrations tended to be lower and mean half-life values were prolonged to approximately 34 hours. In this study, a single fentanyl transdermal system 100 mcg/hour patch was applied to a skin site on the upper outer arm in a group of healthy elderly Caucasians \u226565 years old (n=21, mean age 71 years) and worn for 72 hours. The mean C max and AUC \u221e values were approximately 8% lower and 7% higher, respectively, in the elderly subjects as compared with subjects 18 to 45 years old. Inter-subject variability in AUC \u221e was higher in elderly subjects than in healthy adult subjects 18 to 45 years (58% and 37%, respectively). The mean half-life value was longer in subjects \u226565 years old than in subjects 18 to 45 years old (34.4 hours versus 23.5 hours) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Age: Pediatric Population In 1.5 to 5 year old, non-opioid-tolerant pediatric patients, the fentanyl plasma concentrations were approximately twice as high as that of adult patients. In older pediatric patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to that of adults. However, these findings have been taken into consideration in determining the dosing recommendations for opioid-tolerant pediatric patients (2 years of age and older). For pediatric dosing information, refer to [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Hepatic Impairment Information on the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl transdermal system is limited. The pharmacokinetics of fentanyl transdermal system delivering 50 mcg/hour of fentanyl for 72 hours was evaluated in patients hospitalized for surgery. Compared to the controlled patients (n=8), C max and AUC in the patients with cirrhosis (n=9) increased 35% and 73%, respectively. Because there is in-vitro and in-vivo evidence of extensive hepatic contribution to the elimination of fentanyl transdermal system, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl transdermal system. Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosing and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.17 ), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Impairment Information on the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl transdermal system is limited. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous injection of 25 mcg/kg fentanyl was evaluated in patients (n=8) undergoing kidney transplantation. An inverse relationship between blood urea nitrogen level and fentanyl clearance was found. Because there is in-vivo evidence of renal contribution to the elimination of fentanyl transdermal system, renal impairment would be expected to have significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl transdermal system. Avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosing and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.18 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug Interaction Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4). The interaction between ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, and fentanyl was investigated in eleven healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Subjects received oral ritonavir or placebo for 3 days. The ritonavir dose was 200 mg three times a day on Day 1 and 300 mg three times a day on Day 2 followed by one morning dose of 300 mg on Day 3. On Day 2, fentanyl was given as a single IV dose at 5 mcg/kg two hours after the afternoon dose of oral ritonavir or placebo. Naloxone was administered to counteract the side effects of fentanyl. The results suggested that ritonavir might decrease the clearance of fentanyl by 67%, resulting in a 174% (range 52% to 420%) increase in fentanyl AUC 0-\u221e . The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazodone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, or grapefruit juice) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of respiratory depression for an extended period of time and adjust the dosage if warranted [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), and Drug Interactions ( 7 )].

The empirical formula is C 17 H 21 NO 4 and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55-7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.2 mm thick, 2.5 cm 2 film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film; (2) a drug layer of scopolamine, crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, and polyisobutylene; (3) an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) an contact layer formulation of crospovidone, isopropyl palmitate, light mineral oil, polyisobutylene, and scopolamine. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. Cross section of the system:"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Endogenous androgens, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of prostate, seminal vesicles, penis and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement; vocal chord thickening; and alterations in body musculature and fat distribution. Testosterone and DHT are necessary for the normal development of secondary sex characteristics. Male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from insufficient secretion of testosterone, has two main etiologies. Primary hypogonadism is caused by defects of the gonads, such as Klinefelter's syndrome or Leydig cell aplasia, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins (FSH, LH). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted using testosterone gel 1.62%. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Testosterone gel 1.62% delivers physiologic amounts of testosterone, producing circulating testosterone concentrations that approximate normal levels (300 \u2013 1000 ng/dL) seen in healthy men. Testosterone gel 1.62% provides continuous transdermal delivery of testosterone for 24 hours following once daily application to clean, dry, intact skin of the shoulders and upper arms. Average serum testosterone concentrations over 24 hours (C avg ) observed when testosterone gel 1.62% was applied to the upper arms/shoulders were comparable to average serum testosterone concentrations (C avg ) when testosterone gel 1.62% was applied using a rotation method utilizing the abdomen and upper arms/shoulders. The rotation of abdomen and upper arms/shoulders was a method used in the pivotal clinical trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Figure 2: Mean (\u00b1SD) Serum Total Testosterone Concentrations on Day 7 in Patients Following Testosterone Gel 1.62% Once-Daily Application of 81 mg of Testosterone (N=33) for 7 Days Distribution Circulating testosterone is primarily bound in the serum to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Approximately 40% of testosterone in plasma is bound to SHBG, 2% remains unbound (free) and the rest is loosely bound to albumin and other proteins. Metabolism Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways. The major active metabolites of testosterone are estradiol and DHT. Excretion There is considerable variation in the half-life of testosterone concentration as reported in the literature, ranging from 10 to 100 minutes. About 90% of a dose of testosterone given intramuscularly is excreted in the urine as glucuronic acid and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites. About 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver. When testosterone gel 1.62% treatment is discontinued, serum testosterone concentrations return to approximately baseline concentrations within 48-72 hours after administration of the last dose. Potential for testosterone transfer The potential for testosterone transfer following administration of testosterone gel 1.62% when it was applied only to upper arms/shoulders was evaluated in two clinical studies of males dosed with testosterone gel 1.62% and their untreated female partners. In one study, 8 male subjects applied a single dose of testosterone gel 1.62% 81 mg to their shoulders and upper arms. Two (2) hours after application, female subjects rubbed their hands, wrists, arms, and shoulders to the application site of the male subjects for 15 minutes. Serum concentrations of testosterone were monitored in female subjects for 24 hours after contact occurred. After direct skin-to-skin contact with the site of application, mean testosterone C avg and C max in female subjects increased by 280% and 267%, respectively, compared to mean baseline testosterone concentrations. In a second study evaluating transfer of testosterone, 12 male subjects applied a single dose of testosterone gel 1.62% 81 mg to their shoulders and upper arms. Two (2) hours after application, female subjects rubbed their hands, wrists, arms, and shoulders to the application site of the male subjects for 15 minutes while the site of application was covered by a t-shirt. When a t-shirt was used to cover the site of application, mean testosterone C avg and C max in female subjects increased by 6% and 11%, respectively, compared to mean baseline testosterone concentrations. A separate study was conducted to evaluate the potential for testosterone transfer from 16 males dosed with testosterone gel 1.62% 81 mg when it was applied to abdomen only for 7 days, a site of application not approved for testosterone gel 1.62%. Two (2) hours after application to the males on each day, the female subjects rubbed their abdomens for 15 minutes to the abdomen of the males. The males had covered the application area with a T-shirt. The mean testosterone C avg and C max in female subjects on day 1 increased by 43% and 47%, respectively, compared to mean baseline testosterone concentrations.

On the 7th day of each treatment period, hypogonadal men took a shower with soap and water at either 2, 6, or 10 hours after drug application. The effect of showering at 2 or 6 hours post-dose on Day 7 resulted in 13% and 12% decreases in mean C avg , respectively, compared to Day 6 when no shower was taken after drug application. Showering at 10 hours after drug application had no effect on bioavailability. The amount of testosterone remaining in the outer layers of the skin at the application site on the 7th day was assessed using a tape stripping procedure and was reduced by at least 80% after showering 2-10 hours post-dose compared to on the 6th day when no shower was taken after drug application. Effect of hand washing In a randomized, open-label, single-dose, 2-way crossover study in 16 healthy male subjects, the effect of hand washing on the amount of residual testosterone on the hands was evaluated. Subjects used their hands to apply the maximum dose (81 mg testosterone) of testosterone gel 1.62% to their upper arms and shoulders. Within 1 minute of applying the gel, subjects either washed or did not wash their hands prior to study personnel wiping the subjects\u2019 hands with ethanol dampened gauze pads. The gauze pads were then analyzed for residual testosterone content. A mean (SD) of 0.1 (0.04) mg of residual testosterone (0.12% of the actual applied dose of testosterone, and a 96% reduction compared to when hands were not washed) was recovered after washing hands with water and soap.

The backing layer is composed of a peach flexible film consisting of a pigmented polyethylene outer layer and a polyester inner layer. It provides structural support and protects the middle adhesive layer from the environment. The middle layer contains crospovidone, lauryl lactate, polyisobutylene/polybutene adhesive and non-woven polyester fabric as inactive components. The active components in this layer are the hormones, NGMN and EE. The third layer is the release liner , which protects the adhesive layer during storage and is removed just prior to application. It is a transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film with a polydimethylsiloxane coating on the side that is in contact with the middle adhesive layer. The outside of the backing layer is printed with \"Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol 150/35 mcg per day\" in red ink. Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system is packaged with additional piece of protective film above the system within each pouch. This piece of protective film is removed and discarded at the time of use. The structural formulas of the components are: Molecular weight, NGMN: 327.47 Molecular weight, EE: 296.41 Chemical name for NGMN: 18, 19-dinorpregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one, 13-ethyl-, 17-hydroxy, 3-oxime, (17\u03b1)- Chemical name for EE: 19-Norpregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3, 17\u03b2-diol, (17\u03b1)- structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action NGMN is the active progestin largely responsible for the progestational activity that occurs in women following application of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system. NGMN is also the primary active metabolite produced following oral administration of NGM, the progestin component of some oral contraceptive products. Combination hormonal contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics One clinical trial assessed the return of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function post-therapy and found that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol mean values, though suppressed during therapy, returned to near baseline values during the 6 weeks post-therapy. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The systemic delivery rate of NGMN and EE from norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system is approximately 150 mcg of NGMN and 35 mcg of EE per day based on a comparative analysis with intravenous (IV) data. Following a single application of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system, both NGMN and EE reach a plateau by approximately 48 hours. Pooled data from the 3 clinical studies have demonstrated that steady state is reached within 2 weeks of application. In one of the clinical studies, C ss concentrations across all subjects ranged from 0.305 to 1.53 ng/mL for NGMN and from 23 to 137 pg/mL for EE. Absorption of NGMN and EE following application of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system to the buttock, upper outer arm, abdomen and upper torso (excluding breast) was examined. While absorption from the abdomen was slightly lower than from other sites, absorption from these anatomic sites was considered to be therapeutically equivalent. The mean (%CV) PK parameters C ss and AUC 0-168 for NGMN and EE following a single buttock application of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system are summarized in Table 5. In multiple dose studies, AUC 0-168 for NGMN and EE was found to increase over time (Table 5). In a three-cycle study, these PK parameters reached steady state conditions during Cycle 3 (Figures 3 and 4). Upon removal of the patch, serum levels of EE and NGMN reach very low or non-measurable levels within 3 days.

The absorption of NGMN and EE following application of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system was studied under conditions encountered in a health club (sauna, whirlpool and treadmill) and in a cold water bath. The results indicated that for NGMN, there were no significant treatment effects on C ss or AUC when compared to normal wear. For EE, increased exposures were observed due to sauna, whirlpool and treadmill. There was no significant effect of cold water on these parameters. Results from a study of consecutive norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system wear for 7 days and 10 days indicated that serum concentrations of NGMN and EE dropped slightly during the first 6 hours after the patch replacement, and recovered within 12 hours. By Day 10 of patch administration, both NGMN and EE concentrations had decreased by approximately 25% when compared to Day 7 concentrations. Metabolism Since NGMN and EE are delivered transdermally, first-pass metabolism (via the gastrointestinal tract and/or liver) of NGMN and EE that would be expected with oral administration does not occur. Hepatic metabolism of NGMN occurs and metabolites include norgestrel, which is highly bound to SHBG, and various hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites. EE is also metabolized to various hydroxylated products and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Distribution NGMN and norgestrel (a serum metabolite of NGMN) are highly bound (> 97%) to serum proteins. NGMN is bound to albumin and not to SHBG, while norgestrel is bound primarily to SHBG, which limits its biological activity. EE is extensively bound to serum albumin and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of SHBG (see Table 5). Elimination Following removal of patches, the elimination kinetics of NGMN and EE were consistent for all studies with half-life values of approximately 28 hours and 17 hours, respectively. The metabolites of NGMN and EE are eliminated by renal and fecal pathways. Transdermal versus Oral Contraceptives The norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system delivers EE and NGMN over a 7-day period while oral contraceptives (containing NGM 250 mcg / EE 35 mcg) are administered on a daily basis. Figures 5 and 6 present mean PK profiles for EE and NGMN following administration of an oral contraceptive (containing NGM 250 mcg / EE 35 mcg) compared to the 7-day norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system (containing NGMN 4.678 mg / EE 0.53 mg) during Cycle 2 in 32 healthy female volunteers.

Under steady state conditions, AUC 0-168 and C ss for EE were approximately 55% and 60% higher, respectively, for the transdermal patch, and the C max was about 35% higher for the oral contraceptive, respectively. Inter-subject variability (%CV) for the PK parameters following delivery from norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system was higher relative to the variability determined from the oral contraceptive. The mean PK profiles are different between the two products and caution should be exercised when making a direct comparison of these PK parameters. In Table 7, percent change in concentrations (%CV) of markers of systemic estrogenic activity (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin [SHBG] and Corticosteroid Binding Globulin [CBG]) from Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 1 Day 22 is presented. Percent change in SHBG concentrations was higher for norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system users compared to women taking the oral contraceptive; percent change in CBG concentrations was similar for norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system and oral contraceptive users. Within each group, the absolute values for SHBG were similar for Cycle 1, Day 22 and Cycle 2, Day 22. Table 7: Mean Percent Change (%CV) in SHBG and CBG Concentrations Following Once-Daily Administration of an Oral Contraceptive (containing NGM 250 mcg / EE 35 mcg) for One Cycle and Application of Norelgestromin and Ethinyl Estradiol Transdermal System for One Cycle in Healthy Female Volunteers Parameter Norelgestrmin and Ethinyl Estradiol Transdermal System ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE (% change from Day 1 to Day 22) (% change from Day 1 to Day 22) SHBG 334 (39.3) 200 (43.2) CBG 153 (40.2) 157 (33.4) Drug Interactions In a PK drug interaction study, oral administration of tetracycline HCl, 500 mg four times daily for 3 days prior to and 7 days during wear of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system did not significantly affect the PK of NGMN or EE. Use in Specific Populations Effects of Age, Body Weight, Body Surface Area and Race The effects of age, body weight, body surface area and race on the PK of NGMN and EE were evaluated in 230 healthy women from nine pharmacokinetic studies of single 7-day applications of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system. For both NGMN and EE, increasing age, body weight and body surface area each were associated with slight decreases in C ss and AUC values. However, only a small fraction (10% to 25%) of the overall variability in the PK of NGMN and EE following application of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system may be associated with any or all of the above demographic parameters. There was no significant effect of race with respect to Caucasians, Hispanics and Blacks. figure3 figure4 figure5 figure6"], "manufacturer_name": ["Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc."], "substance_name": ["ETHINYL ESTRADIOL", "NORELGESTROMIN"], "effective_time": "20241127", "product_ndc": ["70710-1190"], "brand_name": ["norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol"]}

Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, acetone, and ethyl acetate and very slightly soluble in water. Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of Trubrexa TM Transdermal Patch is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Capsaicin is an agonist for the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1), which is an ion channel-receptor complex expressed on nociceptive nerve fibers in the skin. Topical administration of capsaicin causes an initial enhanced stimulation of the TRPV1-expressing cutaneous nociceptors that may be associated with painful sensations. This is followed by pain relief thought to be mediated by a reduction in TRPV1-expressing nociceptive nerve endings. 10.2 Pharmacokinetics The amount of lidocaine and capsaicin systemically absorbed from Trubrexa TM Transdermal Patch is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. Systemic exposure decreases upon removal of Trubrexa TM Transdermal Patch. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion.

Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days. Absorption Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers. Distribution The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours.

C max increased by nearly 69% and 100% within 4 weeks of daily administration of the starting dose in children and adolescents, respectively. The observed exposures with methylphenidate transdermal system could not be explained by drug accumulation predicted from observed single dose pharmacokinetics and there was no evidence that clearance or rate of elimination changed between single and repeat dosing. Neither were they explainable by differences in dosing patterns between treatments, age, race, or gender. This suggests that transdermal absorption of methylphenidate may increase with repeat dosing with methylphenidate transdermal system; on average, steady-state is likely to have been achieved by approximately 14 days of dosing. In the single- and multiple dose study described above, exposure to l -methylphenidate was 46% of the exposure to d -methylphenidate in children and 40% in adolescents. l -methylphenidate is less pharmacologically active than d -methylphenidate [see Pharmacodynamics (12.2) ] . In a phase 2 PK/PD study in children aged 6-12 years, 2/3 of patients had 2-hour d -MPH concentrations < 5 ng/mL on chronic dosing, and at 3 hours 40% of patients had d -MPH concentrations < 5 ng/mL [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . When methylphenidate transdermal system is applied to inflamed skin both the rate and extent of absorption are increased as compared with intact skin. When applied to inflamed skin, lag time is no greater than 1 hour, T max is 4 hours, and both C max and AUC are approximately 3-fold higher. When heat is applied to methylphenidate transdermal system after application, both the rate and the extent of absorption are significantly increased. Median T lag occurs 1 hour earlier, T max occurs 0.5 hours earlier, and median C max and AUC are 2-fold and 2.5-fold higher, respectively. Application sites other than the hip can have different absorption characteristics and have not been adequately studied in safety or efficacy studies. Dose Proportionality Following a single 9-hour application of methylphenidate transdermal system doses of 10 mg/9 hours to 30 mg/9 hours transdermal systems to 34 children with ADHD, C max and AUC 0-t of d -methylphenidate were proportional to the transdermal system dose. Mean plasma concentration-time plots are shown in Figure 1. C max of l -methylphenidate was also proportional to the transdermal system dose. AUC 0-t of l -methylphenidate was only slightly greater than proportional to transdermal system dose. FIGURE 1: Mean Concentration-time Profiles for d-Methylphenidate in all Patients (N = 34) Following Administration of Single Applications (9-Hour Wear Time) of d,l-Methylphenidate Using Methylphenidate Transdermal System 10 mg (\u25a1), 20 mg (\u25ca) and 30 mg (\u0394) per 9-Hour Transdermal System Figure 1 Distribution Upon removal of methylphenidate transdermal system, methylphenidate plasma concentrations in children with ADHD decline in a biexponential manner. This may be due to continued distribution of MPH from the skin after transdermal system removal. Metabolism and Excretion Methylphenidate is metabolized primarily by de-esterification to alpha-phenyl-piperidine acetic acid (ritalinic acid), which has little or no pharmacologic activity. Transdermal administration of methylphenidate exhibits much less first pass effect than oral administration. Consequently, a much lower dose of methylphenidate transdermal system on a mg/kg basis compared to oral dosages may still produce higher exposures of d -MPH with transdermal administration compared to oral administration. In addition, very little, if any, l -methylphenidate is systemically available after oral administration due to first pass metabolism, whereas after transdermal administration of racemic methylphenidate exposure to l -methylphenidate is nearly as high as to d -methylphenidate. The mean elimination t 1/2 from plasma of d -methylphenidate after removal of methylphenidate transdermal system in children aged 6 to 12 years and adolescents aged 13-17 years was approximately 4 to 5 hours. The t 1/2 of l -methylphenidate was shorter than for d -methylphenidate and ranged from 1.4 to 2.9 hours, on average. The C max and AUC of d -methylphenidate were approximately 50% lower in adolescents, compared to children, following either a 1-day or 7-day administration of methylphenidate transdermal system (10 mg/9 hr). Multiple-dose administration of methylphenidate transdermal system did not result in significant accumulation of methylphenidate; following 7 days of methylphenidate transdermal system administration (10 mg/9 hr) in children and adolescents, the accumulation index of methylphenidate was 1.1, based on the mean steady state area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC ss ) relative to that anticipated on the basis of single dose pharmacokinetics (AUC 0-\u221e ). Food Effects The pharmacokinetics or the pharmacodynamic food effect performance after application of methylphenidate transdermal system has not been studied, but because of the transdermal route of administration, no food effect is expected. Special Populations Gender The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after single and repeated doses of methylphenidate transdermal system were similar between boys and girls with ADHD, after allowance for differences in body weight. Race The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after administration of methylphenidate transdermal system has not been defined. Age The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after administration of methylphenidate transdermal system have not been studied in children less than 6 years of age.

Chemical structure diagram patch"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women. Levonorgestrel inhibits gonadotropin production resulting in retardation of follicular growth and inhibition of ovulation. Studies to assess the potency of progestins using estrogen-primed postmenopausal endometrial biochemistry and morphologic features have shown that levonorgestrel counteracts the proliferative effects of estrogens on the endometrium. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman\u2019s therapeutic response to Climara nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Transdermal administration of Climara Pro produces mean maximum estradiol concentrations in serum in about 2 to 2.5 days. Estradiol concentrations equivalent to the normal ranges observed at the early follicular phase in premenopausal women are achieved within 12\u201324 hours after the first application. In one study, steady state estradiol concentrations in serum were measured during week 4 in 44 healthy, postmenopausal women during four consecutive Climara Pro applications of two formulations (0.045 mg estradiol/0.03 mg levonorgestrel and 0.045 mg estradiol/0.015 mg levonorgestrel) to the abdomen (each dose was applied for four 7-day periods). Both formulations were bioequivalent in terms of estradiol and estrone C max and AUC parameters. A summary of Climara Pro single and multiple applications estradiol, estrone and levonorgestrel pharmacokinetic parameters is shown in Table 2.

Figure 2: Mean Levonorgestrel Concentration Profile (Week 4) Following Four Consecutive Weekly Applications of Climara Pro figure 1 Figure 2 Adhesion A study of the adhesion potential of Climara Pro was conducted in 104 healthy women of 45\u201375 years of age. Each woman applied a placebo patch, containing only the Climara Pro adhesive without active ingredient, to the upper outer abdominal areas weekly for three weeks. The adhesion assessment was done visually on Days 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of each of the three weeks using a four-point scale. The mean scores ranked in the highest category possible on the 0 to 4 scale demonstrating clinically acceptable adhesion performance Excretion Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Following patch removal, serum estradiol concentrations decline with a mean (\u00b1 SD) terminal half-life of 3\u00b1 0.67 hours. Levonorgestrel and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Mean (\u00b1 SD) terminal half-life for levonorgestrel was determined to be 28 \u00b1 6.4 hours. Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens. The most important metabolic pathway for levonorgestrel occurs in the reduction of the \u03944- and the 3-oxo-group as well as hydroxylations at positions 2\u03b1, 1\u03b2, and 16\u03b2, followed by conjugation. Most of the metabolites that circulate in the blood are sulfates of 3\u03b1, 5\u03b2-tetrahydro-levonorgestrel, while excretion occurs predominantly in the form of glucuronides. Some of the parent levonorgestrel also circulates as the 17\u03b2-sulfate. In-vitro studies on the biotransformation of levonorgestrel in human skin did not indicate any significant metabolism of levonorgestrel during skin penetration. Distribution The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin. Levonorgestrel in serum is bound to both SHBG and albumin. Following four consecutive weekly applications of Climara Pro mean (\u00b1 SD) SHBG concentrations declined from a predose value of 47.5 (25.8) to 41.2 (22.4) nmol/L at week 4."], "manufacturer_name": ["Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "substance_name": ["ESTRADIOL", "LEVONORGESTREL"], "effective_time": "20231206", "product_ndc": ["50419-491"], "brand_name": ["Climara Pro"]}

The chemical name of buprenorphine is (5R,6R,7R,9R,13S,14S)-17-Cyclopropylmethyl-7-[(S)-3,3-dimethyl-2-hydroxybutan-2-yl]-6-methoxy-4,5-epoxy-6,14-ethanomorphinan-3-ol. The structural formula is: The molecular weight of buprenorphine is 467.64; the empirical formula is C 29 H 41 NO 4 . Buprenorphine occurs as a white or almost white crystalline powder and is very slightly soluble in water, freely soluble in acetone, soluble in methanol, and slightly soluble in cyclohexane. It dissolves in dilute solutions of acids. The pKa is 8.35 and the melting point is about 217\u00b0C. System Components and Structure Five different strengths of buprenorphine transdermal system are available: 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 mcg/hour (Table 6). The proportion of buprenorphine mixed in the adhesive matrix is the same in each of the five strengths. The amount of buprenorphine released from each system per hour is proportional to the active surface area of the system. The skin is the limiting barrier to diffusion from the system into the bloodstream.

The inactive ingredients in each system are: levulinic acid, oleyl oleate, povidone, and polyacrylate cross-linked with aluminum. structure fig1"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptors, an agonist at delta-opioid receptors, and a partial agonist at ORL-1 (nociceptin) receptors. The contributions of these actions to its analgesic profile are unclear. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Buprenorphine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brainstem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brainstem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Buprenorphine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with worsening hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Buprenorphine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Buprenorphine produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour and 2 x buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour on QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind (buprenorphine transdermal system vs. placebo), randomized, placebo and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg, open label), parallel-group, dose-escalating, single-dose study in 132 healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 55 years. The dose escalation sequence for buprenorphine transdermal system during the titration period was: Buprenorphine transdermal system 5 mcg/hour for 3 days, then buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour for 3 days, then buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour for 3 days, then 2 x buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour for 4 days. The QTc evaluation was performed during the third day of buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour and the fourth day of 2 x buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour when the plasma levels of buprenorphine were at steady state for the corresponding doses [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.17 )] . There was no clinically meaningful effect on mean QTc with a buprenorphine transdermal system dose of 10 mcg/hour. A buprenorphine transdermal system dose of 40 mcg/hour (given as two 20 mcg/hour buprenorphine transdermal system) prolonged mean QTc by a maximum of 9.2 (90% CI: 5.2-13.3) msec across the 13 assessment time points. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of buprenorphine for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.4 )] . Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing buprenorphine plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.3 , 2.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Each buprenorphine transdermal system provides delivery of buprenorphine for 7 days. Steady state was achieved during the first application by Day 3 (see Figure 2). Figure 2 Mean (SD) Buprenorphine Plasma Concentrations Following Three Consecutive Applications of Buprenorphine Transdermal System 10 mcg/hour (N = 36 Healthy Subjects) Buprenorphine transdermal system 5, 10, and 20 mcg/hour provide dose-proportional total buprenorphine exposures (AUC) following 7-day applications. Buprenorphine transdermal system single 7-day application and steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table 7. Plasma buprenorphine concentrations after titration showed no further change over the 60-day period studied.

In clinical pharmacology studies, the median time for buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour to deliver quantifiable buprenorphine concentrations (\u2265 25 pg/mL) was approximately 17 hours. The absolute bioavailability of buprenorphine transdermal system relative to IV administration, following a 7-day application, is approximately 15% for all doses (buprenorphine transdermal system 5, 10, and 20 mcg/hour). Effects of Application Site A study in healthy subjects demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic profile of buprenorphine delivered by buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour is similar when applied to the upper outer arm, upper chest, upper back, or the side of the chest [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. The reapplication of buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour after various rest periods to the same application site in healthy subjects showed that the minimum rest period needed to avoid variability in drug absorption is 3 weeks (21 days) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . Effects of Heat In a study of healthy subjects, application of a heating pad directly on the buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour system caused a 26% to 55% increase in blood concentrations of buprenorphine. Concentrations returned to normal within 5 hours after the heat was removed. For this reason, instruct patients not to apply heating pads directly to the buprenorphine transdermal system during system wear [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Fever may increase the permeability of the skin, leading to increased buprenorphine concentrations during buprenorphine transdermal system treatment. As a result, febrile patients are at increased risk for the possibility of buprenorphine transdermal system-related reactions during treatment with buprenorphine transdermal system. Monitor patients with febrile illness for adverse effects and consider dose adjustment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . In a crossover study of healthy subjects receiving endotoxin or placebo challenge during buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour wear, the AUC and C max were similar despite a physiologic response of mild fever to endotoxin. Distribution Buprenorphine is approximately 96% bound to plasma proteins, mainly to alpha- and beta-globulin. Studies of IV buprenorphine have shown a large volume of distribution (approximately 430 L), implying extensive distribution of buprenorphine. CSF buprenorphine concentrations appear to be approximately 15 to 25% of concurrent plasma concentrations. Elimination Metabolism Buprenorphine metabolism in the skin following buprenorphine transdermal system application is negligible. Buprenorphine primarily undergoes N -dealkylation by CYP3A4 to norbuprenorphine and glucuronidation by UGT-isoenzymes (mainly UGT1A1 and 2B7) to buprenorphine 3\u03b2- O -glucuronide. Norbuprenorphine, the major metabolite, is also glucuronidated (mainly UGT1A3) prior to excretion. Norbuprenorphine is the only known active metabolite of buprenorphine. It has been shown to be a respiratory depressant in rats, but only at concentrations at least 50-fold greater than those observed following application to humans of buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour. Excretion Following IV administration, buprenorphine and its metabolites are secreted into bile and excreted in urine. Following intramuscular administration of 2 mcg/kg dose of buprenorphine, approximately 70% of the dose was excreted in feces within 7 days. Approximately 27% was excreted in urine. Following transdermal application, buprenorphine is eliminated via hepatic metabolism, with subsequent biliary excretion and renal excretion of soluble metabolites. After removal of buprenorphine transdermal system, mean buprenorphine concentrations decrease approximately 50% within 10 to 24 hours, followed by decline with an apparent terminal half-life of approximately 26 hours. Since metabolism and excretion of buprenorphine occur mainly via hepatic elimination, reductions in hepatic blood flow induced by some general anesthetics (e.g., halothane) and other drugs may result in a decreased rate of hepatic elimination of the drug, leading to increased plasma concentrations. The total clearance of buprenorphine is approximately 55 L/hour in postoperative patients. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors In a drug-drug interaction study, buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour (single dose x 7 days) was coadministered with 200 mg ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or ketoconazole placebo twice daily for 11 days and the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and its metabolites were evaluated. Plasma buprenorphine concentrations did not accumulate during co-medication with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily. Based on the results from this study, metabolism during therapy with buprenorphine transdermal system is not expected to be affected by co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Antiretroviral agents have been evaluated for CYP3A4 mediated interactions with sublingual buprenorphine. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) do not appear to have clinically significant interactions with buprenorphine. However, certain protease inhibitors (PIs) with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity such as atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir resulted in elevated levels of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine when buprenorphine and naloxone were administered sublingually. C max and AUC for buprenorphine increased by up to 1.6 and 1.9 fold, and C max and AUC for norbuprenorphine increased by up to 1.6 and 2.0 fold respectively, when sublingual buprenorphine was administered with these PIs. Patients in this study reported increased sedation, and symptoms of opiate excess have been found in post-marketing reports of patients receiving buprenorphine and atazanavir with and without ritonavir concomitantly. It should be noted that atazanavir is both a CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inhibitor. As such, the drug-drug interaction potential for buprenorphine with CYP3A4 inhibitors is likely to be dependent on the route of administration as well as the specificity of enzyme inhibition [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Effect of CYP3A4 Inducers The interaction between buprenorphine and CYP3A4 inducers has not been studied. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Patients Following a single application of buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour to 12 healthy young adults (mean age 32 years) and 12 healthy elderly subjects (mean age 72 years), the pharmacokinetic profile of buprenorphine transdermal system was similar in healthy elderly and healthy young adult subjects, though the elderly subjects showed a trend toward higher plasma concentrations immediately after buprenorphine transdermal system removal. Both groups eliminated buprenorphine at similar rates after system removal [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . In a study of healthy young subjects, healthy elderly subjects, and elderly subjects treated with thiazide diuretics, buprenorphine transdermal system at a fixed dose-escalation schedule (buprenorphine transdermal system 5 mcg/hour for 3 days, followed by buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour for 3 days and buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour for 7 days) produced similar mean plasma concentration vs. time profiles for each of the three subject groups. There were no significant differences between groups in buprenorphine C max or AUC [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Sex In a pooled data analysis utilizing data from several studies that administered buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour to healthy subjects, no differences in buprenorphine C max and AUC or body-weight normalized C max and AUC were observed between males and females treated with buprenorphine transdermal system. Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine following an IV infusion of 0.3 mg of buprenorphine were compared in 8 patients with mild impairment (Child-Pugh A), 4 patients with moderate impairment (Child-Pugh B) and 12 subjects with normal hepatic function. Buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine exposure did not increase in the mild and moderate hepatic impairment patients. Buprenorphine transdermal system has not been evaluated in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Renal Impairment No studies in patients with renal impairment have been performed with buprenorphine transdermal system. In an independent study, the effect of impaired renal function on buprenorphine pharmacokinetics after IV bolus and after continuous IV infusion administrations was evaluated. It was found that plasma buprenorphine concentrations were similar in patients with normal renal function and in patients with impaired renal function or renal failure. In a separate investigation of the effect of intermittent hemodialysis on buprenorphine plasma concentrations in chronic pain patients with end-stage renal disease who were treated with a transdermal buprenorphine product (marketed outside the US) up to 70 mcg/hour, no significant differences in buprenorphine plasma concentrations before or after hemodialysis were observed. No notable relationship was observed between estimated creatinine clearance rates and steady-state buprenorphine concentrations among patients during buprenorphine transdermal system therapy. fig2"], "manufacturer_name": ["INGENUS PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC"], "substance_name": ["BUPRENORPHINE"], "effective_time": "20241120", "product_ndc": ["50742-372", "50742-373", "50742-374", "50742-375", "50742-376"], "brand_name": ["Buprenorphine"]}
