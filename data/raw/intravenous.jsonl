Lacosamide is a functionalized amino acid. Its molecular formula is C 13 H 18 N 2 O 3 and its molecular weight is 250.30. The chemical structure is: Lacosamide is a white to light yellow powder. It is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in acetonitrile and ethanol. 11.2 Lacosamide Injection Lacosamide injection, USP is a clear, colorless, sterile solution containing 10 mg lacosamide per mL for intravenous infusion. One 20-mL vial contains 200 mg of lacosamide drug substance. The inactive ingredients are sodium chloride (7.62 mg/mL) and water for injection. Hydrochloric acid is used for pH adjustment. Lacosamide injection, USP has a pH of 3.8 to 5.0. Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be fully elucidated. In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data from the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. Lacosamide exposure is correlated with the reduction in seizure frequency. However, doses above 400 mg/day do not appear to confer additional benefit in group analyses. Cardiac Electrophysiology Electrocardiographic effects of lacosamide were determined in a double-blind, randomized clinical pharmacology trial of 247 healthy subjects. Chronic oral doses of 400 and 800 mg/day (equal to and two times the maximum daily recommended dose, respectively) were compared with placebo and a positive control (400 mg moxifloxacin). Lacosamide did not prolong QTc interval and did not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. Lacosamide produced a small, dose-related increase in mean PR interval. At steady-state, the time of the maximum observed mean PR interval corresponded with tmax. The placebo-subtracted maximum increase in PR interval (at tmax) was 7.3 ms for the 400 mg/day group and 11.9 ms for the 800 mg/day group. For patients who participated in the controlled trials, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum increase in PR interval for a 400 mg/day lacosamide dose was 3.1 ms in patients with partial-onset seizures and 9.4 ms for patients with diabetic neuropathy. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide have been studied in healthy adult subjects (age range 18 to 87), adults with partial-onset seizures, adults with diabetic neuropathy, and subjects with renal and hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide are similar in healthy subjects, patients with partial-onset seizures, and patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass effect with a high absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. The maximum lacosamide plasma concentrations occur approximately 1-to-4-hour post-dose after oral dosing, and elimination half-life is approximately 13 hours. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice daily repeated administration. Pharmacokinetics of lacosamide are dose proportional (100-800 mg) and time invariant, with low inter- and intra-subject variability. Compared to lacosamide the major metabolite, O-desmethyl metabolite, has a longer Tmax (0.5 to 12 hours) and elimination half-life (15-23 hours). Absorption and Bioavailability Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration. The oral bioavailability of lacosamide tablets is approximately 100%. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption. After intravenous administration, C max is reached at the end of infusion. The 30- and 60-minute intravenous infusions are bioequivalent to the oral tablet. For the 15-minute intravenous infusion, bioequivalence was met for AUC (0-tz) but not for C max . The point estimate of C max was 20% higher than C max for oral tablet and the 90% CI for C max exceeded the upper boundary of the bioequivalence range. In a trial comparing the oral tablet with an oral solution containing 10 mg/mL lacosamide, bioequivalence between both formulations was shown. A single loading dose of 200 mg approximates steady-state concentrations comparable to the 100 mg twice daily oral administration. Distribution The volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/kg and thus close to the volume of total body water. Lacosamide is less than 15% bound to plasma proteins. Metabolism and Elimination Lacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation. After intravenous administration of 100 mg [14C]-lacosamide approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces. The major compounds excreted were unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose), its O-desmethyl metabolite (approximately 30%), and a structurally unknown polar fraction (~20%). The plasma exposure of the major human metabolite, O- desmethyl-lacosamide, is approximately 10% of that of lacosamide. This metabolite has no known pharmacological activity. The CYP isoforms mainly responsible for the formation of the major metabolite (O-desmethyl) are CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours and is not altered by different doses, multiple dosing or intravenous administration. There is no enantiomeric interconversion of lacosamide. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Lacosamide and its major metabolite are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion. The AUC of lacosamide was increased approximately 25% in mildly (CL CR 50-80 mL/min) and moderately (CL CR 30-50 mL/min) and 60% in severely (CL CR \u226430 mL/min) renally impaired patients compared to subjects with normal renal function (CL CR >80 mL/min), whereas C max was unaffected. Lacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis. Following a 4-hour hemodialysis treatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50% [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Hepatic Impairment Lacosamide undergoes metabolism. Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of lacosamide (approximately 50-60% higher AUC compared to healthy subjects). The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide have not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Pediatric Patients (4 Years to less than 17 Years of Age) The pediatric pharmacokinetic profile of lacosamide was determined in a population pharmacokinetic analysis using sparse plasma concentration data obtained in two open-label studies in 79 pediatric patients with partial-onset seizures that included patients 4 years to less than 17 years of age. A weight based dosing regimen is necessary to achieve lacosamide exposures in pediatric patients 4 years to less than 17 years of age similar to those observed in adults treated at effective doses of lacosamide [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. For patients weighing 11 kg, 28.9 kg (the mean population body weight), and 70 kg, the typical plasma half-life (t1/2) is 7.4 hours, 10.6 hours, and 14.8 hours, respectively. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice daily repeated administration. The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide in pediatric patients are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures and as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Pediatric use information is approved for UCB, Inc.'s VIMPAT\u00ae (lacosamide) injection. However, due to UCB, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Geriatric Patients In the elderly (>65 years), dose and body-weight normalized AUC and C max is about 20% increased compared to young subjects (18-64 years). This may be related to body weight and decreased renal function in elderly subjects. Gender Lacosamide clinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically relevant influence on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide. Race There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide between Asian, Black, and Caucasian subjects. CYP2C19 Polymorphism There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide between CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers. Results from a trial in poor metabolizers (PM) (N=4) and extensive metabolizers (EM) (N=8) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 showed that lacosamide plasma concentrations were similar in PMs and EMs, but plasma concentrations and the amount excreted into urine of the O-desmethyl metabolite were about 70% reduced in PMs compared to EMs. Drug Interactions In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In vitro metabolism studies indicate that lacosamide does not induce the enzyme activity of drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4. Lacosamide did not inhibit CYP 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5 at plasma concentrations observed in clinical studies. In vitro data suggest that lacosamide has the potential to inhibit CYP2C19 at therapeutic concentrations. However, an in vivo study with omeprazole did not show an inhibitory effect on omeprazole pharmacokinetics. Lacosamide was not a substrate or inhibitor for P-glycoprotein. Lacosamide is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have increased exposure to lacosamide. Since <15% of lacosamide is bound to plasma proteins, a clinically relevant interaction with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites is unlikely. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with AEDs \u25cb Effect of lacosamide on concomitant AEDs Lacosamide 400 mg/day had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of 600 mg/day valproic acid and 400 mg/day carbamazepine in healthy subjects. The placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients with partial-onset seizures showed that steady-state plasma concentrations of levetiracetam, carbamazepine, carbamazepine epoxide, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine monohydroxy derivative (MHD), phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, gabapentin, clonazepam, and zonisamide were not affected by concomitant intake of lacosamide at any dose. \u25cb Effect of concomitant AEDs on lacosamide Drug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects showed that 600 mg/day valproic acid had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of 400 mg/day lacosamide. Likewise, 400 mg/day carbamazepine had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide in a healthy subject study. Population pharmacokinetics results in patients with partial-onset seizures showed small reductions (15% to 20% lower) in lacosamide plasma concentrations when lacosamide was coadministered with carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin. Drug-drug interaction studies with other drugs \u25cb Digoxin There was no effect of lacosamide (400 mg/day) on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.5 mg once daily) in a study in healthy subjects. \u25cb Metformin There were no clinically relevant changes in metformin levels following coadministration of lacosamide (400 mg/day). Metformin (500 mg three times a day) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide (400 mg/day). \u25cb Omeprazole Omeprazole is a CYP2C19 substrate and inhibitor. There was no effect of lacosamide (600 mg/day) on the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole (40 mg single dose) in healthy subjects. The data indicated that lacosamide had little in vivo inhibitory or inducing effect on CYP2C19. Omeprazole at a dose of 40 mg once daily had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide(300 mg single dose). However, plasma levels of the O-desmethyl metabolite were reduced about 60% in the presence of omeprazole. \u25cb Midazolam Midazolam is a 3A4 substrate. There was no effect of lacosamide (200 mg single dose or repeat doses of 400 mg/day given as 200 mg BID) on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (single dose, 7.5 mg), indicating no inhibitory or inducing effects on CYP3A4. \u25cb Oral Contraceptives There was no influence of lacosamide (400 mg/day) on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel in healthy subjects, except that a 20% increase in ethinylestradiol C max was observed. \u25cb Warfarin Co-administration of lacosamide (400 mg/day) with warfarin (25 mg single dose) did not result in a clinically relevant change in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin in a study in healthy male subjects."], "manufacturer_name": ["Somerset Therapeutics, LLC"], "substance_name": ["LACOSAMIDE"], "effective_time": "20241016", "product_ndc": ["70069-471"], "brand_name": ["LACOSAMIDE"]}

Eculizumab products inhibit terminal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients and complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in patients with aHUS. The precise mechanism by which eculizumab exerts its therapeutic effect in gMG patients is unknown, but is presumed to involve reduction of terminal complement complex C5b-9 deposition at the neuromuscular junction. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In the placebo-controlled clinical study (PNH Study 1), eculizumab when administered as recommended reduced serum LDH levels from 2200 \u00b1 1034 U/L (mean \u00b1 SD) at baseline to 700 \u00b1 388 U/L by week one and maintained the effect through the end of the study at week 26 (327 \u00b1 433 U/L) in patients with PNH. In the single arm clinical study (PNH Study 2), the effect was maintained through week 52 [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In patients with PNH, aHUS, and gMG, free C5 concentrations of <0.5 mcg/mL was correlated with complete blockade of terminal complement activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous maintenance doses of 900 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with PNH, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD serum eculizumab maximum concentration (C max ) was 194 \u00b1 76 mcg/mL and the trough concentration (C trough ) was 97 \u00b1 60 mcg/mL. Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1,200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with aHUS, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD C trough was 242 \u00b1 101 mcg/mL. Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1,200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with gMG, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD C max was 783 \u00b1 288 mcg/mL and the C trough was 341 \u00b1 172 mcg/mL. Steady state was achieved 4 weeks after starting eculizumab treatment, with accumulation ratio of approximately 2-fold in all studied indications. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that eculizumab pharmacokinetics were dose-linear and time-independent over the 600 mg to 1,200 mg dose range, with inter-individual variability of 21% to 38%. Distribution The eculizumab volume of distribution for a typical 70 kg patient was 5 L to 8 L. Elimination The half-life of eculizumab was approximately 270 hours to 414 hours. Plasma exchange or infusion increased the clearance of eculizumab by approximately 250-fold and reduced the half-life to 1.26 hours. Supplemental dosing is recommended when BKEMV is administered to patients receiving plasma exchange or infusion [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Specific Populations Age, Sex, and Race: The pharmacokinetics of eculizumab were not affected by age (2 months to 85 years), sex, or race. Renal Impairment: Renal function did not affect the pharmacokinetics of eculizumab in PNH (creatinine clearance of 8 mL/min to 396 mL/min calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula) or aHUS (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to105 mL/min/1.73 m 2 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula, or gMG patients (eGFR of 44 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to 168 mL/min/1.73 m 2 using MDRD formula). 12.6 IMMUNOGENICITY The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of eculizumab or of other eculizumab products. The immunogenicity of eculizumab has been evaluated using two different immunoassays for the detection of anti-eculizumab antibodies: a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the Fab fragment of eculizumab as target was used for the PNH indication; and an electro-chemiluminescence (ECL) bridging assay using the eculizumab whole molecule as target was used for the aHUS, and gMG indications, as well as for additional patients with PNH. In the PNH population, antibodies to eculizumab were detected in 3/196 (2%) patients using the ELISA assay and in 5/161 (3%) patients using the ECL assay during the entire treatment period. In the aHUS population, antibodies to eculizumab were detected in 3/100 (3%) patients using the ECL assay during the entire treatment period. None of the 62 patients with gMG had antibodies to eculizumab detected following the 26-week active treatment. An ECL based neutralizing assay with a low sensitivity of 2 mcg/mL was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies for the 5 patients with PNH and the 3 patients with aHUS, with anti-eculizumab antibody positive samples using the ECL assay. Two of 161 patients with PNH (1.2%) and 1 of 100 patients with aHUS (1%) had low positive values for neutralizing antibodies.

Monoexponential decay and plasma half-lives of about 0.5 hour are also seen following 2 hour or 7 hour infusions of 100 mg/m 2 . After the latter, the total-body clearances and volumes of distribution at steady-state for cisplatin are about 15 to 16 L/h/m 2 and 11 to 12 L/m 2 . Due to its unique chemical structure, the chlorine atoms of cisplatin are more subject to chemical displacement reactions by nucleophiles, such as water or sulfhydryl groups, than to enzyme-catalyzed metabolism. At physiological pH in the presence of 0.1M NaCl, the predominant molecular species are cisplatin and monohydroxymonochloro cis -diammine platinum (II) in nearly equal concentrations. The latter, combined with the possible direct displacement of the chlorine atoms by sulfhydryl groups of amino acids or proteins, accounts for the instability of cisplatin in biological matrices. The ratios of cisplatin to total free (ultrafilterable) platinum in the plasma vary considerably between patients and range from 0.5 to 1.1 after a dose of 100 mg/m 2 . Cisplatin does not undergo the instantaneous and reversible binding to plasma proteins that is characteristic of normal drug-protein binding. However, the platinum from cisplatin, but not cisplatin itself, becomes bound to several plasma proteins, including albumin, transferrin, and gamma globulin. Three hours after a bolus injection and two hours after the end of a three hour infusion, 90% of the plasma platinum is protein bound. The complexes between albumin and the platinum from cisplatin do not dissociate to a significant extent and are slowly eliminated with a minimum half-life of five days or more. Following cisplatin doses of 20 to 120 mg/m 2 , the concentrations of platinum are highest in liver, prostate, and kidney; somewhat lower in bladder, muscle, testicle, pancreas, and spleen; and lowest in bowel, adrenal, heart, lung, cerebrum, and cerebellum. Platinum is present in tissues for as long as 180 days after the last administration. With the exception of intracerebral tumors, platinum concentrations in tumors are generally somewhat lower than the concentrations in the organ where the tumor is located. Different metastatic sites in the same patient may have different platinum concentrations. Hepatic metastases have the highest platinum concentrations, but these are similar to the platinum concentrations in normal liver. Maximum red blood cell concentrations of platinum are reached within 90 to 150 minutes after a 100 mg/m 2 dose of cisplatin and decline in a biphasic manner with a terminal half-life of 36 to 47 days. Over a dose range of 40 to 140 mg cisplatin/m 2 given as a bolus injection or as infusions varying in length from 1 hour to 24 hours, from 10% to about 40% of the administered platinum is excreted in the urine in 24 hours. Over five days following administration of 40 to 100 mg/m 2 doses given as rapid, 2 hour to 3 hour, or 6 hour to 8 hour infusions, a mean of 35% to 51% of the dosed platinum is excreted in the urine. Similar mean urinary recoveries of platinum of about 14% to 30% of the dose are found following five daily administrations of 20, 30, or 40 mg/m 2 /day. Only a small percentage of the administered platinum is excreted beyond 24 hours post-infusion and most of the platinum excreted in the urine in 24 hours is excreted within the first few hours. Platinum-containing species excreted in the urine are the same as those found following the incubation of cisplatin with urine from healthy subjects, except that the proportions are different. The parent compound, cisplatin, is excreted in the urine and accounts for 13% to 17% of the dose excreted within one hour after administration of 50 mg/m 2 . The mean renal clearance of cisplatin exceeds creatinine clearance and is 62 and 50 mL/min/m 2 following administration of 100 mg/m 2 as 2 hour or 6 hour to 7 hour infusions, respectively. The renal clearance of free (ultrafilterable) platinum also exceeds the glomerular filtration rate indicating that cisplatin or other platinum-containing molecules are actively secreted by the kidneys. The renal clearance of free platinum is nonlinear and variable and is dependent on dose, urine flow rate, and individual variability in the extent of active secretion and possible tubular reabsorption. There is a potential for accumulation of ultrafilterable platinum plasma concentrations whenever cisplatin is administered on a daily basis but not when dosed on an intermittent basis. No significant relationships exist between the renal clearance of either free platinum or cisplatin and creatinine clearance. Although small amounts of platinum are present in the bile and large intestine after administration of cisplatin, the fecal excretion of platinum appears to be insignificant."], "manufacturer_name": ["Sagent Pharmaceuticals"], "substance_name": ["CISPLATIN"], "effective_time": "20240120", "product_ndc": ["25021-253"], "brand_name": ["Cisplatin"]}

IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts. IL-6 has been shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, initiation of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. IL-6 is also produced by synovial and endothelial cells leading to local production of IL-6 in joints affected by inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical studies in RA patients with the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg intravenous doses decreases in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) to within normal ranges were seen as early as week 2. Changes in pharmacodynamic parameters were observed (i.e., decreases in rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum amyloid A, fibrinogen and increases in hemoglobin) with doses, however the greatest improvements were observed with 8 mg per kg tocilizumab. Pharmacodynamic changes were also observed to occur after tocilizumab administration in GCA, PJIA, and SJIA patients (decreases in CRP, ESR, and increases in hemoglobin). The relationship between these pharmacodynamic findings and clinical efficacy is not known. In healthy subjects administered tocilizumab in doses from 2 to 28 mg per kg intravenously, absolute neutrophil counts decreased to the nadir 3 to 5 days following tocilizumab administration. Thereafter, neutrophils recovered towards baseline in a dose dependent manner. Rheumatoid arthritis and GCA patients demonstrated a similar pattern of absolute neutrophil counts following tocilizumab administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics PK of tocilizumab is characterized by nonlinear elimination which is a combination of linear clearance and Michaelis-Menten elimination. The nonlinear part of tocilizumab elimination leads to an increase in exposure that is more than dose-proportional. The pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab do not change with time. Due to the dependence of total clearance on tocilizumab serum concentrations, the half-life of tocilizumab is also concentration-dependent and varies depending on the serum concentration level. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in any patient population tested so far indicate no relationship between apparent clearance and the presence of anti-drug antibodies. Rheumatoid Arthritis - Intravenous Administration The pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and RA patients suggest that PK is similar between the two populations. The population PK model was developed from an analysis dataset composed of an IV dataset of 1793 patients from Study I, Study III, Study IV, and Study V. C mean is included in place of AUC tau , since for dosing regimens with different inter-dose intervals, the mean concentration over the dosing period characterizes the comparative exposure better than AUC tau . At high serum concentrations, when total clearance of tocilizumab is dominated by linear clearance, a terminal half-life of approximately 21.5 days was derived from the population parameter estimates. For doses of 4 mg/kg tocilizumab given every 4 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C max , C trough , and C mean of tocilizumab at steady state were 86.1 (44.8\u2013202) mcg/mL, 0.1 (0.0\u201314.6) mcg/mL, and 18.0 (8.9\u201350.7) mcg/mL, respectively. For doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab given every 4 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C max , C trough , and C mean of tocilizumab were 176 (75.4\u2013557) mcg/mL, 13.4 (0.1\u2013154) mcg/mL, and 54.0 (17\u2013260) mcg/mL, respectively. C max increased dose-proportionally between doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks, while a greater than dose-proportional increase was observed in C mean and C trough . At steady-state, C mean and C trough were 3.0 and 134 fold higher at 8 mg/kg as compared to 4 mg/kg, respectively. The accumulation ratios for AUC and C max after multiple doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W are low, while the accumulation ratios for C trough are higher (2.62 and 2.47, respectively). For C max , greater than 90% of the steady-state value was reached after the 1st IV infusion. For AUC tau and C mean , 90% of the steady-state value was reached after the 1st and 3rd infusion for 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg IV, while for C trough , approximately 90% of the steady-state value was reached after the 4th IV infusion after both doses. Population PK analysis identified body weight as a significant covariate impacting the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab. When given IV on a mg/kg basis, individuals with body weight \u2265 100 kg are predicted to have mean steady-state exposures higher than mean values for the patient population. Therefore, tocilizumab doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended in patients with RA [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Giant Cell Arteritis \u2013 Intravenous Administration The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab IV in GCA patients was characterized by a non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis which included 22 patients treated with 6 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. The median (range) C max , C trough and C mean of tocilizumab at steady state were 178 (115-320) mcg/mL, 22.7 (3.38-54.5) mcg/mL and 57.5 (32.9-110) mcg/mL, respectively. Steady state trough concentrations were within the range observed in GCA patients treated with tocilizumab by another route of administration. Based on pharmacokinetic exposure and extrapolation between RA and GCA patients, when given IV on a mg/kg basis, tocilizumab doses exceeding 600 mg per infusion are not recommended in patients with GCA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis \u2013 Intravenous Administration The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab (TCZ) in PJIA patients was characterized by a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included 188 patients who were treated with TCZ IV. For doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight at or above 30 kg) given every 4 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C max , C trough , and C mean of tocilizumab at steady state were 181 (114\u2013331) mcg/mL, 3.28 (0.02\u201335.4) mcg/mL, and 38.6 (22.2\u201383.8) mcg/mL, respectively. For doses of 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight less than 30 kg) given every 4 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C max , C trough , and C mean of tocilizumab were 167 (125\u2013220) mcg/mL, 0.35 (0\u201311.8) mcg/mL, and 30.8 (16.0\u201348.0) mcg/mL, respectively. The accumulation ratios were 1.05 and 1.16 for AUC 4weeks , and 1.43 and 2.22 for C trough for 10 mg/kg (BW less than 30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (BW at or above 30 kg) intravenous doses, respectively. No accumulation for C max was observed. Following 10 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg TCZ IV every 4 weeks doses in PJIA patients (aged 2 to 17 years), steady state concentrations (trough and average) were within the range of exposures in adult RA patients following 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, and steady state peak concentrations in PJIA patients were comparable to those following 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks in adult RA patients. Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis\u2014Intravenous Administration The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab (TCZ) in SJIA patients was characterized by a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included 89 patients who were treated with TCZ IV. For doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight at or above 30 kg) given every 2 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C max , C trough , and C mean of tocilizumab were 253 (120\u2013404) mcg/mL, 70.7 (5.26\u2013127) mcg/mL, and 117 (37.6\u2013199) mcg/mL, respectively. For doses of 12 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight less than 30 kg) given every 2 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C max , C trough , and C mean of tocilizumab were 274 (149\u2013444) mcg/mL, 65.9 (19.0\u2013135) mcg/mL, and 124 (60\u2013194) mcg/mL, respectively. The accumulation ratios were 1.95 and 2.01 for AUC4 weeks , and 3.41 and 3.20 for C trough for 12 mg/kg (BW less than 30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (BW at or above 30 kg) intravenous doses, respectively. Accumulation data for C max were 1.37 and 1.42 for 12 mg/kg (BW less than 30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (BW at or above 30 kg) intravenous doses, respectively. Following every other week dosing with tocilizumab IV, steady state was reached by 8 weeks for both body weight groups. Mean estimated tocilizumab exposure parameters were similar between the two dose groups defined by body weight. COVID-19 -Intravenous Administration The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients was characterized by a population pharmacokinetic analysis of a dataset composed of 380 adult patients treated with tocilizumab 8mg/kg intravenously (IV) in the COVACTA study [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] and another clinical study. For one dose of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab IV, the estimated median (range) C max and C day28 of tocilizumab were 151 (77.5-319) mcg/mL and 0.229 (0.00119-19.4) mcg/mL, respectively. For two doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab IV separated by at least 8 hours, the estimated median (range) Cmax and Cday28 of tocilizumab was 290 (152-604) mcg/mL and 7.04 (0.00474-54.8) mcg/mL, respectively. The weight-tiered dosing used in RECOVERY study, 800 mg for patients >90 kg, 600 mg for patients >65 and \u226490 kg, 400 mg for patients >40 and \u226465 kg, and 8mg/kg for patients \u226440 kg, is comparable to 8 mg/kg dosing and is expected to have similar exposure. Distribution Following intravenous dosing, tocilizumab undergoes biphasic elimination from the circulation. In rheumatoid arthritis patients the central volume of distribution was 3.5 L and the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.9 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 6.4 L. In GCA patients, the central volume of distribution was 4.09 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 3.37 L resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 7.46 L. In pediatric patients with PJIA, the central volume of distribution was 1.98 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.1 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 4.08 L. In pediatric patients with SJIA, the central volume of distribution was 1.87 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.14 L resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 4.01 L. In COVID-19 patients treated with one or two infusions of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously separated by 8 hours, the estimated central volume of distribution was 4.52 L, and the estimated peripheral volume of distribution was 4.23 L, resulting in a volume of distribution of 8.75 L. Elimination Tocilizumab is eliminated by a combination of linear clearance and nonlinear elimination. The concentration-dependent nonlinear elimination plays a major role at low tocilizumab concentrations. Once the nonlinear pathway is saturated, at higher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance is mainly determined by the linear clearance. The saturation of the nonlinear elimination leads to an increase in exposure that is more than dose-proportional. The pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab do not change with time. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in any patient population tested so far indicate no relationship between apparent clearance and the presence of anti-drug antibodies. The linear clearance in the population pharmacokinetic analysis was estimated to be 12.5 mL per h in RA patients, 6.7 mL per h in GCA patients, 5.8 mL per h in pediatric patients with PJIA, and 5.7 mL per h in pediatric patients with SJIA. In COVID-19 patients, serum concentrations were below the limit of quantification after 35 days on average following one infusion of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously. The average linear clearance in the population pharmacokinetic analysis was estimated to be 17.6 mL per hour in patients with baseline ordinal scale category 3 (OS 3, patients requiring supplemental oxygen), 22.5 mL per hour in patients with baseline OS 4 (patients requiring high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation), 29 mL per hour in patients with baseline OS 5 (patients requiring mechanical ventilation), and 35.4 mL per hour in patients with baseline OS 6 (patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or mechanical ventilation and additional organ support). Due to the dependence of total clearance on tocilizumab serum concentrations, the half-life of tocilizumab is also concentration-dependent and varies depending on the serum concentration level. For intravenous administration in RA patients, the concentration-dependent apparent t 1/2 is up to 11 days for 4 mg per kg and up to 13 days for 8 mg per kg every 4 weeks in patients with RA at steady-state. For intravenous administration in GCA patients, the TCZ concentration-dependent apparent t 1/2 was 13.2 days following 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks. The t 1/2 of tocilizumab in children with PJIA is up to 17 days for the two body weight categories (8 mg/kg for body weight at or above 30 kg or 10 mg/kg for body weight below 30 kg) during a dosing interval at steady state. The t 1/2 of tocilizumab intravenous in pediatric patients with SJIA is up to 16 days for the two body weight categories (8 mg/kg for body weight at or above 30 kg and 12 mg/kg for body weight below 30 kg every other week) during a dosing interval at steady-state. Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analyses in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients and GCA patients showed that age, gender and race did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab. Linear clearance was found to increase with body size. In RA patients, the body weight-based dose (8 mg per kg) resulted in approximately 86% higher exposure in patients who are greater than 100 kg in comparison to patients who are less than 60 kg. In COVID-19 patients, exposure following body-weight-based intravenous dosing (8 mg per kg tocilizumab up to 100 kg body weight with a maximum dose of 800 mg) was dependent on body weight and disease severity assessed by an ordinal scale (OS). Within an OS category, compared to patients with a mean body weight of 80 kg, exposure was 20% lower in patients weighing less than 60 kg. Exposure in patients weighing more than 100 kg was in the same range as exposure in patients with a mean body weight of 80 kg. For an 80 kg patient, exposure decreases as OS category increases; for each category increase, exposure decreases by 13%. Patients with Hepatic Impairment No formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab was conducted. Patients with Renal Impairment No formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab was conducted. Most of the RA and GCA patients in the population pharmacokinetic analysis had normal renal function or mild renal impairment. Mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance less than 80 mL per min and at or above 50 mL per min based on Cockcroft-Gault formula) did not impact the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro data suggested that IL-6 reduced mRNA expression for several CYP450 isoenzymes including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and this reduced expression was reversed by co-incubation with tocilizumab at clinically relevant concentrations. Accordingly, inhibition of IL-6 signaling in RA patients treated with tocilizumab may restore CYP450 activities to higher levels than those in the absence of tocilizumab leading to increased metabolism of drugs that are CYP450 substrates. Its effect on CYP2C8 or transporters (e.g., P-gp) is unknown. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation of TOFIDENCE , in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) should be performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product adjusted as needed. Caution should be exercised when TOFIDENCE is coadministered with drugs where decrease in effectiveness is undesirable, e.g., oral contraceptives (CYP3A4 substrates) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Simvastatin Simvastatin is a CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 substrate. In 12 RA patients not treated with tocilizumab, receiving 40 mg simvastatin, exposures of simvastatin and its metabolite, simvastatin acid, was 4- to 10-fold and 2-fold higher, respectively, than the exposures observed in healthy subjects. One week following administration of a single infusion of tocilizumab (10 mg per kg), exposure of simvastatin and simvastatin acid decreased by 57% and 39%, respectively, to exposures that were similar or slightly higher than those observed in healthy subjects. Exposures of simvastatin and simvastatin acid increased upon withdrawal of tocilizumab in RA patients. Selection of a particular dose of simvastatin in RA patients should take into account the potentially lower exposures that may result after initiation of TOFIDENCE, (due to normalization of CYP3A4) or higher exposures after discontinuation of TOFIDENCE. Omeprazole Omeprazole is a CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 substrate. In RA patients receiving 10 mg omeprazole, exposure to omeprazole was approximately 2 fold higher than that observed in healthy subjects. In RA patients receiving 10 mg omeprazole, before and one week after tocilizumab infusion (8 mg per kg), the omeprazole AUCinf decreased by 12% for poor (N=5) and intermediate metabolizers (N=5) and by 28% for extensive metabolizers (N=8) and were slightly higher than those observed in healthy subjects. Dextromethorphan Dextromethorphan is a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 substrate. In 13 RA patients receiving 30 mg dextromethorphan, exposure to dextromethorphan was comparable to that in healthy subjects. However, exposure to its metabolite, dextrorphan (a CYP3A4 substrate), was a fraction of that observed in healthy subjects. One week following administration of a single infusion of tocilizumab (8 mg per kg), dextromethorphan exposure was decreased by approximately 5%. However, a larger decrease (29%) in dextrorphan levels was noted after tocilizumab infusion."], "manufacturer_name": ["Biogen MA Inc."], "substance_name": ["TOCILIZUMAB"], "effective_time": "20250317", "product_ndc": ["64406-022", "64406-023", "64406-024"], "brand_name": ["Tofidence"]}

STRUCTURE"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine, but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] .

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin hydrochloride on malignant cells and its toxic effects on various organs are thought to be related to nucleotide base intercalation and cell membrane lipid binding activities of doxorubicin. Intercalation inhibits nucleotide replication and action of DNA and RNA polymerases. The interaction of doxorubicin with topoisomerase II to form DNA-cleavable complexes appears to be an important mechanism of doxorubicin hydrochloride cytocidal activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies conducted in patients with various types of tumors have shown that doxorubicin follows multiphasic disposition after intravenous injection. In four patients, doxorubicin demonstrated dose-independent pharmacokinetics across a dose range of 30 mg/m 2 to 70 mg/m 2 . Distribution The distribution half-life is approximately 5 minutes. Steady-state distribution volume ranges from 809 L/m 2 to 1214 L/m 2 . Binding of doxorubicin and its major metabolite, doxorubicinol, to plasma proteins is 75% and is independent of plasma concentration of doxorubicin up to 1.1 \u00b5g/mL. Doxorubicin does not cross the blood brain barrier. Elimination Plasma clearance is ranges from 324 mL/min/m 2 to 809 mL/min/m 2 . The terminal half-life is 20 hours to 48 hours. Metabolism Doxorubicin is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and P-gp. Enzymatic reduction at the 7 position and cleavage of the daunosamine sugar yields aglycones which are accompanied by free radical formation, the local production of which may contribute to the cardiotoxic activity of doxorubicin hydrochloride. Disposition of doxorubicinol in patients is formation rate limited, with the terminal half-life of doxorubicinol being similar to doxorubicin. The relative exposure of doxorubicinol, i.e., the ratio between the AUC of doxorubicinol and the AUC of doxorubicin is approximately 0.5. Excretion Plasma clearance is predominately by metabolism and biliary excretion. Approximately 40% of the dose appears in the bile in 5 days, while only 5% to 12% of the drug and its metabolites appear in the urine during the same time period. In urine, <3% of the dose was recovered as doxorubicinol over 7 days. Specific Populations Weight Systemic clearance of doxorubicin is significantly reduced in obese women with ideal body weight greater than 130%. There was a significant reduction in clearance without any change in volume of distribution in obese patients when compared with normal patients with less than 115% ideal body weight. Pediatric Patients Following administration of doses ranging from 10 mg/m 2 to 75 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin hydrochloride to 60 patients ranging from 2 months to 20 years, doxorubicin clearance averaged 1443 \u00b1 114 mL/min/m 2 . Further analysis demonstrated that clearance in 52 patients ranging from 2 to 20 years (1540 mL/min/m 2 ) was increased compared with adults. However, clearance in infants younger than 2 years of age (813 mL/min/m 2 ) was decreased compared with older patients (ranging from 2 to 20 years) and approached the range of clearance values determined in adults [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Sex A published clinical study involving 6 men and 21 women with no prior anthracycline therapy reported a significantly higher median doxorubicin clearance in men compared to women (1088 mL/min/m 2 versus 433 mL/min/m 2 ). However, the terminal half-life of doxorubicin was longer in men compared to women (54 versus 35 hours).

The pH of the solution in the 5 mL vial is 4.5 to 5.5. Figure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron HCl in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42 \u00b1 34%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110 \u00b1 45%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067\u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4 . The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Coadministration of 0.25 mg palonosetron hydrochloride injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."], "manufacturer_name": ["Avenacy, Inc."], "substance_name": ["PALONOSETRON HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240515", "product_ndc": ["83634-777"], "brand_name": ["Palonosetron Hydrochloride"]}

Gadobutrol has a molecular formula of C 18 H 31 GdN 4 O 9 and a molecular weight of 604.72. Gadobutrol injection is a sterile, clear, colorless to pale yellow solution containing 604.72 mg (1.0 mmol) of gadobutrol per mL as the active ingredient with 0.513 mg of calcobutrol sodium, 1.211 mg of trometamol, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) and water for injection.

The extent of decrease of T 1 and T 2 relaxation times, and therefore the amount of signal enhancement obtained from gadobutrol, is based upon several factors including the concentration of gadobutrol in the tissue, the field strength of the MRI system, and the relative ratio of the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times. At the recommended dose, the T 1 shortening effect is observed with greatest sensitivity in T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance sequences. In T 2 *-weighted sequences the induction of local magnetic field inhomogeneities by the large magnetic moment of gadolinium and at high concentrations (during bolus injection) leads to a signal decrease. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Gadobutrol leads to distinct shortening of the relaxation times even in low concentrations. At pH 7, 37\u00b0C and 1.5 T, the relaxivity (r 1 ) - determined from the influence on the relaxation times (T 1 ) of protons in plasma - is 5.2 L/(mmol\u00b7sec) and the relaxivity (r 2 ) - determined from the influence on the relaxation times (T 2 ) - is 6.1 L/(mmol\u00b7sec). These relaxivities display only slight dependence on the strength of the magnetic field. The T 1 shortening effect of paramagnetic contrast agents is dependent on concentration and r 1 relaxivity (see Table 3). This may improve tissue visualization.

At the site of imaging, the relative height and width of the time intensity curve for gadobutrol injection varies as a function of imaging location and multiple patient, injection, and device-specific factors. Gadobutrol is a water-soluble, hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient between n-butanol and buffer at pH 7.6 of about 0.006. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution After intravenous administration, gadobutrol is rapidly distributed in the extracellular space. After a gadobutrol dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight, an average level of 0.59 mmol gadobutrol/L was measured in plasma 2 minutes after the injection and 0.3 mmol gadobutrol/L 60 minutes after the injection. Gadobutrol does not display any particular protein binding. Following GBCA administration, gadolinium is present for months or years in brain, bone, skin, and other organs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Metabolism Gadobutrol is not metabolized. Elimination Values for AUC, body weight normalized plasma clearance and half-life are given in Table 4, below. Gadobutrol is excreted in an unchanged form via the kidneys. In healthy subjects, renal clearance of gadobutrol is 1.1 to 1.7 mL/(min\u2219kg) and thus comparable to the renal clearance of inulin, confirming that gadobutrol is eliminated by glomerular filtration. Within two hours after intravenous administration more than 50% and within 12 hours more than 90% of the given dose is eliminated via the urine. Extra-renal elimination is negligible. Specific Populations Gender Gender has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of gadobutrol. Geriatric A single intravenous dose of 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol injection was administered to 15 elderly and 16 non-elderly subjects. AUC was slightly higher and clearance slightly lower in elderly subjects as compared to non-elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of gadobutrol were evaluated in two studies in a total of 130 patients age 2 to less than 18 years and in 43 patients less than 2 years of age (including term neonates). Patients received a single intravenous dose of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadobutrol injection. The pharmacokinetic profile of gadobutrol in pediatric patients is similar to that in adults, resulting in similar values for AUC, body weight normalized plasma clearance, as well as elimination half-life. Approximately 99% (median value) of the dose was recovered in urine within 6 hours (this information was derived from the 2 to less than 18 year old age group).

After intravenous injection of 0.1 mmol gadobutrol/kg body weight, the elimination half-life was 5.8 \u00b1 2.4 hours in mild to moderately impaired patients (80 > CL CR > 30 mL/min) and 17.6 \u00b1 6.2 hours in severely impaired patients not on dialysis (CL CR < 30 mL/min). The mean AUC of gadobutrol in patients with normal renal function was 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 mmol\u2219h/L, compared to 4 \u00b1 1.8 mmol\u2219h/L in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and 11.5 \u00b1 4.3 mmol\u2219h/L in patients with severe renal impairment. Complete recovery in the urine was seen in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment within 72 hours. In patients with severely impaired renal function about 80% of the administered dose was recovered in the urine within 5 days. For patients receiving hemodialysis, physicians may consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of gadobutrol injection in order to enhance the contrast agent\u2019s elimination. Sixty-eight percent (68%) of gadobutrol is removed from the body after the first dialysis, 94% after the second dialysis, and 98% after the third dialysis session.

STRUCTURE"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine, but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides.

In subjects with normal kidney function, multiple intravenous dosing of 1 g of vancomycin (15 mg/kg) infused over 60 minutes produces mean plasma concentrations of approximately 63 mcg/mL immediately after the completion of infusion, mean plasma concentrations of approximately 23 mcg/mL 2 hours after infusion, and mean plasma concentrations of approximately 8 mcg/mL 11 hours after the end of the infusion. Multiple dosing of 500 mg infused over 30 minutes produces mean plasma concentrations of about 49 mcg/mL at the completion of infusion, mean plasma concentrations of about 19 mcg/mL 2 hours after infusion, and mean plasma concentrations of about 10 mcg/mL 6 hours after infusion. The plasma concentrations during multiple dosing are similar to those after a single dose. The mean elimination half-life of vancomycin from plasma is 4 to 6 hours in subjects with normal renal function. In the first 24 hours, about 75% of an administered dose of vancomycin is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration. Mean plasma clearance is about 0.058 L/kg/h, and mean renal clearance is about 0.048 L/kg/h. Renal dysfunction slows excretion of vancomycin.

However, the safety and efficacy of the intraperitoneal use of vancomycin has not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials (see PRECAUTIONS ). Total systemic and renal clearance of vancomycin may be reduced in the elderly. Vancomycin is approximately 55% serum protein bound as measured by ultrafiltration at vancomycin serum concentrations of 10 to 100 mcg/mL. After IV administration of vancomycin, inhibitory concentrations are present in pleural, pericardial, ascitic, and synovial fluids; in urine; in peritoneal dialysis fluid; and in atrial appendage tissue. Vancomycin does not readily diffuse across normal meninges into the spinal fluid; but, when the meninges are inflamed, penetration into the spinal fluid occurs.

Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose.

The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."], "manufacturer_name": ["Pilnova Pharma Inc"], "substance_name": ["AZACITIDINE"], "effective_time": "20241216", "product_ndc": ["83774-102"], "brand_name": ["AZACITIDINE"]}

Zoledronic acid is designated chemically as (1-Hydroxy-2-imidazol-1-yl-phosphonoethyl) phosphonic acid monohydrate and its structural formula is: Zoledronic acid is a white crystalline powder. Its molecular formula is C 5 H 10 N 2 O 7 P 2 \u2022H 2 O and its molar mass is 290.1g/mol. Zoledronic acid is highly soluble in 0.1N sodium hydroxide solution, sparingly soluble in water and 0.1N hydrochloric acid, and practically insoluble in organic solvents. The pH of a 0.7% solution of zoledronic acid in water is approximately 2.0.

Inactive Ingredients: mannitol, USP, as bulking agent, water for injection, and sodium citrate, USP, as buffering agent. structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The principal pharmacologic action of zoledronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption. Although the antiresorptive mechanism is not completely understood, several factors are thought to contribute to this action. In vitro , zoledronic acid inhibits osteoclastic activity and induces osteoclast apoptosis. Zoledronic acid also blocks the osteoclastic resorption of mineralized bone and cartilage through its binding to bone. Zoledronic acid inhibits the increased osteoclastic activity and skeletal calcium release induced by various stimulatory factors released by tumors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical studies in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) showed that single-dose infusions of zoledronic acid injection are associated with decreases in serum calcium and phosphorus and increases in urinary calcium and phosphorus excretion. Osteoclastic hyperactivity resulting in excessive bone resorption is the underlying pathophysiologic derangement in hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM, tumor-induced hypercalcemia) and metastatic bone disease. Excessive release of calcium into the blood as bone is resorbed results in polyuria and gastrointestinal disturbances, with progressive dehydration and decreasing glomerular filtration rate. This, in turn, results in increased renal resorption of calcium, setting up a cycle of worsening systemic hypercalcemia. Reducing excessive bone resorption and maintaining adequate fluid administration are, therefore, essential to the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy. Patients who have hypercalcemia of malignancy can generally be divided into two groups according to the pathophysiologic mechanism involved: humoral hypercalcemia and hypercalcemia due to tumor invasion of bone. In humoral hypercalcemia, osteoclasts are activated and bone resorption is stimulated by factors such as parathyroid hormone-related protein, which are elaborated by the tumor and circulate systemically. Humoral hypercalcemia usually occurs in squamous cell malignancies of the lung or head and neck or in genitourinary tumors such as renal cell carcinoma or ovarian cancer. Skeletal metastases may be absent or minimal in these patients. Extensive invasion of bone by tumor cells can also result in hypercalcemia due to local tumor products that stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. Tumors commonly associated with locally mediated hypercalcemia include breast cancer and multiple myeloma. Total serum calcium levels in patients who have hypercalcemia of malignancy may not reflect the severity of hypercalcemia, since concomitant hypoalbuminemia is commonly present. Ideally, ionized calcium levels should be used to diagnose and follow hypercalcemic conditions; however, these are not commonly or rapidly available in many clinical situations. Therefore, adjustment of the total serum calcium value for differences in albumin levels (corrected serum calcium, CSC) is often used in place of measurement of ionized calcium; several nomograms are in use for this type of calculation [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic data in patients with hypercalcemia are not available. Distribution Single or multiple (every 28 days) 5-minute or 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8, or 16 mg zoledronic acid injection were given to 64 patients with cancer and bone metastases. The post-infusion decline of zoledronic acid concentrations in plasma was consistent with a triphasic process showing a rapid decrease from peak concentrations at end of infusion to less than 1% of C max 24 hours postinfusion with population half-lives of t 1/2\u03b1 0.24 hours and t 1/2\u03b2 1.87 hours for the early disposition phases of the drug. The terminal elimination phase of zoledronic acid was prolonged, with very low concentrations in plasma between Days 2 and 28 postinfusion, and a terminal elimination half-life t 1/2\u03b3 of 146 hours. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC 0-24h ) of zoledronic acid was dose proportional from 2 to 16 mg. The accumulation of zoledronic acid measured over three cycles was low, with mean AUC 0-24h ratios for cycles 2 and 3 versus 1 of 1.13 \u00b1 0.30 and 1.16 \u00b1 0.36, respectively. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed low affinity of zoledronic acid for the cellular components of human blood, with a mean blood to plasma concentration ratio of 0.59 in a concentration range of 30 ng/mL to 5,000 ng/mL. In vitro , the plasma protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% at 2 ng/mL to 77% at 2,000 ng/mL of zoledronic acid. Metabolism Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro . Zoledronic acid does not undergo biotransformation in vivo . In animal studies, less than 3% of the administered intravenous dose was found in the feces, with the balance either recovered in the urine or taken up by bone, indicating that the drug is eliminated intact via the kidney. Following an intravenous dose of 20 nCi 14 C-zoledronic acid in a patient with cancer and bone metastases, only a single radioactive species with chromatographic properties identical to those of parent drug was recovered in urine, which suggests that zoledronic acid is not metabolized. Excretion In 64 patients with cancer and bone metastases, on average (\u00b1 SD) 39 \u00b1 16% of the administered zoledronic acid dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours, with only trace amounts of drug found in urine post-Day 2. The cumulative percent of drug excreted in the urine over 0 to 24 hours was independent of dose. The balance of drug not recovered in urine over 0 to 24 hours, representing drug presumably bound to bone, is slowly released back into the systemic circulation, giving rise to the observed prolonged low plasma concentrations. The 0 to 24 hour renal clearance of zoledronic acid was 3.7 \u00b1 2.0 L/h. Zoledronic acid clearance was independent of dose but dependent upon the patient's creatinine clearance. In a study in patients with cancer and bone metastases, increasing the infusion time of a 4-mg dose of zoledronic acid from 5 minutes (n=5) to 15 minutes (n=7) resulted in a 34% decrease in the zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion ([mean \u00b1 SD] 403 \u00b1 118 ng/mL versus 264 \u00b1 86 ng/mL) and a 10% increase in the total AUC (378 \u00b1 116 ng x h/mL versus 420 \u00b1 218 ng x h/mL). The difference between the AUC means was not statistically significant. Special Populations Pediatrics Zoledronic acid injection is not indicated for use in children [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Geriatrics The pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid were not affected by age in patients with cancer and bone metastases who ranged in age from 38 years to 84 years. Race Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not indicate any differences in pharmacokinetics among Japanese and North American (Caucasian and African American) patients with cancer and bone metastases. Hepatic Insufficiency No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. Renal Insufficiency The pharmacokinetic studies conducted in 64 cancer patients represented typical clinical populations with normal to moderately impaired renal function. Compared to patients with normal renal function (N=37), patients with mild renal impairment (N=15) showed an average increase in plasma AUC of 15%, whereas patients with moderate renal impairment (N=11) showed an average increase in plasma AUC of 43%. Limited pharmacokinetic data are available for zoledronic acid injection in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). Based on population PK/PD modeling, the risk of renal deterioration appears to increase with AUC, which is doubled at a creatinine clearance of 10 mL/min. Creatinine clearance is calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula: Zoledronic acid injection systemic clearance in individual patients can be calculated from the population clearance of zoledronic acid injection, CL (L/h)=6.5(CrCl/90) 0.4 . These formulae can be used to predict the zoledronic acid injection AUC in patients, where CL = Dose/AUC 0-\u221e . The average AUC 0-24 in patients with normal renal function was 0.42 mg\u2022h/L and the calculated AUC 0-\u221e for a patient with creatinine clearance of 75 mL/min was 0.66 mg\u2022h/L following a 4-mg dose of zoledronic acid injection. However, efficacy and safety of adjusted dosing based on these formulae have not been prospectively assessed [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. image description"], "manufacturer_name": ["Heritage Pharmaceuticals Inc. d/b/a Avet Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "substance_name": ["ZOLEDRONIC ACID"], "effective_time": "20230918", "product_ndc": ["23155-170"], "brand_name": ["Zoledronic acid"]}

Eptifibatide Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Eptifibatide reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive ligands to GP IIb/IIIa. When administered intravenously, eptifibatide inhibits ex vivo platelet aggregation in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. Platelet aggregation inhibition is reversible following cessation of the eptifibatide infusion; this is thought to result from dissociation of eptifibatide from the platelet. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Infusion of eptifibatide into baboons caused a dose-dependent inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation, with complete inhibition of aggregation achieved at infusion rates greater than 5 mcg/kg/min. In a baboon model that is refractory to aspirin and heparin, doses of eptifibatide that inhibit aggregation prevented acute thrombosis with only a modest prolongation (2- to 3-fold) of the bleeding time. Platelet aggregation in dogs was also inhibited by infusions of eptifibatide, with complete inhibition at 2 mcg/kg/min. This infusion dose completely inhibited canine coronary thrombosis induced by coronary artery injury (Folts model). Human pharmacodynamic data were obtained in healthy subjects and in patients presenting with UA or NSTEMI and/or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Studies in healthy subjects enrolled only males; patient studies enrolled approximately one-third women. In these studies, eptifibatide inhibited ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and other agonists in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. The effect of eptifibatide was observed immediately after administration of a 180 mcg/kg intravenous bolus. Table 4 shows the effects of dosing regimens of eptifibatide used in the IMPACT II and PURSUIT studies on ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by 20 \u00b5M ADP in PPACK-anticoagulated platelet-rich plasma and on bleeding time. The effects of the dosing regimen used in ESPRIT on platelet aggregation have not been studied.

When administered alone, eptifibatide has no measurable effect on PT or aPTT. There were no important differences between men and women or between age groups in the pharmacodynamic properties of eptifibatide. Differences among ethnic groups have not been assessed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide are linear and dose-proportional for bolus doses ranging from 90 to 250 mcg/kg and infusion rates from 0.5 to 3 mcg/kg/min. Plasma elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours. Administration of a single 180 mcg/kg bolus combined with an infusion produces an early peak level, followed by a small decline prior to attaining steady state (within 4 to 6 hours). This decline can be prevented by administering a second 180 mcg/kg bolus 10 minutes after the first. The extent of eptifibatide binding to human plasma protein is about 25%. Clearance in patients with coronary artery disease is about 55 mL/kg/h. In healthy subjects, renal clearance accounts for approximately 50% of total body clearance, with the majority of the drug excreted in the urine as eptifibatide, deaminated eptifibatide, and other, more polar metabolites. No major metabolites have been detected in human plasma. Special Populations Geriatric Patients in clinical studies were older (range: 20 to 94 years) than those in the clinical pharmacology studies. Elderly patients with coronary artery disease demonstrated higher plasma levels and lower total body clearance of eptifibatide when given the same dose as younger patients. Limited data are available on lighter weight (<50 kg) patients over 75 years of age. Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (CrCl <50 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation), the clearance of eptifibatide is reduced by approximately 50% and steady-state plasma levels approximately doubled [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration (2) ] .

Upon binding to FR\u03b1, mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is internalized followed by intracellular release of DM4 via proteolytic cleavage. DM4 disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationships Higher exposure to mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx was associated with higher overall response rates and longer median PFS and OS; higher exposure to mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx was also associated with higher incidence of ocular adverse reactions as well as marginally increased peripheral neuropathy.

Unconjugated DM4 and S-methyl-DM4 undergo metabolism by CYP3A4. In human plasma, DM4 and S-methyl DM4 were identified as the main circulating metabolites, accounting for approximately 0.4% and 1.4% of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx AUC, respectively. Excretion S-methyl DM4 and DM4-sulfo-SPDB-lysine were detected in urine within 24 hours of infusion as the main metabolites. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx were observed based on age (32 to 89 years), race (White, Black, or Asian), body weight (36 to 136 kg), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin \u2264ULN and any AST >ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST), or mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 89 mL/min).

Docetaxel (anhydrous) has the following structural formula: Docetaxel is a white to almost-white powder with an empirical formula of C 43 H 53 NO 14 , and a molecular weight of 807.88. It is highly lipophilic and practically insoluble in water. Docetaxel Injection, USP is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, clear, colorless to pale yellow solution at 10 mg/mL concentration.

Docetaxel Injection requires NO prior dilution with a diluent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells that is essential for mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel binds to free tubulin and promotes the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly. This leads to the production of microtubule bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of microtubules, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells. Docetaxel's binding to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments in the bound microtubules, a feature which differs from most spindle poisons currently in clinical use. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel has been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20 mg/m 2 to 115 mg/m 2 in phase 1 studies. The area under the curve (AUC) was dose proportional following doses of 70 mg/m 2 to 115 mg/m 2 with infusion times of 1 to 2 hours. Docetaxel\u2019s pharmacokinetic profile is consistent with a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model, with initial rapid distribution phase and the late (terminal) phase. Distribution Mean steady state volume of distribution was 113 L. Docetaxel is approximately 94% protein bound in vitro , mainly to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, albumin, and lipoproteins. In three cancer patients, the in vitro binding to plasma proteins was approximately 97%. Dexamethasone does not affect the protein binding of docetaxel. Elimination With extended plasma sampling up to 8 to 22 days post infusion, the estimated mean total body clearance was 18 L/h/m 2 (range of means: 14 to 23) and mean terminal elimination half-life was 116 hours (range of means: 92 to 135). Metabolism Docetaxel is metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme in vitro [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Excretion In three cancer patients urinary and fecal excretion accounted for approximately 6% and 75% of the administered radioactivity, respectively, within 7 days. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in feces was excreted during the first 48 hours as 1 major and 3 minor metabolites with less than 8% as unchanged drug. Specific Populations Effect of Age A population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out after docetaxel treatment of 535 patients dosed at 100 mg/m 2 . Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by this analysis were very close to those estimated from phase 1 studies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was not influenced by age. Effect of Gender The population pharmacokinetics analysis described above also indicated that gender did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Hepatic Impairment The population pharmacokinetic analysis described above indicated that in patients with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver impairment (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN), total body clearance was lowered by an average of 27%, resulting in a 38% increase in systemic exposure (AUC). This average, however, includes a substantial range and there is, at present, no measurement that would allow recommendation for dose adjustment in such patients. Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminase and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Effect of Race Mean total body clearance for Japanese patients dosed at the range of 10 mg/m 2 to 90 mg/m 2 was similar to that of European/American populations dosed at 100 mg/m 2 , suggesting no significant difference in the elimination of docetaxel in the two populations. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Ketoconazole The effect of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was investigated in 7 cancer patients. Patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel (100 mg/m 2 intravenous) alone or docetaxel (10 mg/m 2 intravenous) in combination with ketoconazole (200 mg orally once daily for 3 days) in a crossover design with a 3-week washout period. The results of this study indicated that the mean dose-normalized AUC of docetaxel was increased 2.2-fold and its clearance was reduced by 49% when docetaxel was coadministered with ketoconazole [ see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Drug Interactions (7) ]. Effect of Combination Therapies \u2022 Dexamethasone: Docetaxel total body clearance was not modified by pretreatment with dexamethasone. \u2022 Cisplatin: Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that previously observed following monotherapy with docetaxel. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin in combination therapy with docetaxel was similar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \u2022 Cisplatin and Fluorouracil: The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid tumors had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual drug. \u2022 Prednisone: A population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma data from 40 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer indicated that docetaxel systemic clearance in combination with prednisone is similar to that observed following administration of docetaxel alone. \u2022 Cyclophosphamide and Doxorubicin: A study was conducted in 30 patients with advanced breast cancer to determine the potential for drug-drug interactions between docetaxel (75 mg/m 2 ), doxorubicin (50 mg/m 2 ), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m 2 ) when administered in combination. The coadministration of docetaxel had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide when the three drugs were given in combination compared to coadministration of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide only. In addition, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide had no effect on docetaxel plasma clearance when the three drugs were given in combination compared to historical data for docetaxel monotherapy."], "manufacturer_name": ["Hospira, Inc."], "substance_name": ["DOCETAXEL ANHYDROUS"], "effective_time": "20250120", "product_ndc": ["0409-0016", "0409-2026"], "brand_name": ["Docetaxel"]}

Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3 . Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline.

Lacosamide injection, USP has a pH of 3.8 to 5.0."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be fully elucidated. In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data from the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. Lacosamide exposure is correlated with the reduction in seizure frequency. However, doses above 400 mg/day do not appear to confer additional benefit in group analyses. Cardiac Electrophysiology Electrocardiographic effects of lacosamide were determined in a double-blind, randomized clinical pharmacology trial of 247 healthy subjects. Chronic oral doses of 400 and 800 mg/day were compared with placebo and a positive control (400 mg moxifloxacin). Lacosamide did not prolong QTc interval and did not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. Lacosamide produced a small, dose-related increase in mean PR interval. At steady-state, the time of the maximum observed mean PR interval corresponded with t max . The placebo-subtracted maximum increase in PR interval (at t max ) was 7.3 ms for the 400 mg/day group and 11.9 ms for the 800 mg/day group. For patients who participated in the controlled trials, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum increase in PR interval for a 400 mg/day lacosamide dose was 3.1 ms in patients with partial-onset seizures and 9.4 ms for patients with diabetic neuropathy. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide have been studied in healthy adult subjects (age range 18 to 87), adults with partial-onset seizures, adults with diabetic neuropathy, and subjects with renal and hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide are similar in healthy subjects, patients with partial-onset seizures, and patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass effect with a high absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. The maximum lacosamide plasma concentrations occur approximately 1 to 4 hour post-dose after oral dosing, and elimination half-life is approximately 13 hours. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice daily repeated administration. Pharmacokinetics of lacosamide are dose proportional (100 to 800 mg) and time invariant, with low inter- and intra-subject variability. Compared to lacosamide the major metabolite, O-desmethyl metabolite, has a longer T max (0.5 to 12 hours) and elimination half-life (15 to 23 hours). Absorption and Bioavailability Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration. The oral bioavailability of lacosamide tablets is approximately 100%. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption. After intravenous administration, C max is reached at the end of infusion. The 30- and 60-minute intravenous infusions are bioequivalent to the oral tablet. For the 15-minute intravenous infusion, bioequivalence was met for AUC (0-tz) but not for C max . The point estimate of C max was 20% higher than C max for oral tablet and the 90% CI for C max exceeded the upper boundary of the bioequivalence range. In a trial comparing the oral tablet with an oral solution containing 10 mg/mL lacosamide, bioequivalence between both formulations was shown. A single loading dose of 200 mg approximates steady-state concentrations comparable to the 100 mg twice daily oral administration. Distribution The volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/kg and thus close to the volume of total body water. Lacosamide is less than 15% bound to plasma proteins. Metabolism and Elimination Lacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation. After intravenous administration of 100 mg [14C]-lacosamide approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces. The major compounds excreted were unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose), its O-desmethyl metabolite (approximately 30%), and a structurally unknown polar fraction (~20%). The plasma exposure of the major human metabolite, O-desmethyl-lacosamide, is approximately 10% of that of lacosamide. This metabolite has no known pharmacological activity. The CYP isoforms mainly responsible for the formation of the major metabolite (O-desmethyl) are CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours and is not altered by different doses, multiple dosing or intravenous administration. There is no enantiomeric interconversion of lacosamide. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Lacosamide and its major metabolite are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion. The AUC of lacosamide was increased approximately 25% in mildly (CL CR 50 to 80 mL/min) and moderately (CL CR 30 to 50 mL/min) and 60% in severely (CL CR \u226430 mL/min) renally impaired patients compared to subjects with normal renal function (CL CR >80 mL/min), whereas C max was unaffected. Lacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis. Following a 4-hour hemodialysis treatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50% [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Hepatic Impairment Lacosamide undergoes metabolism. Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of lacosamide (approximately 50 to 60% higher AUC compared to healthy subjects). The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide have not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] .

Geriatric Patients In the elderly (>65 years), dose and body-weight normalized AUC and C max is about 20% increased compared to young subjects (18 to 64 years). This may be related to body weight and decreased renal function in elderly subjects. Gender Lacosamide clinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically relevant influence on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide. Race There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide between Asian, Black, and Caucasian subjects. CYP2C19 Polymorphism There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide between CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers. Results from a trial in poor metabolizers (PM) (N=4) and extensive metabolizers (EM) (N=8) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 showed that lacosamide plasma concentrations were similar in PMs and EMs, but plasma concentrations and the amount excreted into urine of the O-desmethyl metabolite were about 70% reduced in PMs compared to EMs. Drug Interactions In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In vitro metabolism studies indicate that lacosamide does not induce the enzyme activity of drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4. Lacosamide did not inhibit CYP 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5 at plasma concentrations observed in clinical studies. In vitro data suggest that lacosamide has the potential to inhibit CYP2C19 at therapeutic concentrations. However, an in vivo study with omeprazole did not show an inhibitory effect on omeprazole pharmacokinetics. Lacosamide was not a substrate or inhibitor for P-glycoprotein. Lacosamide is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have increased exposure to lacosamide. Since <15% of lacosamide is bound to plasma proteins, a clinically relevant interaction with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites is unlikely. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with AEDs Effect of lacosamide on concomitant AEDs Lacosamide 400 mg/day had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of 600 mg/day valproic acid and 400 mg/day carbamazepine in healthy subjects. The placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients with partial-onset seizures showed that steady-state plasma concentrations of levetiracetam, carbamazepine, carbamazepine epoxide, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine monohydroxy derivative (MHD), phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, gabapentin, clonazepam, and zonisamide were not affected by concomitant intake of lacosamide at any dose. Effect of concomitant AEDs on lacosamide Drug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects showed that 600 mg/day valproic acid had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of 400 mg/day lacosamide. Likewise, 400 mg/day carbamazepine had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide in a healthy subject study. Population pharmacokinetics results in patients with partial-onset seizures showed small reductions (15% to 20% lower) in lacosamide plasma concentrations when lacosamide was coadministered with carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin. Drug-drug interaction studies with other drugs Digoxin There was no effect of lacosamide (400 mg/day) on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.5 mg once daily) in a study in healthy subjects. Metformin There were no clinically relevant changes in metformin levels following coadministration of lacosamide (400 mg/day). Metformin (500 mg three times a day) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide (400 mg/day). Omeprazole Omeprazole is a CYP2C19 substrate and inhibitor. There was no effect of lacosamide (600 mg/day) on the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole (40 mg single dose) in healthy subjects. The data indicated that lacosamide had little in vivo inhibitory or inducing effect on CYP2C19. Omeprazole at a dose of 40 mg once daily had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide (300 mg single dose). However, plasma levels of the O-desmethyl metabolite were reduced about 60% in the presence of omeprazole. Midazolam Midazolam is a 3A4 substrate. There was no effect of lacosamide (200 mg single dose or repeat doses of 400 mg/day given as 200 mg BID) on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (single dose, 7.5 mg), indicating no inhibitory or inducing effects on CYP3A4. Oral Contraceptives There was no influence of lacosamide (400 mg/day) on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel in healthy subjects, except that a 20% increase in ethinylestradiol C max was observed.

The mechanism of action of ketorolac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. The biological activity of ketorolac tromethamine is associated with the S-form. Ketorolac tromethamine possesses no sedative or anxiolytic properties. The peak analgesic effect of ketorolac tromethamine occurs within 2 to 3 hours and is not statistically significantly different over the recommended dosage range of ketorolac tromethamine. The greatest difference between large and small doses of ketorolac tromethamine by either route is in the duration of analgesia. Pharmacokinetics Ketorolac tromethamine is a racemic mixture of [-]S- and [+]R-enantiomeric forms, with the S-form having analgesic activity. Comparison of IV, IM and Oral Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of ketorolac tromethamine, following IV, IM and oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine are compared in Table 1 . In adults, the extent of bioavailability following administration of the ORAL and IM forms of ketorolac tromethamine was equal to that following an IV bolus.

This implies that the pharmacokinetics of ketorolac tromethamine in adults, following single or multiple IM, IV or recommended oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine, are linear. At the higher recommended doses, there is a proportional increase in the concentrations of free and bound racemate. Distribution The mean apparent volume (V \u03b2 ) of ketorolac tromethamine following complete distribution was approximately 13 liters. This parameter was determined from single-dose data. The ketorolac tromethamine racemate has been shown to be highly protein bound (99%). Nevertheless, plasma concentrations as high as 10 mcg/mL will only occupy approximately 5% of the albumin binding sites. Thus, the unbound fraction for each enantiomer will be constant over the therapeutic range. A decrease in serum albumin, however, will result in increased free drug concentrations. Ketorolac tromethamine is excreted in human milk (see PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers ). Metabolism Ketorolac tromethamine is largely metabolized in the liver. The metabolic products are hydroxylated and conjugated forms of the parent drug. The products of metabolism, and some unchanged drug, are excreted in the urine. Excretion The principal route of elimination of ketorolac and its metabolites is renal. About 92% of a given dose is found in the urine, approximately 40% as metabolites and 60% as unchanged ketorolac. Approximately 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces. A single-dose study with 10 mg ketorolac tromethamine (n=9) demonstrated that the S-enantiomer is cleared approximately two times faster than the R-enantiomer and that the clearance was independent of the route of administration. This means that the ratio of S/R plasma concentrations decreases with time after each dose. There is little or no inversion of the R- to S- form in humans. The clearance of the racemate in normal subjects, elderly individuals and in hepatically and renally impaired patients is outlined in Table 2 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Kinetics in Special Populations ). The half-life of the ketorolac tromethamine S-enantiomer was approximately 2.5 hours (SD\u00b10.4) compared with 5 hours (SD\u00b11.7) for the R-enantiomer. In other studies, the half-life for the racemate has been reported to lie within the range of 5 to 6 hours. Accumulation Ketorolac tromethamine administered as an IV bolus, every 6 hours, for 5 days, to healthy subjects (n=13), showed no significant difference in C max on Day 1 and Day 5. Trough levels averaged 0.29 mcg/mL (SD\u00b10.13) on Day 1 and 0.55 mcg/mL (SD\u00b10.23) on Day 6. Steady state was approached after the fourth dose. Accumulation of ketorolac tromethamine has not been studied in special populations (geriatric, pediatric, renal failure or hepatic disease patients). Kinetics in Special Populations Geriatric Patients Based on single-dose data only, the half-life of the ketorolac tromethamine racemate increased from 5 to 7 hours in the elderly (65 to 78 years) compared with young healthy volunteers (24 to 35 years) (see Table 2 ). There was little difference in the C max for the two groups (elderly, 2.52 mcg/mL\u00b10.77; young, 2.99 mcg/mL\u00b11.03) (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). Pediatric Patients Limited information is available regarding the pharmacokinetics of dosing of ketorolac tromethamine in the pediatric population. Following a single intravenous bolus dose of 0.5 mg/kg in 10 children 4 to 8 years old, the half-life was 5.8\u00b11.6 hours, the average clearance was 0.042\u00b10.01 L/hr/kg, the volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V \u03b2 ) was 0.34\u00b10.12 L/kg and the volume of distribution at steady state (V ss ) was 0.26\u00b10.08 L/kg. The volume of distribution and clearance of ketorolac in pediatric patients was higher than those observed in adult subjects (see Table 1 ). There are no pharmacokinetic data available for administration of ketorolac tromethamine by the IM route in pediatric patients. Renal Insufficiency Based on single-dose data only, the mean half-life of ketorolac tromethamine in renally impaired patients is between 6 and 19 hours, and is dependent on the extent of the impairment. There is poor correlation between creatinine clearance and total ketorolac tromethamine clearance in the elderly and populations with renal impairment (r=0.5). In patients with renal disease, the AUC \u221e of each enantiomer increased by approximately 100% compared with healthy volunteers. The volume of distribution doubles for the S-enantiomer and increases by 1/5th for the R-enantiomer. The increase in volume of distribution of ketorolac tromethamine implies an increase in unbound fraction. The AUC \u221e -ratio of the ketorolac tromethamine enantiomers in healthy subjects and patients remained similar, indicating there was no selective excretion of either enantiomer in patients compared to healthy subjects (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects ). Hepatic Insufficiency There was no significant difference in estimates of half-life, AUC \u221e and C max in 7 patients with liver disease compared to healthy volunteers (see PRECAUTIONS, Hepatic Effects and Table 2 ). Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified.

Esmolol hydrochloride is: (\u00b1)-Methyl p-[2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino) propoxy] hydrocinnamate hydrochloride and has the following structure: Esmolol hydrochloride has the empirical formula C 16 H 26 NO 4 Cl and a molecular weight of 331.8. It has one asymmetric center and exists as an enantiomeric pair. Esmolol hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is a relatively hydrophilic compound which is very soluble in water and freely soluble in alcohol. Its partition coefficient (octanol/water) at pH 7.0 is 0.42 compared to 17.0 for propranolol. 11.1 Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Dosage Forms Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a clear, colorless to light yellow, sterile, nonpyrogenic, iso-osmotic solution of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride. The formulation is described in the table below: Table 4 Formulation for Esmolol Hydrochloride Injection Esmolol Hydrochloride, USP 10 mg/mL Sodium Chloride, USP 5.9 mg/mL Water for Injection, USP Q.S. to volume of 10 mL Sodium Acetate Trihydrate, USP 2.8 mg/mL Glacial Acetic Acid, USP 0.546 mg/mL Sodium Hydroxide Q.S. to adjust pH to 4.5 to 5.5 Hydrochloric Acid Q.S. to adjust pH to 4.5 to 5.5 Q.S. = Quantity sufficient esmolol-spl-structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Esmolol hydrochloride injection is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride injection inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of esmolol hydrochloride injection, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride injection have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exhibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced effects typical of a beta blocker: a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride injection, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride injection produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride injection was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride injection 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride injection produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride injection was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride injection for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride injection for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hour maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride injection, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride injection for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity.

Decreases in systemic vascular resistance and diastolic blood pressure are observed at low doses of epinephrine because of \u03b2 2 -mediated vasodilation, but are overtaken by \u03b1 1 -mediated peripheral vasoconstriction at higher doses leading to increase in diastolic blood pressure.

Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N 2 O/O 2 /narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 , 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline . Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS.

Figure 3: Duration of Clinical Effect vs. Number of Rocuronium Bromide Maintenance Doses, by Dose Once spontaneous recovery has reached 25% of control T 1 , the neuromuscular block produced by rocuronium bromide is readily reversed with anticholinesterase agents, e.g., edrophonium or neostigmine. The median spontaneous recovery from 25% to 75% T 1 was 13 minutes in adult patients. When neuromuscular block was reversed in 36 adults at a T 1 of 22% to 27%, recovery to a T 1 of 89 (50 to 132)% and T 4 /T 1 of 69 (38 to 92)% was achieved within 5 minutes. Only 5 of 320 adults reversed received an additional dose of reversal agent. The median (range) dose of neostigmine was 0.04 (0.01 to 0.09) mg/kg and the median (range) dose of edrophonium was 0.5 (0.3 to 1.0) mg/kg. In geriatric patients (n=51) reversed with neostigmine, the median T 4 /T 1 increased from 40% to 88% in 5 minutes. In clinical trials with halothane, pediatric patients (n=27) who received 0.5 mg/kg edrophonium had increases in the median T 4 /T 1 from 37% at reversal to 93% after 2 minutes. Pediatric patients (n=58) who received 1 mg/kg edrophonium had increases in the median T 4 /T 1 from 72% at reversal to 100% after 2 minutes. Infants (n=10) who were reversed with 0.03 mg/kg neostigmine recovered from 25% to 75% T 1 within 4 minutes. There were no reports of less than satisfactory clinical recovery of neuromuscular function. The neuromuscular blocking action of rocuronium bromide may be enhanced in the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Hemodynamics There were no dose-related effects on the incidence of changes from baseline (30% or greater) in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) or heart rate associated with rocuronium bromide administration over the dose range of 0.12 to 1.2 mg/kg (4 \u00d7 ED 95 ) within 5 minutes after rocuronium bromide administration and prior to intubation. Increases or decreases in MAP were observed in 2% to 5% of geriatric and other adult patients, and in about 1% of pediatric patients. Heart rate changes (30% or greater) occurred in 0% to 2% of geriatric and other adult patients. Tachycardia (30% or greater) occurred in 12 of 127 pediatric patients. Most of the pediatric patients developing tachycardia were from a single study where the patients were anesthetized with halothane and who did not receive atropine for induction [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . In U.S. studies, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation following rocuronium bromide administration were accompanied by transient tachycardia (30% or greater increases) in about one-third of adult patients under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. Animal studies have indicated that the ratio of vagal:neuromuscular block following rocuronium bromide administration is less than vecuronium but greater than pancuronium. The tachycardia observed in some patients may result from this vagal blocking activity. Histamine Release In studies of histamine release, clinically significant concentrations of plasma histamine occurred in 1 of 88 patients. Clinical signs of histamine release (flushing, rash, or bronchospasm) associated with the administration of rocuronium bromide were assessed in clinical trials and reported in 9 of 1137 (0.8%) patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adult and Geriatric Patients In an effort to maximize the information gathered in the in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, the data from the studies was used to develop population estimates of the parameters for the subpopulations represented (e.g., geriatric, pediatric, renal and hepatic impairment). These population-based estimates and a measure of the estimate variability are contained in the following section. Following intravenous administration of rocuronium bromide, plasma levels of rocuronium follow a three-compartment open model. The rapid distribution half-life is 1 to 2 minutes and the slower distribution half-life is 14 to 18 minutes. Rocuronium is approximately 30% bound to human plasma proteins. In geriatric and other adult surgical patients undergoing either opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen or inhalational anesthesia, the observed pharmacokinetic profile was essentially unchanged [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Table 7: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults (n=22; ages 27 to 58 yrs) and Geriatric (n=20; 65 yrs or greater) During Opioid/Nitrous Oxide/Oxygen Anesthesia PK Parameters Adults (Ages 27 to 58 yrs) Geriatrics ( \u2265 65 yrs) Clearance (L/kg/hr) 0.25 (0.08) 0.21 (0.06) Volume of Distribution at Steady State (L/kg) 0.25 (0.04) 0.22 (0.03) t 1/2 \u03b2 Elimination (hr) 1.4 (0.4) 1.5 (0.4) In general, studies with normal adult subjects did not reveal any differences in the pharmacokinetics of rocuronium due to gender. Studies of distribution, metabolism, and excretion in cats and dogs indicate that rocuronium is eliminated primarily by the liver. The rocuronium analog 17-desacetyl-rocuronium, a metabolite, has been rarely observed in the plasma or urine of humans administered single doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg with or without a subsequent infusion (for up to 12 hr) of rocuronium. In the cat, 17-desacetyl-rocuronium has approximately one-twentieth the neuromuscular blocking potency of rocuronium. The effects of renal failure and hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rocuronium in humans are consistent with these findings. In general, patients undergoing cadaver kidney transplant have a small reduction in clearance which is offset pharmacokinetically by a corresponding increase in volume, such that the net effect is an unchanged plasma half-life. Patients with demonstrated liver cirrhosis have a marked increase in their volume of distribution resulting in a plasma half-life approximately twice that of patients with normal hepatic function. Table 8 shows the pharmacokinetic parameters in subjects with either impaired renal or hepatic function. Table 8: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults with Normal Renal and Hepatic Function (n=10, ages 23 to 65), Renal Transplant Patients (n=10, ages 21 to 45) and Hepatic Dysfunction Patients (n=9, ages 31 to 67) During Isoflurane Anesthesia *Differences in the calculated t 1/2 \u03b2 and Cl between this study and the study in young adults vs. geriatrics (\u226565 years) is related to the different sample populations and anesthetic techniques. PK Parameters Normal Renal and Hepatic Function Renal Transplant Patients Hepatic Dysfunction Patients Clearance (L/kg/hr) 0.16 (0.05)* 0.13 (0.04) 0.13 (0.06) Volume of Distribution at Steady State (L/kg) 0.26 (0.03) 0.34 (0.11) 0.53 (0.14) t 1/2 \u03b2 Elimination (hr) 2.4 (0.8)* 2.4 (1.1) 4.3 (2.6) The net result of these findings is that subjects with renal failure have clinical durations that are similar to but somewhat more variable than the duration that one would expect in subjects with normal renal function. Hepatically impaired patients, due to the large increase in volume, may demonstrate clinical durations approaching 1.5 times that of subjects with normal hepatic function. In both populations the clinician should individualize the dose to the needs of the patient [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Tissue redistribution accounts for most (about 80%) of the initial amount of rocuronium administered. As tissue compartments fill with continued dosing (4 to 8 hours), less drug is redistributed away from the site of action and, for an infusion-only dose, the rate to maintain neuromuscular blockade falls to about 20% of the initial infusion rate. The use of a loading dose and a smaller infusion rate reduces the need for adjustment of dose. Pediatric Patients Under halothane anesthesia, the clinical duration of effects of rocuronium bromide did not vary with age in patients 4 months to 8 years of age. The terminal half-life and other pharmacokinetic parameters of rocuronium in these pediatric patients are presented in Table 9 . Table 9: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Rocuronium in Pediatric Patients (ages 3 to less than 12 mos, n=6; 1 to less than 3 yrs, n=5; 3 to less than 8 yrs, n=7) During Halothane Anesthesia PK Parameters Patient Age Range 3 to <12 mos 1 to <3 yrs 3 to <8 yrs Clearance (L/kg/hr) 0.35 (0.08) 0.32 (0.07) 0.44 (0.16) Volume of Distribution at Steady State (L/kg) 0.30 (0.04) 0.26 (0.06) 0.21 (0.03) t 1/2 \u03b2 Elimination (hr) 1.3 (0.5) 1.1 (0.7) 0.8 (0.3) Pharmacokinetics of rocuronium bromide were evaluated using a population analysis of the pooled pharmacokinetic datasets from 2 trials under sevoflurane (induction) and isoflurane/nitrous oxide (maintenance) anesthesia. All pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be linearly proportional to body weight. In patients under the age of 18 years clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vss) increase with bodyweight (kg) and age (years). As a result the terminal half-life of rocuronium bromide decreases with increasing age from 1.1 hour to 0.7 to 0.8 hour. Table 10 presents the pharmacokinetic parameters in the different age groups in the studies with sevoflurane (induction) and isoflurane/nitrous oxide (maintenance) anesthesia.

Dry sodium nitroprusside, USP available as reddish-brown powder or crystals, freely soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol.

Other smooth muscle (e.g., uterus, duodenum) is not affected. Sodium nitroprusside is more active on veins than on arteries, but this selectivity is much less marked than that of nitroglycerin. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. In association with the decrease in blood pressure, sodium nitroprusside administered intravenously to hypertensive and normotensive patients produces slight increases in heart rate and a variable effect on cardiac output. In hypertensive patients, moderate doses induce renal vasodilatation roughly proportional to the decrease in systemic blood pressure, so there is no appreciable change in renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate. In normotensive subjects, acute reduction of mean arterial pressure to 60 to 75 mm Hg by infusion of sodium nitroprusside caused a significant increase in renin activity. In the same study, ten renovascular-hypertensive patients given sodium nitroprusside had significant increases in renin release from the involved kidney at mean arterial pressures of 90 to 137 mm Hg. The hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside is seen within a minute or two after the start of an adequate infusion, and it dissipates almost as rapidly after an infusion is discontinued. The effect is augmented by ganglionic blocking agents and inhaled anesthetics. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Infused sodium nitroprusside is rapidly distributed to a volume that is approximately coextensive with the extracellular space. The drug is cleared from this volume by intraerythrocytic reaction with hemoglobin (Hgb), and sodium nitroprusside\u2019s resulting circulatory half-life is about 2 minutes. The products of the nitroprusside/hemoglobin reaction are cyanmethemoglobin (cyanmetHgb) and cyanide ion (CN \u2013 ). Safe use of sodium nitroprusside injection must be guided by knowledge of the further metabolism of these products. As shown in the diagram below, the essential features of nitroprusside metabolism are \u2022 one molecule of sodium nitroprusside is metabolized by combination with hemoglobin to produce one molecule of cyanmethemoglobin and four CN \u2013 ions; \u2022 methemoglobin, obtained from hemoglobin, can sequester cyanide as cyanmethemoglobin; \u2022 thiosulfate reacts with cyanide to produce thiocyanate; \u2022 thiocyanate is eliminated in the urine; \u2022 cyanide not otherwise removed binds to cytochromes; and \u2022 cyanide is much more toxic than methemoglobin or thiocyanate. Cyanide ion is normally found in serum; it is derived from dietary substrates and from tobacco smoke. Cyanide binds avidly (but reversibly) to ferric ion (Fe+++), most body stores of which are found in erythrocyte methemoglobin (metHgb) and in mitochondrial cytochromes. When CN \u2013 is infused or generated within the bloodstream, essentially all of it is bound to methemoglobin until intraerythrocytic methemoglobin has been saturated. When the Fe+++ of cytochromes is bound to cyanide, the cytochromes are unable to participate in oxidative metabolism. In this situation, cells may be able to provide for their energy needs by utilizing anaerobic pathways, but they thereby generate an increasing body burden of lactic acid. Other cells may be unable to utilize these alternative pathways, and they may die hypoxic deaths. CN \u2013 levels in packed erythrocytes are typically less than 1 \u03bc mol/L (less than 25 mcg/L); levels are roughly doubled in heavy smokers. At healthy steady state, most people have less than 1% of their hemoglobin in the form of methemoglobin. Nitroprusside metabolism can lead to methemoglobin formation (a) through dissociation of cyanmethemoglobin formed in the original reaction of sodium nitroprusside with Hgb and (b) by direct oxidation of Hgb by the released nitroso group. Relatively large quantities of sodium nitroprusside, however, are required to produce significant methemoglobinemia. At physiologic methemoglobin levels, the CN \u2013 binding capacity of packed red cells is a little less than 200 \u03bc mol/L (5 mg/L). Cytochrome toxicity is seen at levels only slightly higher, and death has been reported at levels from 300 to 3000 \u03bc mol/L (8 to 80 mg/L). Put another way, a patient with a normal red-cell mass (35 mL/kg) and normal methemoglobin levels can buffer about 175 mcg/kg of CN \u2013 , corresponding to a little less than 500 mcg/kg of infused sodium nitroprusside. Some cyanide is eliminated from the body as expired hydrogen cyanide, but most is enzymatically converted to thiocyanate (SCN \u2013 ) by thiosulfate-cyanide sulfur transferase (rhodanase, EC 2.8.1.1), a mitochondrial enzyme. The enzyme is normally present in great excess, so the reaction is rate-limited by the availability of sulfur donors, especially thiosulfate, cystine, and cysteine. Thiosulfate is a normal constituent of serum, produced from cysteine by way of \u03b2-mercaptopyruvate. Physiological levels of thiosulfate are typically about 0.1 mmol/L (11 mg/L), but they are approximately twice this level in pediatric and adult patients who are not eating. Infused thiosulfate is cleared from the body (primarily by the kidneys) with a half-life of about 20 minutes. When thiosulfate is being supplied only by normal physiologic mechanisms, conversion of CN \u2013 to SCN \u2013 generally proceeds at about 1 mcg/kg/min. This rate of CN \u2013 clearance corresponds to steady-state processing of a sodium nitroprusside infusion of slightly more than 2 mcg/kg/min. CN \u2013 begins to accumulate when sodium nitroprusside infusions exceed this rate. Thiocyanate (SCN \u2013 ) is also a normal physiological constituent of serum, with normal levels typically in the range of 50 to 250 \u03bc mol/L (3 to 15 mg/L). Clearance of SCN \u2013 is primarily renal, with a half-life of about 3 days. In renal failure, the half-life can be doubled or tripled. Clinical Trials: Baseline-controlled clinical trials have uniformly shown that sodium nitroprusside has a prompt hypotensive effect, at least initially, in all populations. With increasing rates of infusion, sodium nitroprusside has been able to lower blood pressure without an observed limit of effect. Clinical trials have also shown that the hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside is associated with reduced blood loss in a variety of major surgical procedures. In patients with acute congestive heart failure and increased peripheral vascular resistance, administration of sodium nitroprusside causes reductions in peripheral resistance, increases in cardiac output, and reductions in left ventricular filling pressure. Many trials have verified the clinical significance of the metabolic pathways described above. In patients receiving unopposed infusions of sodium nitroprusside, cyanide and thiocyanate levels have increased with increasing rates of sodium nitroprusside infusion. Mild to moderate metabolic acidosis has usually accompanied higher cyanide levels, but peak base deficits have lagged behind the peak cyanide levels by an hour or more. Progressive tachyphylaxis to the hypotensive effects of sodium nitroprusside has been reported in several trials and numerous case reports. This tachyphylaxis has frequently been attributed to concomitant cyanide toxicity, but the only evidence adduced for this assertion has been the observation that in patients treated with sodium nitroprusside and found to be resistant to its hypotensive effects, cyanide levels are often found to be elevated. In the only reported comparisons of cyanide levels in resistant and nonresistant patients, cyanide levels did not correlate with tachyphylaxis. The mechanism of tachyphylaxis to sodium nitroprusside remains unknown. Pediatric: The effects of sodium nitroprusside to induce hypotension were evaluated in two trials in pediatric patients less than 17 years of age. In both trials, at least 50% of the patients were pre-pubertal, and about 50% of these pre-pubertal patients were less than 2 years of age, including 4 neonates. The primary efficacy variable was the mean arterial pressure (MAP). There were 203 pediatric patients in a parallel, dose-ranging study (Study 1). During the 30 minute blinded phase, patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive sodium nitroprusside 0.3, 1, 2, or 3 mcg/kg/min. The infusion rate was increased step-wise to the target dose rate (i.e., 1/3 of the full rate for the first 5 minutes, 2/3 of the full rate for the next 5 minutes, and the full dose rate for the last 20 minutes). If the investigator believed that an increase to the next higher dose rate would be unsafe, the infusion remained at the current rate for the remainder of the blinded infusion. Since there was no placebo group, the change from baseline likely overestimates the true magnitude of blood pressure effect. Nevertheless, MAP decreased 11 to 20 mmHg from baseline across the four doses (Table 1). There were 63 pediatric patients in a long-term infusion trial (Study 2). During an open-label phase (12 to 24 hours), sodium nitroprusside was started at \u22640.3 mcg/kg/min and titrated according to the BP response. Patients were then randomized to placebo or to continuing the same dose of sodium nitroprusside. The average MAP was greater in the control group than in the sodium nitroprusside group for every time point during the blinded withdrawal phase, demonstrating that sodium nitroprusside is effective for at least 12 hours. In both studies, similar effects on MAP were seen in all age groups.

Allopurinol reduces both the serum and urinary uric acid levels by inhibiting the formation of uric acid. The use of allopurinol to block the formation of urates avoids the hazard of increased renal excretion of uric acid posed by uricosuric drugs. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Allopurinol reduces the production of uric acid by inhibiting the biochemical reactions immediately preceding its formation in a dose dependent manner. The pharmacological action of allopurinol is generally believed to be mediated by its oxypurinol metabolite. Effect on Hypoxanthine and Xanthine Reutilization of both hypoxanthine and xanthine for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis is markedly enhanced when their oxidations are inhibited by allopurinol and oxypurinol. This reutilization does not disrupt normal nucleic acid anabolism because feedback inhibition is an integral part of purine biosynthesis. As a result of xanthine oxidase inhibition, the serum concentration of hypoxanthine plus xanthine in patients receiving allopurinol for treatment of hyperuricemia is usually in the range of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/dL compared to a normal level of approximately 0.15 mg/dL. A maximum of 0.9 mg/dL of these oxypurines has been reported when the serum urate was lowered to less than 2 mg/dL by high doses of allopurinol. These values are far below the saturation levels, at which point their precipitation would be expected to occur (above 7 mg/dL). The increased xanthine and hypoxanthine in the urine in patients who were treated with oral allopurinol have not been accompanied by problems of nephrolithiasis; however, there are isolated case reports of xanthine crystalluria. Drug Interaction Studies Fluorouracil Based on non-clinical data, allopurinol may decrease anti-tumor activity due to suppression of phosphorylation of 5-fluorouracil. Pegloticase Concomitant use of ALOPRIM and pegloticase may potentially blunt the rise of serum uric acid levels required for monitoring the safe use of pegloticase. Cytotoxic Agents Enhanced bone marrow suppression by cyclophosphamide and other cytotoxic agents has been reported among patients with neoplastic disease, except leukemia, in the presence of allopurinol. Thiazide Diuretics Reports that the concomitant administration of allopurinol and thiazide diuretics contributed to increased allopurinol toxicity were reviewed; however, a causal mechanism or cause-and-effect relationship was not found. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following single 100 mg and 300 mg intravenous and oral administration of ALOPRIM, the relative intravenous Cmax was approximately 3-fold and 3.8-fold and AUC 0-inf was approximately 1.9-fold higher for allopurinol at both dosages, respectively. The relative intravenous oxypurinol C max and AUC 0-inf was approximately 1 compaired to oral administration at both dosages. The C max and AUC 0- inf for both allopurinol and oxypurinol following intravenous administration of ALOPRIM were dose proportional in the dose range of 100 to 300 mg. Distribution The steady-state allopurinol volume of distribution (mean \u00b1 S.D.) is approximately 0.87 \u00b1 0.13 L/Kg following intravenous adminstration. Elimination The half-life (mean \u00b1 S.D.) of allopurinol and oxypurinol are approximately 1.21 \u00b1 0.33 and 23.5 \u00b1 4.5 hours following intravenous administration, respectively. The net renal clearance of oxypurinol about 30 mL/min. Metabolism Allopurinol is a weak CYP1A2 inhibitor. Allopurinol is rapidly eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily via oxidative metabolism to oxypurinol. The oxypurinol (alloxanthine) metabolite is also a xanthine oxidase inhibitor and is present in systemic circulation in much higher concentrations and for a much longer period than allopurinol. In general, the ratio of the area under the plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC 0-inf ) between oxypurinol and allopurinol was in the magnitude of 30 to 40. Excretion Approximately 12% of an allopurinol intravenous dose was excreted unchanged, 76% excreted as oxypurinol, and the remaining dose excreted as riboside conjugates in the urine. Oxypurinol was primarily eliminated unchanged in urine by glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption. Drug Interaction Studies Capecitabine Concomitant use with allopurinol may decrease concentration of capecitabine\u2019s active metabolites, which may decrease capecitabine efficacy. Cyclosporine Concomitant use of allopurinol increases cyclosporine concentrations which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Mercaptopurine or Azathioprine Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine and azathioprine. Concomitant use of allopurinol increases the exposure of either mercaptopurine or azathioprine which may increase the risk of their adverse reactions including myelosuppression. Theophylline Concomitant use of allopurinol doses greater than or equal to 600 mg/day may decrease the clearance of theophylline. Uricosuric Agents Uricosuric agents increase the excretion of the active allopurinol metabolite oxypurinol. Concomitant use with uricosuric agents decreases oxypurinol exposure which may reduce the inhibition of xanthine oxidase by oxypurinol and increases the urinary excretion of uric acid. Warfarin Allopurinol may inhibit the metabolism of warfarin, possibly enhancing its anticoagulant effect. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics The HLA-B*58:01 allele is a genetic marker for severe skin reactions indicative of hypersensitivity to allopurinol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

Loss of intracellular potassium ion is usually accompanied by an increase in intracellular sodium ion. When serum sodium concentration is low, the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) by the pituitary is inhibited, thereby preventing water reabsorption by the distal renal tubules.

It is an even more potent inhibitor of GH, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, VIP, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and VIP secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Octreotide substantially reduces GH and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Single doses of octreotide have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Octreotide suppresses secretion of TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site. Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, IV and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent. Peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values were dose proportional after IV single doses up to 200 mcg and subcutaneous single doses up to 500 mcg and after subcutaneous multiple doses up to 500 mcg 3 times a day (1,500 mcg/day). In patients with acromegaly, a mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100-mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing. Distribution In healthy volunteers, the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (t\u03b1\u00bd = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr. In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner. Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. In patients with acromegaly, the volume of distribution (V dss ) was estimated to be 21.6 \u00b1 8.5 L, and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h. The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%. Elimination The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone. The duration of action of octreotide acetate injection is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor. About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine. In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug. In patients with acromegaly, the disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normal subjects. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR 40 to 60 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (CL CR 10 to 39 mL/min) t 1/2 was 3.0 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr. In patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CL CR < 10 mL/min), octreotide t 1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr.

The deficiency of ASM causes an intra-lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin (as well as cholesterol and other cell membrane lipids) in various tissues. XENPOZYME provides an exogenous source of ASM. XENPOZYME is not expected to cross the blood-brain barrier or modulate the CNS manifestations of ASMD. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Plasma Ceramide Levels Ceramide is elevated in plasma of adult and pediatric patients with ASMD. Plasma ceramide levels showed a transient increase after each administration (post infusion) of XENPOZYME. In the dose escalation phase, plasma ceramide levels were substantially increased compared to the baseline level. Plasma ceramide levels gradually decreased following repeated administration of XENPOZYME and the pre-infusion levels were generally lower than the baseline level during the maintenance phase of treatment. In adult patients with ASMD in Trial 1 [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] , the mean (standard deviation, SD) pre-infusion plasma ceramide concentration was 3.7 (1.4) mg/L at baseline and decreased to 2.2 (0.6) mg/L at Week 52 following treatment with XENPOZYME.

Plasma Lysosphingomyelin Levels Lysosphingomyelin is substantially elevated in plasma of adult and pediatric patients with ASMD. Plasma lysosphingomyelin levels decreased after repeated administration of XENPOZYME. In adult patients with ASMD in Trial 1 [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] , the mean (SD) pre-infusion plasma lysosphingomyelin concentration was 379 (204) mcg/L at baseline and decreased to 99 (118) mcg/L at Week 52 following treatment with XENPOZYME. In pediatric patients with ASMD in Trial 2 [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , the mean (SD) pre-infusion plasma lysosphingomyelin concentration was 625 (339) mcg/L at baseline and decreased to 80 (47) mcg/L at Week 52 following treatment with XENPOZYME. Liver Sphingomyelin Content In adult patients, the liver sphingomyelin content, as assessed by histopathology, decreased from baseline to Week 52 in the XENPOZYME treatment group compared to an increase in the placebo group. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In adult patients with ASMD, the mean (SD) maximum plasma olipudase alfa-rpcp concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) at steady state were 30 (5) mcg/mL and 607 (120) mcg\u2219h/mL, respectively, at the recommended maintenance dose of 3 mg/kg administered once every 2 weeks. Olipudase alfa-rpcp C max and AUC increase proportionally over a dose range of 0.1 to 3 mg/kg (0.03 to 1 times the approved recommended maintenance dose). Distribution The mean (SD) volume of distribution of olipudase alfa-rpcp was 13 (2) L in adult patients with ASMD.

Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection inhibits the beta1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacology studies in normal volunteers have confirmed the beta blocking activity of Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, showing reduction in heart rate at rest and during exercise, and attenuation of isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate. Blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection have been shown to correlate with extent of beta blockade. After termination of infusion, substantial recovery from beta blockade is observed in 10 to 20 minutes. The acid metabolite of esmolol exihibits negligible pharmacological activity. In human electrophysiology studies, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced effects typical of a beta blocker; a decrease in the heart rate, increase in sinus cycle length, prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, prolongation of the AH interval during normal sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in antegrade Wenckebach cycle length. In patients undergoing radionuclide angiography, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, at dosages of 200 mcg/kg/min, produced reductions in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index at rest, which were similar in magnitude to those produced by intravenous propranolol (4 mg). During exercise, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced reductions in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index which were also similar to those produced by propranolol, but esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood pressure. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the maximum therapeutic dose of 300 mcg/kg/min of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced similar effects and, in addition, there were small, clinically insignificant increases in the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 30 minutes after the discontinuation of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned to pretreatment levels. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection was demonstrated in 10 mildly asthmatic patients. Infusions of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection 100, 200 and 300 mcg/kg/min produced no significant increases in specific airway resistance compared to placebo. At 300 mcg/kg/min, esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor sensitivity to dry air stimulus. These effects were not clinically significant, and esmolol hydrochloride was well tolerated by all patients. Six of the patients also received intravenous propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, two experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm requiring bronchodilator treatment. One other propranolol-treated patient also experienced dry air-induced bronchospasm. No adverse pulmonary effects were observed in patients with COPD who received therapeutic dosages of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (51 patients) or in perioperative settings (32 patients). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes. Using an appropriate loading dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for dosages from 50 to 300 mcg/kg/min are obtained within five minutes. Steady-state is reached in about 30 minutes without the loading dose. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over this range. Steady-state blood levels are maintained during infusion but decrease rapidly after termination of the infusion. Because of its short half-life, blood levels of esmolol can be rapidly altered by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate and rapidly eliminated by discontinuing the infusion. Consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Within 24 hours of the end of infusion, the acid metabolite of esmolol in urine accounts for approximately 73 to 88% of the dosage. Metabolism of esmolol results in the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol. The acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have negligible activity, and in normal volunteers its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta blockade. The acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 3.7 hours and is excreted in the urine with a clearance approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. After a 4 hours maintenance infusion of 150 mcg/kg, the plasma concentrations of esmolol are similar in subjects with normal renal function and in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The half-life of the acid metabolite of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, is increased about 12-fold to 48 hours in patients with ESRD. The peak concentrations of the acid metabolite are doubled in ESRD. Methanol blood levels, monitored in subjects receiving esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection for up to 6 hours at 300 mcg/kg/min and 24 hours at 150 mcg/kg/min, approximated endogenous levels and were less than 2% of levels usually associated with methanol toxicity. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection has been shown to be 55% bound to human plasma protein, while the acid metabolite is only 10% bound."], "manufacturer_name": ["Mylan Institutional LLC"], "substance_name": ["ESMOLOL HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20171231", "product_ndc": ["67457-657", "67457-658"], "brand_name": ["esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride"]}

In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor added to bupivacaine to slow absorption into the general circulation and thus prolong maintenance of an active tissue concentration. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic absorption of bupivacaine produces effects on the cardiovascular system and CNS. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. These cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Following systemic absorption, bupivacaine can produce CNS stimulation, CNS depression, or both. Apparent central stimulation is manifested as restlessness, tremors, and shivering, progressing to convulsions, followed by CNS depression and coma progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest. However, bupivacaine has a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited state. The duration of local anesthesia after administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is longer than that observed after administration of other commonly used short-acting local anesthetics. There appears to be period of analgesia that persists after the resolution of the block and return of sensation. The onset of action following dental injections is usually 2 to 10 minutes and may last up to 7 hours. The duration of anesthetic effect is prolonged by the addition of epinephrine 1:200,000. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection do not correlate with local efficacy. Absorption The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000) usually reduces the rate of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine, permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and sometimes prolonging the duration of action [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After injection of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next three to six hours. Distribution Bupivacaine appears to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of bupivacaine appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity (95%) has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4). The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, bupivacaine is distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profile of bupivacaine after direct intravenous injection (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is not approved for intravenous use) suggest a three-compartment open model. The first compartment is represented by the rapid intravascular distribution of the drug. The second compartment represents the equilibration of the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as the brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and liver. The third compartment represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly perfused tissues, such as muscle and fat. Elimination The half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours. Metabolism Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine. The elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely upon the availability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized. Excretion The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Elderly patients exhibited higher peak plasma concentrations than younger patients following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection. The total plasma clearance was decreased in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic disease. Patients with hepatic disease, especially those with severe hepatic disease, may be more susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local anesthetics [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of renal disease, factors affecting urinary pH, and renal blood flow [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.7) ] .", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt retaining properties, are used in replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are used primarily for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine hydrochloride stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine hydrochloride is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine hydrochloride is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine hydrochloride crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine hydrochloride. Approximately 90% of lidocaine hydrochloride administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine hydrochloride following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine hydrochloride required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl\u203e) ions. These ions are normal constituents of the body fluids (principally extracellular) and are essential for maintaining electrolyte balance.

In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor added to bupivacaine to slow absorption into the general circulation and thus prolong maintenance of an active tissue concentration. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic absorption of bupivacaine produces effects on the cardiovascular system and CNS. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. These cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Following systemic absorption, bupivacaine can produce CNS stimulation, CNS depression, or both. Apparent central stimulation is manifested as restlessness, tremors, and shivering, progressing to convulsions, followed by CNS depression and coma progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest. However, bupivacaine has a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited state. The duration of local anesthesia after administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is longer than that observed after administration of other commonly used short-acting local anesthetics. There appears to be period of analgesia that persists after the resolution of the block and return of sensation. The onset of action following dental injections is usually 2 to 10 minutes and may last up to 7 hours. The duration of anesthetic effect is prolonged by the addition of epinephrine 1:200,000. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection do not correlate with local efficacy. Absorption The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000) usually reduces the rate of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine, permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and sometimes prolonging the duration of action [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After injection of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next three to six hours. Distribution Bupivacaine appears to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of bupivacaine appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity (95%) has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4). The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, bupivacaine is distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profile of bupivacaine after direct intravenous injection (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is not approved for intravenous use) suggest a three-compartment open model. The first compartment is represented by the rapid intravascular distribution of the drug. The second compartment represents the equilibration of the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as the brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and liver. The third compartment represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly perfused tissues, such as muscle and fat. Elimination The half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours. Metabolism Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine. The elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely upon the availability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized. Excretion The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Elderly patients exhibited higher peak plasma concentrations than younger patients following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection. The total plasma clearance was decreased in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic disease. Patients with hepatic disease, especially those with severe hepatic disease, may be more susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local anesthetics [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of renal disease, factors affecting urinary pH, and renal blood flow [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.7) ] .", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt retaining properties, are used in replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are used primarily for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine hydrochloride stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine hydrochloride is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine hydrochloride is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine hydrochloride crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine hydrochloride. Approximately 90% of lidocaine hydrochloride administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine hydrochloride following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine hydrochloride required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl\u203e) ions. These ions are normal constituents of the body fluids (principally extracellular) and are essential for maintaining electrolyte balance.

While ondansetron\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, it is not a dopamine-receptor antagonist. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In normal volunteers, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. In another trial in six normal male volunteers, a 16 mg dose infused over 5 minutes showed no effect of the drug on cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, blood pressure, or ECG. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in normal volunteers. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations. In a gender-balanced pharmacodynamic trial (n = 56), ondansetron 4 mg administered intravenously or intramuscularly was dynamically similar in the prevention of nausea and vomiting using the ipecacuanha model of emesis. Cardiac Electrophysiology QTc interval prolongation was studied in a double blind, single intravenous dose, placebo- and positive-controlled, crossover trial in 58 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction was 19.5 (21.8) ms and 5.6 (7.4) ms after 15 minute intravenous infusions of 32 mg and 8 mg ondansetron, respectively. A significant exposure-response relationship was identified between ondansetron concentration and \u0394\u0394QTcF. Using the established exposure-response relationship, 24 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes had a mean predicted (95% upper prediction interval) \u0394\u0394QTcF of 14.0 (16.3) ms. In contrast, 16 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes using the same model had a mean predicted (95% upper prediction interval) \u0394\u0394QTcF of 9.1 (11.2) ms. In this study, the 8-mg dose infused over 15 minutes did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In normal adult volunteers, the following mean pharmacokinetic data have been determined following a single 0.15-mg/kg intravenous dose. Table 4. Pharmacokinetics in Normal Adult Volunteers Age-group (years) n Peak Plasma Concentration (ng/mL) Mean Elimination Half-life (h) Plasma Clearance (L/h/kg) 19 to 40 11 102 3.5 0.381 61 to 74 12 106 4.7 0.319 \u2265 75 11 170 5.5 0.262 Absorption A trial was performed in normal volunteers (n = 56) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single 4-mg dose administered as a 5-minute infusion compared with a single intramuscular injection. Systemic exposure as measured by mean AUC were equivalent, with values of 156 [95% CI 136, 180] and 161 [95% CI 137, 190] ng \u00b7 h/mL for intravenous and intramuscular groups, respectively. Mean peak plasma concentrations were 42.9 [95% CI 33.8, 54.4] ng/mL at 10 minutes after intravenous infusion and 31.9 [95% CI 26.3, 38.6] ng/mL at 41 minutes after intramuscular injection. Distribution Plasma protein binding of ondansetron as measured in vitro was 70% to 76%, over the pharmacologic concentration range of 10 to 500 ng/mL. Circulating drug also distributes into erythrocytes. Elimination Metabolism: Ondansetron is extensively metabolized in humans, with approximately 5% of a radiolabeled dose recovered as the parent compound from the urine. The primary metabolic pathway is hydroxylation on the indole ring followed by subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. Although some nonconjugated metabolites have pharmacologic activity, these are not found in plasma at concentrations likely to significantly contribute to the biological activity of ondansetron. The metabolites are observed in the urine. In vitro metabolism studies have shown that ondansetron is a substrate for multiple human hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. In terms of overall ondansetron turnover, CYP3A4 plays a predominant role while formation of the major in vivo metabolites is apparently mediated by CYP1A2. The role of CYP2D6 in ondansetron in vivo metabolism is relatively minor. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous ondansetron did not differ between subjects who were poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 and those who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, further supporting the limited role of CYP2D6 in ondansetron disposition in vivo . Excretion : In adult cancer patients, the mean ondansetron elimination half-life was 4.0 hours, and there was no difference in the multidose pharmacokinetics over a 4-day period. In a dose-proportionality trial, systemic exposure to 32 mg of ondansetron was not proportional to dose as measured by comparing dose-normalized AUC values with an 8-mg dose. This is consistent with a small decrease in systemic clearance with increasing plasma concentrations. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: A reduction in clearance and increase in elimination half-life are seen in patients older than75 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 )]. Pediatric Patients: Pharmacokinetic samples were collected from 74 cancer patients aged 6 to 48 months, who received a dose of 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron every 4 hours for 3 doses during a safety and efficacy trial. These data were combined with sequential pharmacokinetics data from 41 surgery patients aged 1 month to 24 months, who received a single dose of 0.1 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron prior to surgery with general anesthesia, and a population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on the combined data set. The results of this analysis are included in Table 5 and are compared with the pharmacokinetic results in cancer patients aged 4 to 18 years. Table 5. Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Cancer Patients Aged 1 Month to 18 Years Subjects and Age Group CL (L/h/kg) Vd ss (L/kg) t \u00bd (h) N Geometric Mean Mean Pediatric Cancer Patients 4 to 18 years N = 21 0.599 1.9 2.8 Population PK Patients a 1 month to 48 months N = 115 0.582 3.65 4.9 a Population PK (Pharmacokinetic) Patients: 64% cancer patients and 36% surgery patients. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, cancer patients aged 6 to 48 months who receive a dose of 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron every 4 hours for 3 doses would be expected to achieve a systemic exposure (AUC) consistent with the exposure achieved in previous pediatric trials in cancer patients (4 to 18 years) at similar doses. In a trial of 21 pediatric patients (3 to 12 years) who were undergoing surgery requiring anesthesia for a duration of 45 minutes to 2 hours, a single intravenous dose of ondansetron, 2 mg (3 to 7 years) or 4 mg (8 to 12 years), was administered immediately prior to anesthesia induction. Mean weight-normalized clearance and volume of distribution values in these pediatric surgical patients were similar to those previously reported for young adults. Mean terminal half-life was slightly reduced in pediatric patients (range: 2.5 to 3 hours) in comparison with adults (range: 3 to 3.5 hours). In a trial of 51 pediatric patients (aged 1 month to 24 months) who were undergoing surgery requiring general anesthesia, a single intravenous dose of ondansetron, 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg, was administered prior to surgery. As shown in Table 6, the 41 patients with pharmacokinetic data were divided into 2 groups, patients aged 1 month to 4 months and patients aged 5 to 24 months, and are compared with pediatric patients aged 3 to 12 years. Table 6. Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Surgery Patients Aged 1 Month to 12 Years Subjects and Age Group CL (L/h/kg) Vd ss (L/kg) t 1/2 (h) N Geometric Mean Mean Pediatric Surgery Patients 3 to 12 years N = 21 0.439 1.65 2.9 Pediatric Surgery Patients 5 to 24 months N = 22 0.581 2.3 2.9 Pediatric Surgery Patients 1 month to 4 months N = 19 0.401 3.5 6.7 In general, surgical and cancer pediatric patients younger than 18 years tend to have a higher ondansetron clearance compared with adults leading to a shorter half-life in most pediatric patients. In patients aged 1 month to 4 months, a longer half-life was observed due to the higher volume of distribution in this age-group. In a trial of 21 pediatric cancer patients (aged 4 to 18 years) who received three intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron at 4-hour intervals, patients older than 15 years exhibited ondansetron pharmacokinetic parameters similar to those of adults. Patients with Renal Impairment: Due to the very small contribution (5%) of renal clearance to the overall clearance, renal impairment was not expected to significantly influence the total clearance of ondansetron. However, ondansetron mean plasma clearance was reduced by about 41% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). This reduction in clearance is variable and was not consistent with an increase in half-life. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: In patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced 2-fold and mean half-life is increased to 11.6 hours compared with 5.7 hours in those without hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10 or greater), clearance is reduced 2-fold to 3-fold and apparent volume of distribution is increased with a resultant increase in half-life to 20 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.6 )]. Drug Interaction Studies CYP 3A4 Inducers: Ondansetron elimination may be affected by cytochrome P-450 inducers. In a pharmacokinetic trial of 16 epileptic patients maintained chronically on CYP3A4 inducers, carbamazepine, or phenytoin, a reduction in AUC, C max , and t \u00bd of ondansetron was observed. This resulted in a significant increase in the clearance of ondansetron. In a pharmacokinetic study of 10 healthy subjects receiving a single-dose intravenous dose of ondansetron 8 mg after 600 mg rifampin once daily for five days, the AUC and the t\u00bd of ondansetron were reduced by 48% and 46%, respectively. These changes in ondansetron exposure with CYP3A4 inducers are not thought to be clinically relevant [see Drug Interactions (7.3 )] .

Other smooth muscle (e.g., uterus, duodenum) is not affected. Sodium nitroprusside is more active on veins than on arteries, but this selectivity is much less marked than that of nitroglycerin. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. In association with the decrease in blood pressure, sodium nitroprusside administered intravenously to hypertensive and normotensive patients produces slight increases in heart rate and a variable effect on cardiac output. In hypertensive patients, moderate doses induce renal vasodilatation roughly proportional to the decrease in systemic blood pressure, so there is no appreciable change in renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate. In normotensive subjects, acute reduction of mean arterial pressure to 60 to 75 mm Hg by infusion of sodium nitroprusside caused a significant increase in renin activity. In the same study, ten renovascular-hypertensive patients given sodium nitroprusside had significant increases in renin release from the involved kidney at mean arterial pressures of 90 to 137 mm Hg. The hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside is seen within a minute or two after the start of an adequate infusion, and it dissipates almost as rapidly after an infusion is discontinued. The effect is augmented by ganglionic blocking agents and inhaled anesthetics. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Infused sodium nitroprusside is rapidly distributed to a volume that is approximately coextensive with the extracellular space. The drug is cleared from this volume by intraerythrocytic reaction with hemoglobin (Hgb), and sodium nitroprusside\u2019s resulting circulatory half-life is about 2 minutes. The products of the nitroprusside/hemoglobin reaction are cyanmethemoglobin (cyanmetHgb) and cyanide ion (CN - ). Safe use of sodium nitroprusside injection must be guided by knowledge of the further metabolism of these products. As shown in the diagram below, the essential features of nitroprusside metabolism are one molecule of sodium nitroprusside is metabolized by combination with hemoglobin to produce one molecule of cyanmethemoglobin and four CN - ions; methemoglobin, obtained from hemoglobin, can sequester cyanide as cyanmethemoglobin; thiosulfate reacts with cyanide to produce thiocyanate; thiocyanate is eliminated in the urine; cyanide not otherwise removed binds to cytochromes; and cyanide is much more toxic than methemoglobin or thiocyanate. Cyanide ion is normally found in serum; it is derived from dietary substrates and from tobacco smoke. Cyanide binds avidly (but reversibly) to ferric ion (Fe +++ ), most body stores of which are found in erythrocyte methemoglobin (metHgb) and in mitochondrial cytochromes. When CN \u2013 is infused or generated within the bloodstream, essentially all of it is bound to methemoglobin until intraerythrocytic methemoglobin has been saturated. When the Fe +++ of cytochromes is bound to cyanide, the cytochromes are unable to participate in oxidative metabolism. In this situation, cells may be able to provide for their energy needs by utilizing anaerobic pathways, but they thereby generate an increasing body burden of lactic acid. Other cells may be unable to utilize these alternative pathways, and they may die hypoxic deaths. CN \u2013 levels in packed erythrocytes are typically less than 1 mcmol/L (less than 25 mcg/L); levels are roughly doubled in heavy smokers. At healthy steady state, most people have less than 1% of their hemoglobin in the form of methemoglobin. Nitroprusside metabolism can lead to methemoglobin formation (a) through dissociation of cyanmethemoglobin formed in the original reaction of sodium nitroprusside with Hgb and (b) by direct oxidation of Hgb by the released nitroso group. Relatively large quantities of sodium nitroprusside, however, are required to produce significant methemoglobinemia. At physiologic methemoglobin levels, the CN \u2013 binding capacity of packed red cells is a little less than 200 mcmol/L (5 mg/L). Cytochrome toxicity is seen at levels only slightly higher, and death has been reported at levels from 300 to 3000 mcmol/L (8 to 80 mg/L). Put another way, a patient with a normal red-cell mass (35 mL/kg) and normal methemoglobin levels can buffer about 175 mcg/kg of CN \u2013 , corresponding to a little less than 500 mcg/kg of infused sodium nitroprusside. Some cyanide is eliminated from the body as expired hydrogen cyanide, but most is enzymatically converted to thiocyanate (SCN \u2013 ) by thiosulfate-cyanide sulfur transferase (rhodanase, EC 2.8.1.1), a mitochondrial enzyme. The enzyme is normally present in great excess, so the reaction is rate-limited by the availability of sulfur donors, especially thiosulfate, cystine, and cysteine. Thiosulfate is a normal constituent of serum, produced from cysteine by way of \u03b2-mercaptopyruvate. Physiological levels of thiosulfate are typically about 0.1 mmol/L (11 mg/L), but they are approximately twice this level in pediatric and adult patients who are not eating. Infused thiosulfate is cleared from the body (primarily by the kidneys) with a half-life of about 20 minutes. When thiosulfate is being supplied only by normal physiologic mechanisms, conversion of CN \u2013 to SCN \u2013 generally proceeds at about 1 mcg/kg/min. This rate of CN \u2013 clearance corresponds to steady-state processing of a sodium nitroprusside infusion of slightly more than 2 mcg/kg/min. CN \u2013 begins to accumulate when sodium nitroprusside infusions exceed this rate. Thiocyanate (SCN \u2013 ) is also a normal physiological constituent of serum, with normal levels typically in the range of 50 to 250 mcmol/L (3 to 15 mg/L). Clearance of SCN \u2013 is primarily renal, with a half-life of about 3 days. In renal failure, the half-life can be doubled or tripled. Clinical Trials: Baseline-controlled clinical trials have uniformly shown that sodium nitroprusside has a prompt hypotensive effect, at least initially, in all populations. With increasing rates of infusion, sodium nitroprusside has been able to lower blood pressure without an observed limit of effect. Clinical trials have also shown that the hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside is associated with reduced blood loss in a variety of major surgical procedures. In patients with acute congestive heart failure and increased peripheral vascular resistance, administration of sodium nitroprusside causes reductions in peripheral resistance, increases in cardiac output, and reductions in left ventricular filling pressure. Many trials have verified the clinical significance of the metabolic pathways described above. In patients receiving unopposed infusions of sodium nitroprusside, cyanide and thiocyanate levels have increased with increasing rates of sodium nitroprusside infusion. Mild to moderate metabolic acidosis has usually accompanied higher cyanide levels, but peak base deficits have lagged behind the peak cyanide levels by an hour or more. Progressive tachyphylaxis to the hypotensive effects of sodium nitroprusside has been reported in several trials and numerous case reports. This tachyphylaxis has frequently been attributed to concomitant cyanide toxicity, but the only evidence adduced for this assertion has been the observation that in patients treated with sodium nitroprusside and found to be resistant to its hypotensive effects, cyanide levels are often found to be elevated. In the only reported comparisons of cyanide levels in resistant and nonresistant patients, cyanide levels did not correlate with tachyphylaxis. The mechanism of tachyphylaxis to sodium nitroprusside remains unknown. Pediatric: The effects of sodium nitroprusside to induce hypotension were evaluated in two trials in pediatric patients less than 17 years of age. In both trials, at least 50% of the patients were pre-pubertal, and about 50% of these pre-pubertal patients were less than 2 years of age, including 4 neonates. The primary efficacy variable was the mean arterial pressure (MAP). There were 203 pediatric patients in a parallel, dose-ranging study (Study 1). During the 30 minute blinded phase, patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive sodium nitroprusside 0.3, 1, 2, or 3 mcg/kg/min. The infusion rate was increased step-wise to the target dose rate (i.e., 1/3 of the full rate for the first 5 minutes, 2/3 of the full rate for the next 5 minutes, and the full dose rate for the last 20 minutes). If the investigator believed that an increase to the next higher dose rate would be unsafe, the infusion remained at the current rate for the remainder of the blinded infusion. Since there was no placebo group, the change from baseline likely overestimates the true magnitude of blood pressure effect. Nevertheless, MAP decreased 11 to 20 mmHg from baseline across the four doses (Table 1). There were 63 pediatric patients in a long-term infusion trial (Study 2). During an open-label phase (12 to 24 hours), sodium nitroprusside was started at \u22640.3 mcg/kg/min and titrated according to the BP response. Patients were then randomized to placebo or to continuing the same dose of sodium nitroprusside. The average MAP was greater in the control group than in the sodium nitroprusside group for every time point during the blinded withdrawal phase, demonstrating that sodium nitroprusside is effective for at least 12 hours. In both studies, similar effects on MAP were seen in all age groups.

The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with daptomycin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Daptomycin Administered over a 30-Minute Period in Adults The mean and standard deviation (SD) pharmacokinetic parameters of daptomycin at steady-state following intravenous (IV) administration of daptomycin over a 30-minute period at 4 to 12 mg/kg every 24h to healthy young adults are summarized in Table 11.

Daptomycin pharmacokinetics were generally linear and time-independent at daptomycin doses of 4 to 12 mg/kg every 24h administered by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for up to 14 days. Steady-state trough concentrations were achieved by the third daily dose. The mean (SD) steady-state trough concentrations attained following the administration of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg every 24h were 5.9 (1.6), 6.7 (1.6), 10.3 (5.5), 12.9 (2.9), and 13.7 (5.2) mcg/mL, respectively. Daptomycin Administered over a 2-Minute Period in Adults Following IV administration of daptomycin over a 2-minute period to healthy adult volunteers at doses of 4 mg/kg (N=8) and 6 mg/kg (N=12), the mean (SD) steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) values were 475 (71) and 701 (82) mcg\u2022h/mL, respectively. Values for maximum plasma concentration (C max ) at the end of the 2-minute period could not be determined adequately in this study. However, using pharmacokinetic parameters from 14 healthy adult volunteers who received a single dose of daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 30-minute period in a separate study, steady-state C max values were simulated for daptomycin 4 and 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 2-minute period. The simulated mean (SD) steady-state C max values were 77.7 (8.1) and 116.6 (12.2) mcg/mL, respectively. Distribution Daptomycin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin, in a concentration-independent manner. The overall mean binding ranges from 90 to 93%. In clinical studies, mean serum protein binding in adult subjects with creatinine clearance (CL CR ) \u226530 mL/min was comparable to that observed in healthy adult subjects with normal renal function. However, there was a trend toward decreasing serum protein binding among subjects with CL CR <30 mL/min (88%), including those receiving hemodialysis (86%) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (84%). The protein binding of daptomycin in adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was similar to that in healthy adult subjects. The volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) of daptomycin in healthy adult subjects was approximately 0.1 L/kg and was independent of dose. Metabolism In in vitro studies, daptomycin was not metabolized by human liver microsomes. In 5 healthy adults after infusion of radiolabeled 14 C-daptomycin, the plasma total radioactivity was similar to the concentration determined by microbiological assay. Inactive metabolites were detected in urine, as determined by the difference between total radioactive concentrations and microbiologically active concentrations. In a separate study, no metabolites were observed in plasma on Day 1 following the administration of daptomycin at 6 mg/kg to adult subjects. Minor amounts of three oxidative metabolites and one unidentified compound were detected in urine. The site of metabolism has not been identified. Excretion Daptomycin is excreted primarily by the kidneys. In a mass balance study of 5 healthy adult subjects using radiolabeled daptomycin, approximately 78% of the administered dose was recovered from urine based on total radioactivity (approximately 52% of the dose based on microbiologically active concentrations), and 5.7% of the administered dose was recovered from feces (collected for up to 9 days) based on total radioactivity. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Population-derived pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for infected adult patients (complicated skin and skin structure infections [cSSSI] and S. aureus bacteremia) and noninfected adult subjects with various degrees of renal function (Table 12). Total plasma clearance (CL T ), elimination half-life (t 1/2 ), and volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) in patients with cSSSI were similar to those in patients with S. aureus bacteremia. Following administration of daptomycin 4 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean CL T was 9%, 22%, and 46% lower among subjects and patients with mild (CL CR 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (CL CR 30 to <50 mL/min), and severe (CL CR <30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, than in those with normal renal function (CL CR >80 mL/min). The mean steady-state systemic exposure (AUC), t 1/2 , and V ss increased with decreasing renal function, although the mean AUC for patients with CL CR 30 to 80 mL/min was not markedly different from the mean AUC for patients with normal renal function. The mean AUC for patients with CL CR <30 mL/min and for patients on dialysis (CAPD and hemodialysis dosed post-dialysis) was approximately 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, than for patients with normal renal function. The mean C max ranged from 60 to 70 mcg/mL in patients with CL CR \u226530 mL/min, while the mean C max for patients with CL CR <30 mL/min ranged from 41 to 58 mcg/mL. After administration of daptomycin 6 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean C max ranged from 80 to 114 mcg/mL in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and was similar to that of patients with normal renal function.

Because renal excretion is the primary route of elimination, adjustment of daptomycin dosage interval is necessary in adult patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 10 adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and compared with those in healthy adult volunteers (N=9) matched for gender, age, and weight. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were not altered in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is warranted when daptomycin is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been evaluated. Gender No clinically significant gender-related differences in daptomycin pharmacokinetics have been observed. No dosage adjustment is warranted based on gender when daptomycin is administered. Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 12 healthy elderly subjects (\u226575 years of age) and 11 healthy young adult controls (18 to 30 years of age). Following administration of a single 4 mg/kg dose of daptomycin by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean total clearance of daptomycin was approximately 35% lower and the mean AUC 0 to \u221e was approximately 58% higher in elderly subjects than in healthy young adult subjects. There were no differences in C max [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Obese Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 6 moderately obese (Body Mass Index [BMI] 25 to 39.9 kg/m 2 ) and 6 extremely obese (BMI \u226540 kg/m 2 ) adult subjects and controls matched for age, gender, and renal function. Following administration of daptomycin by IV infusion over a 30-minute period as a single 4 mg/kg dose based on total body weight, the total plasma clearance of daptomycin normalized to total body weight was approximately 15% lower in moderately obese subjects and 23% lower in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The AUC 0 to \u221e of daptomycin was approximately 30% higher in moderately obese subjects and 31% higher in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The differences were most likely due to differences in the renal clearance of daptomycin. No adjustment of daptomycin dosage is warranted in obese patients. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric subjects was evaluated in 3 single-dose pharmacokinetic studies. In general, body weight-normalized total body clearance in pediatric patients was higher than in adults and increased with a decrease of age, whereas elimination half-life tends to decrease with a decrease of age. Body weight-normalized total body clearance and elimination half-life of daptomycin in children 2 to 6 years of age were similar at different doses. A study was conducted to assess safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric patients (1 to 17 years old, inclusive) with cSSSI caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Patients were enrolled into 4 age groups [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , and intravenous daptomycin doses of 5 to 10 mg/kg once daily were administered. Following administration of multiple doses, daptomycin exposure (AUC ss and C max,ss ) was similar across different age groups after dose adjustment based on body weight and age (Table 13).

Patients were enrolled into 3 age groups [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] , and intravenous doses of 7 to 12 mg/kg once daily were administered. Following administration of multiple doses, daptomycin exposure (AUC ss and Cmax,ss ) was similar across different age groups after dose adjustment based on body weight and age (Table 14). Table 14: Mean (SD) of Daptomycin Pharmacokinetics in Bacteremia Pediatric Patients Age Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg/kg) Infusion Duration (min) AUCss (mcg\u2022h/mL) t1/2 (h) Vss (mL) CLT (mL/h/kg) Cmax,ss (mcg/mL) 12 to 17 years (N=13) 7 30 656 (334) 7.5 (2.3) 6420 (1980) 12.4 (3.9) 104 (35.5) 7 to 11 years (N=19) 9 30 579 (116) 6.0 (0.8) 4510 (1470) 15.9 (2.8) 104 (14.5) 2 to 6 years (N=19) 12 60 620 (109) 5.1 (0.6) 2200 (570) 19.9 (3.4) 106 (12.8) AUC ss , area under the concentration-time curve at steady state; CLT, clearance normalized to body weight; V ss , volume of distribution at steady state; t \u00bd , terminal half-life No patients 1 to <2 years of age were enrolled in the study. Simulation using a population pharmacokinetic model demonstrated that the AUCss of daptomycin in pediatric patients 1 to <2 years of age receiving 12 mg/kg once daily would be comparable to that in adult patients receiving 6 mg/kg once daily. Drug Interactions Studies In Vitro Studies In vitro studies with human hepatocytes indicate that daptomycin does not inhibit or induce the activities of the following human cytochrome P450 isoforms: 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. It is unlikely that daptomycin will inhibit or induce the metabolism of drugs metabolized by the P450 system. Aztreonam In a study in which 15 healthy adult subjects received a single dose of daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV and a combination dose of daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV and aztreonam 1 g IV, administered over a 30-minute period, the C max and AUC 0 to \u221e of daptomycin were not significantly altered by aztreonam. Tobramycin In a study in which 6 healthy adult males received a single dose of daptomycin 2 mg/kg IV, tobramycin 1 mg/kg IV, and both in combination, administered over a 30-minute period, the mean C max and AUC 0 to \u221e of daptomycin were 12.7% and 8.7% higher, respectively, when daptomycin was coadministered with tobramycin. The mean C max and AUC 0 to \u221e of tobramycin were 10.7% and 6.6% lower, respectively, when tobramycin was coadministered with daptomycin. These differences were not statistically significant. The interaction between daptomycin and tobramycin with a clinical dose of daptomycin is unknown. Warfarin In 16 healthy adult subjects, administration of daptomycin 6 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 5 days, with coadministration of a single oral dose of warfarin (25 mg) on the 5th day, had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug and did not significantly alter the INR (International Normalized Ratio). Simvastatin In 20 healthy adult subjects on a stable daily dose of simvastatin 40 mg, administration of daptomycin 4 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 14 days (N=10) had no effect on plasma trough concentrations of simvastatin and was not associated with a higher incidence of adverse events, including skeletal myopathy, than in subjects receiving placebo once daily (N=10) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid (500 mg 4 times daily) and a single dose of daptomycin 4 mg/kg by IV infusion over a 30-minute period in adults did not significantly alter the C max or AUC 0 to \u221e of daptomycin. 12.4 Microbiology Daptomycin belongs to the cyclic lipopeptide class of antibacterials. Daptomycin has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of daptomycin encompasses most clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro. This has been demonstrated both by time-kill curves and by MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. Daptomycin maintained bactericidal activity in vitro against stationary phase S. aureus in simulated endocardial vegetations. The clinical significance of this is not known. Mechanism of Action Daptomycin binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death. Resistance The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is not fully understood. Currently, there are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to daptomycin. Interactions with Other Antibacterials In vitro studies have investigated daptomycin interactions with other antibacterials. Antagonism, as determined by kill curve studies, has not been observed. In vitro synergistic interactions of daptomycin with aminoglycosides, \u03b2-lactam antibacterials, and rifampin have been shown against some isolates of staphylococci (including some methicillin-resistant isolates) and enterococci (including some vancomycin-resistant isolates). Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI in adult patients. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received daptomycin at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial. S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis and Other Post-Approval Trials in Adults In subsequent clinical trials in adult patients, non-susceptible isolates were recovered. S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a compassionate-use trial and from 7 patients in the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . An E. faecium was isolated from a patient in a vancomycin-resistant enterococci trial. Antimicrobial Activity Daptomycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )]. Gram-Positive Bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant isolates) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis Streptococcus pyogenes The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for daptomycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of daptomycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Each 100 mL amber vial of Cisplatin Injection contains: 1 mg/mL cisplatin USP, 9 mg/mL sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide to adjust pH, and water for injection to a final volume of 50 mL and 100 mL respectively. The pH range of Cisplatin Injection is 3.8 to 5.9. Cisplatin Injection must be further diluted prior to administration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , All Patients ). The active ingredient, cisplatin USP, is a yellow to orange crystalline powder. Cisplatin is a heavy metal complex containing a central atom of platinum surrounded by two chloride atoms and two ammonia molecules in the cis position. It is soluble in water or saline at 1 mg/mL and in dimethylformamide at 24 mg/mL. It has a melting point of 207\u00b0C. PtCl 2 H 6 N 2 M.W. 300.05 Cispaltinimage01"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Plasma concentrations of the parent compound, cisplatin, decay monoexponentially with a half-life of about 20 to 30 minutes following bolus administrations of 50 or 100 mg/m 2 doses. Monoexponential decay and plasma half-lives of about 0.5 hour are also seen following 2-hour or 7-hour infusions of 100 mg/m 2 . After the latter, the total-body clearances and volumes of distribution at steady-state for cisplatin are about 15 to 16 L/h/m 2 and 11 to 12 L/m 2 . Due to its unique chemical structure, the chlorine atoms of cisplatin are more subject to chemical displacement reactions by nucleophiles, such as water or sulfhydryl groups, than to enzyme-catalyzed metabolism. At physiological pH in the presence of 0.1M NaCl, the predominant molecular species are cisplatin and monohydroxymonochloro cis -diammine platinum (II) in nearly equal concentrations. The latter, combined with the possible direct displacement of the chlorine atoms by sulfhydryl groups of amino acids or proteins, accounts for the instability of cisplatin in biological matrices. The ratios of cisplatin to total free (ultrafilterable) platinum in the plasma vary considerably between patients and range from 0.5 to 1.1 after a dose of 100 mg/m 2 . Cisplatin does not undergo the instantaneous and reversible binding to plasma proteins that is characteristic of normal drug-protein binding. However, the platinum from cisplatin, but not cisplatin itself, becomes bound to several plasma proteins, including albumin, transferrin, and gamma globulin. Three hours after a bolus injection and two hours after the end of a three-hour infusion, 90% of the plasma platinum is protein bound. The complexes between albumin and the platinum from cisplatin do not dissociate to a significant extent and are slowly eliminated with a minimum half-life of five days or more. Following cisplatin doses of 20 to 120 mg/m 2 , the concentrations of platinum are highest in liver, prostate, and kidney; somewhat lower in bladder, muscle, testicle, pancreas, and spleen; and lowest in bowel, adrenal, heart, lung, cerebrum, and cerebellum. Platinum is present in tissues for as long as 180 days after the last administration. With the exception of intracerebral tumors, platinum concentrations in tumors are generally somewhat lower than the concentrations in the organ where the tumor is located. Different metastatic sites in the same patient may have different platinum concentrations. Hepatic metastases have the highest platinum concentrations, but these are similar to the platinum concentrations in normal liver. Maximum red blood cell concentrations of platinum are reached within 90 to 150 minutes after a 100 mg/m 2 dose of cisplatin and decline in a biphasic manner with a terminal half-life of 36 to 47 days. Over a dose range of 40 to 140 mg cisplatin/m 2 given as a bolus injection or as infusions varying in length from 1 hour to 24 hours, from 10% to about 40% of the administered platinum is excreted in the urine in 24 hours. Over five days following administration of 40 to 100 mg/m 2 doses given as rapid, 2- to 3-hour, or 6- to 8-hour infusions, a mean of 35% to 51% of the dosed platinum is excreted in the urine. Similar mean urinary recoveries of platinum of about 14% to 30% of the dose are found following five daily administrations of 20, 30, or 40 mg/m 2 /day. Only a small percentage of the administered platinum is excreted beyond 24 hours post-infusion and most of the platinum excreted in the urine in 24 hours is excreted within the first few hours. Platinum-containing species excreted in the urine are the same as those found following the incubation of cisplatin with urine from healthy subjects, except that the proportions are different. The parent compound, cisplatin, is excreted in the urine and accounts for 13% to 17% of the dose excreted within one hour after administration of 50 mg/m 2 . The mean renal clearance of cisplatin exceeds creatinine clearance and is 62 and 50 mL/min/m 2 following administration of 100 mg/m 2 as 2-hour or 6- to 7-hour infusions, respectively. The renal clearance of free (ultrafilterable) platinum also exceeds the glomerular filtration rate indicating that cisplatin or other platinum-containing molecules are actively secreted by the kidneys. The renal clearance of free platinum is nonlinear and variable and is dependent on dose, urine flow rate, and individual variability in the extent of active secretion and possible tubular reabsorption. There is a potential for accumulation of ultrafilterable platinum plasma concentrations whenever cisplatin is administered on a daily basis but not when dosed on an intermittent basis. No significant relationships exist between the renal clearance of either free platinum or cisplatin and creatinine clearance.

These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, exocrine glands and, to a limited degree, in the autonomic ganglia. Thus, it diminishes the volume and free acidity of gastric secretions and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal, and bronchial secretions. Glycopyrrolate antagonizes muscarinic symptoms (e.g., bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, and intestinal hypermotility) induced by cholinergic drugs such as the anticholinesterases. The highly polar quaternary ammonium group of glycopyrrolate limits its passage across lipid membranes, such as the blood-brain barrier, in contrast to atropine sulfate and scopolamine hydrobromide, which are highly non-polar tertiary amines which penetrate lipid barriers easily. With intravenous injection, the onset of action is generally evident within one minute. Following intramuscular administration, the onset of action is noted in 15 to 30 minutes, with peak effects occurring within approximately 30 to 45 minutes. The vagal blocking effects persist for 2 to 3 hours and the antisialagogue effects persist up to 7 hours, periods longer than for atropine. Pharmacokinetics The following pharmacokinetic information and conclusions were obtained from published studies that used nonspecific assay methods.

EXCRETION The mean clearance and mean T 1/2 values were reported to be 0.54\u00b10.14 L/kg/hr and 0.83\u00b10.13 hr, respectively post IV administration. After IV administration of a 0.2 mg radiolabeled glycopyrrolate, 85% of dose recovered was recovered in urine 48 hours postdose and some of the radioactivity was also recovered in bile. After IM administration of glycopyrrolate to adults, the mean T 1/2 value is reported to be between 0.55 to 1.25 hrs.

In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment.

The protein binding of acetylcysteine ranges from 66 to 87%. Elimination Metabolism Acetylcysteine (i.e., N-acetylcysteine) is postulated to form cysteine and disulfides (N-N-diacetylcysteine and N-acetylcysteine). Cysteine is further metabolized to form glutathione and other metabolites. Excretion After a single oral dose of [ 35 S]-acetylcysteine 100 mg, between 13 to 38% of the total radioactivity administered was recovered in urine within 24 hours. In a separate study, renal clearance was estimated to be approximately 30% of total body clearance.

The prothrombin test is sensitive to the levels of three of these four factors\u2212II, VII, and X. Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for a microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the post-translational carboxylation of multiple, specific, peptide-bound glutamic acid residues in inactive hepatic precursors of factors II, VII, IX, and X. The resulting gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residues convert the precursors into active coagulation factors that are subsequently secreted by liver cells into the blood. Phytonadione is readily absorbed following intramuscular administration. After absorption, phytonadione is initially concentrated in the liver, but the concentration declines rapidly. Very little vitamin K accumulates in tissues. Little is known about the metabolic fate of vitamin K. Almost no free unmetabolized vitamin K appears in bile or urine. In normal animals and humans, phytonadione is virtually devoid of pharmacodynamic activity. However, in animals and humans deficient in vitamin K, the pharmacological action of vitamin K is related to its normal physiological function, that is, to promote the hepatic biosynthesis of vitamin K dependent clotting factors. The action of the aqueous dispersion, when administered intravenously, is generally detectable within an hour or two and hemorrhage is usually controlled within 3 to 6 hours.

However, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics relationship for cefepime has not been evaluated in patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters for cefepime in healthy adult male volunteers (n=9) following single 30-minute infusions (IV) of cefepime 500 mg, 1 g, and 2 g are summarized in Table 7 . Elimination of cefepime is principally via renal excretion with an average (\u00b1SD) half-life of 2 (\u00b10.3) hours and total body clearance of 120 (\u00b18) mL/min in healthy volunteers. Cefepime pharmacokinetics are linear over the range 250 mg to 2 g. There is no evidence of accumulation in healthy adult male volunteers (n=7) receiving clinically relevant doses for a period of 9 days.

Distribution The average steady-state volume of distribution of cefepime is 18 (\u00b12) L. The serum protein binding of cefepime is approximately 20% and is independent of its concentration in serum. Concentrations of cefepime achieved in specific tissues and body fluids are listed in Table 9 . Table 9: Mean Concentrations of Cefepime in Specific Body Fluids (mcg/mL) or Tissues (mcg/g) Tissue or Fluid Dose/Route # of Patients Mean Time of Sample Post-Dose (h) Mean Concentration Blister Fluid 2 g IV 6 1.5 81.4 mcg/mL Bronchial Mucosa 2 g IV 20 4.8 24.1 mcg/g Sputum 2 g IV 5 4 7.4 mcg/mL Urine 500 mg IV 8 0 to 4 292 mcg/mL 1 g IV 12 0 to 4 926 mcg/mL 2 g IV 12 0 to 4 3120 mcg/mL Bile 2 g IV 26 9.4 17.8 mcg/mL Peritoneal Fluid 2 g IV 19 4.4 18.3 mcg/mL Appendix 2 g IV 31 5.7 5.2 mcg/g Gallbladder 2 g IV 38 8.9 11.9 mcg/g Prostate 2 g IV 5 1 31.5 mcg/g Data suggest that cefepime does cross the inflamed blood-brain barrier. The clinical relevance of these data is uncertain at this time. Metabolism and Excretion Cefepime is metabolized to N-methylpyrrolidine (NMP) which is rapidly converted to the N-oxide (NMP-N-oxide). Urinary recovery of unchanged cefepime accounts for approximately 85% of the administered dose. Less than 1% of the administered dose is recovered from urine as NMP, 6.8% as NMP-N-oxide, and 2.5% as an epimer of cefepime. Because renal excretion is a significant pathway of elimination, patients with renal dysfunction and patients undergoing hemodialysis require dosage adjustment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Specific Populations Patients with Renal impairment Cefepime pharmacokinetics have been investigated in patients with various degrees of renal impairment (n=30). The average half-life in patients requiring hemodialysis was 13.5 (\u00b12.7) hours and in patients requiring continuous peritoneal dialysis was 19 (\u00b12) hours. Cefepime total body clearance decreased proportionally with creatinine clearance in patients with abnormal renal function, which serves as the basis for dosage adjustment recommendations in this group of patients [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Patients with Hepatic impairment The pharmacokinetics of cefepime were unaltered in patients with hepatic impairment who received a single 1 g dose (n=11). Geriatric patients Cefepime pharmacokinetics have been investigated in elderly (65 years of age and older) men (n=12) and women (n=12) whose mean (SD) creatinine clearance was 74 (\u00b115) mL/min. There appeared to be a decrease in cefepime total body clearance as a function of creatinine clearance. Therefore, dosage administration of cefepime in the elderly should be adjusted as appropriate if the patient\u2019s creatinine clearance is 60 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Pediatric patients Cefepime pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in pediatric patients from 2 months to 11 years of age following single and multiple doses on every 8 hours (n=29) and every 12 hours (n=13) schedules. Following a single intravenous dose, total body clearance and the steady-state volume of distribution averaged 3.3 (\u00b11) mL/min/kg and 0.3 (\u00b10.1) L/kg, respectively. The urinary recovery of unchanged cefepime was 60.4 (\u00b130.4)% of the administered dose, and the average renal clearance was 2 (\u00b11.1) mL/min/kg. There were no significant effects of age or gender (25 male vs. 17 female) on total body clearance or volume of distribution, corrected for body weight. No accumulation was seen when cefepime was given at 50 mg per kg every 12 hours (n=13), while C max , AUC, and t \u00bd were increased about 15% at steady state after 50 mg per kg every 8 hours. The exposure to cefepime following a 50 mg per kg intravenous dose in a pediatric patient is comparable to that in an adult treated with a 2 g intravenous dose. The absolute bioavailability of cefepime after an intramuscular dose of 50 mg per kg was 82.3 (\u00b115)% in eight patients. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Cefepime is a bactericidal drug that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cefepime has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity that encompasses a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Within bacterial cells, the molecular targets of cefepime are the penicillin binding proteins (PBP). Antimicrobial Activity Cefepime has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the Indications and Usage section ( 1 ). Gram-negative Bacteria Enterobacter spp. Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Gram-positive Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for cefepime against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of cefepime in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive Bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus saprophyticus Streptococcus agalactiae NOTE: Most isolates of enterococci, e.g., Enterococcus faecalis , and methicillin-resistant staphylococci are resistant to cefepime. Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subsp. lwoffii Citrobacter diversus Citrobacter freundii Enterobacter agglomerans Haemophilus influenzae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Proteus vulgaris Providencia rettgeri Providencia stuartii Serratia marcescens NOTE: Cefepime is inactive against many isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

Amphotericin B liposome for injection may also contain hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide as pH adjusters. Following reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection, the resulting pH of the suspension is between 5.0 to 6.0. Amphotericin B liposome for injection is a true single bilayer liposomal drug delivery system. Liposomes are closed, spherical vesicles created by mixing specific proportions of amphophilic substances such as phospholipids and cholesterol so that they arrange themselves into multiple concentric bilayer membranes when hydrated in aqueous solutions. Single bilayer liposomes are then formed by microemulsification of multilamellar vesicles using a homogenizer. Amphotericin B liposome for injection consists of these unilamellar bilayer liposomes with amphotericin B intercalated within the membrane. Due to the nature and quantity of amphophilic substances used, and the lipophilic moiety in the amphotericin B molecule, the drug is an integral part of the overall structure of the Amphotericin B liposomes. Amphotericin B liposome for injection contains true liposomes that are less than 100 nm in diameter. A schematic depiction of the liposome is presented below. Note: Liposomal encapsulation or incorporation into a lipid complex can substantially affect a drug\u2019s functional properties relative to those of the unencapsulated drug or non-lipid associated drug. In addition, different liposomal or lipid-complex products with a common active ingredient may vary from one another in the chemical composition and physical form of the lipid component. Such differences may affect the functional properties of these drug products. Amphotericin B is a macrocyclic, polyene, antifungal antibiotic produced from a strain of Streptomyces nodosus .

Tobramycin sulfate is O -3-amino-3-deoxy- \u03b1 -D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21924)- O -[2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy- \u03b1 -D- ribo -hexopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine, sulfate (2:5) (salt) and has the chemical formula (C 18 H 37 N 5 O 9 ) 2 \u2022 5H 2 SO 4 . The molecular weight is 1,425.39. The structural formula for tobramycin is as follows: A pharmacy bulk package is a container of a sterile preparation for parenteral use that contains many single doses. The contents are intended for use in a pharmacy admixture service and are restricted to the preparation of admixtures for intravenous infusion (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Directions for proper use of Pharmacy Bulk Package ). tobramycin-spl-structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tobramycin is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular administration. Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin sulfate is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultra filtration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin sulfate is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Interactions with Other Antibiotics: Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis . However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g., Enterococcus faecium . Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized. Cross-Resistance: Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter sp Enterobacter sp Escherichia coli Klebsiella sp Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia sp Serratia sp Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci.

Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose may aid in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a protein-sparing action. Dextrose injected parenterally undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide and water. Intravenous solutions containing potassium chloride are particularly intended to provide needed potassium cation (K + ). Potassium is the chief cation of body cells (160 mEq/liter of intracellular water). It is found in low concentration in plasma and extracellular fluids (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter in a healthy adult). Potassium plays an important role in electrolyte balance. Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium-free diet, potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion. A deficiency of either potassium, or chloride will lead to a deficit of the other. Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics are linear over the approved recommended dose range. Distribution The volume of distribution of cyclophosphamide is 30 to 50 L. Cyclophosphamide is approximately 20% protein bound, with no dose dependent changes. Some metabolites are greater than 60% protein bound. Elimination The elimination half-life (t\u00bd) of cyclophosphamide ranges from 3 to 12 hours, and clearance (CL) ranges from 4 to 5.6 L/h. When cyclophosphamide was administered at 4 g/m 2 (approximately 2 times the approved recommended dosage) over a 90-minute infusion, concentration-time data demonstrate saturable elimination in parallel with first-order renal elimination. Metabolism Cyclophosphamide is metabolized by cytochrome P450s including CYP2A6, 2B6, 3A, 2C9, and 2C19. Cyclophosphamide is activated to form 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, which is in equilibrium with its ring-open tautomer aldophosphamide. 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and aldophosphamide can undergo oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenases to form the inactive metabolites 4-ketocyclophosphamide and carboxyphosphamide, respectively. Aldophosphamide can undergo \u03b2-elimination to form active metabolites phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. This spontaneous conversion can be catalyzed by albumin and other proteins. At high doses, the fraction of parent compound cleared by 4-hydroxylation is reduced resulting in non-linear elimination of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide appears to induce its own metabolism. This auto-induction results in an increase in CL, increased formation of active 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and shortened t\u00bd following multiple doses administered at 12-to 24-hour interval. Excretion Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites are eliminated by hepatic and renal pathways. Cyclophosphamide is primarily excreted as metabolites. Ten to 20% is excreted unchanged in the urine. A small percentage of cyclophosphamide may be eliminated unchanged in bile. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Following one-hour intravenous infusion, cyclophosphamide AUC increased by 38% in patients with CLcr of 25 to 50 mL/min, by 77% in patients with CLcr of 10 to 24 mL/min and by 23% in the hemodialysis group (CLcr of < 10 mL/min) compared to the control group (CLcr\u2265 80 mL/min). Cyclophosphamide is dialyzable. Dialysis clearance averaged 104 mL/min, which is similar to the metabolic clearance of 95 mL/min for cyclophosphamide. A mean of 37% of the administered dose of cyclophosphamide was removed during a 4-hour hemodialysis period. The t\u00bd was 3.3 hours in patients during hemodialysis, a 49% reduction compared to t\u00bd of 6.5 hours in uremic patients. Hepatic Impairment Cyclophosphamide CL is decreased by 40% (45 \u00b1 8.6 L/kg) and t\u00bd is prolonged by 64% (12.5 \u00b1 1 hours) in patients with hepatic impairment with a mean bilirubin 3.5 mg/dL and mean AST 90 IU/L compared to patients with normal hepatic function (mean bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, mean AST 10 IU/L)."], "manufacturer_name": ["XGen Pharmaceuticals DJB, Inc."], "substance_name": ["CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE"], "effective_time": "20241220", "product_ndc": ["39822-0250", "39822-0255", "39822-0260"], "brand_name": ["CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE"]}

This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the (H + , K + )-ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours for all doses tested (20 mg to 120 mg). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Antisecretory Activity The magnitude and time course for inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated acid output (PSAO) by single doses (20 to 120 mg) of pantoprazole sodium for injection were assessed in a single-dose, open-label, placebo-controlled, dose-response study. The results of this study are shown in Table 4. Healthy subjects received a continuous infusion for 25 hours of pentagastrin (PG) at 1 mcg/kg/h, a dose known to produce submaximal gastric acid secretion. The placebo group showed a sustained, continuous acid output for 25 hours, validating the reliability of the testing model.

In one study of gastric pH in healthy subjects, pantoprazole was administered orally (40 mg enteric coated tablets) or pantoprazole sodium for injection (40 mg) once daily for 5 days and pH was measured for 24 hours following the fifth dose. The outcome measure was median percent of time that pH was \u22654 and the results were similar for intravenous and oral medications; however, the clinical significance of this parameter is unknown. Serum Gastrin Effects Serum gastrin concentrations were assessed in two placebo-controlled studies. In a 5-day study of oral pantoprazole with 40 and 60 mg doses in healthy subjects, following the last dose on day 5, median 24-hour serum gastrin concentrations were elevated by 3- to 4-fold compared to placebo in both 40 and 60 mg dose groups. However, by 24 hours following the last dose, median serum gastrin concentrations for both groups returned to normal levels. In another placebo-controlled, 7-day study of 40 mg intravenous or oral pantoprazole in patients with GERD and a history of EE, the mean serum gastrin concentration increased approximately 50% from baseline and as compared with placebo, but remained within the normal range. During 6 days of repeated administration of pantoprazole sodium for injection in patients with ZE Syndrome, consistent changes of serum gastrin concentrations from baseline were not observed. Enterochromaffin-Like (ECL) Cell Effects There are no data available on the effects of intravenous pantoprazole sodium on ECL cells. In a nonclinical study in Sprague-Dawley rats, lifetime exposure (24 months) to oral pantoprazole at doses of 0.5 to 200 mg/kg/day resulted in dose-related increases in gastric ECL-cell proliferation and gastric neuroendocrine (NE)-cell tumors. Gastric NE-cell tumors in rats may result from chronic elevation of serum gastrin concentrations. The high density of ECL cells in the rat stomach makes this species highly susceptible to the proliferative effects of elevated gastrin concentrations produced by PPIs. However, there were no observed elevations in serum gastrin following the administration of oral pantoprazole at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day. In a separate study, a gastric NE-cell tumor without concomitant ECL-cell proliferative changes was observed in 1 female rat following 12 months of dosing with oral pantoprazole at 5 mg/kg/day and a 9 month off-dose recovery [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Endocrine Effects In a clinical pharmacology study, pantoprazole 40 mg given orally once daily for 2 weeks had no effect on the levels of the following hormones: cortisol, testosterone, triiodothyronine (T 3 ), thyroxine (T 4 ), thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyronine-binding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin, aldosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin and growth hormone. In a 1-year study of GERD patients treated with pantoprazole 40 mg or 20 mg, there were no changes from baseline in overall levels of T 3 , T 4 , and TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pantoprazole peak serum concentration (C max ) and area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) increase in a manner proportional to intravenous doses from 10 mg to 80 mg. Pantoprazole does not accumulate and its pharmacokinetics are unaltered with multiple daily dosing. Following the administration of pantoprazole sodium for injection, the serum concentration of pantoprazole declines biexponentially with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately one hour. In CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ] with normal liver function receiving a 40 mg dose of pantoprazole sodium for injection by constant rate over 15 minutes, the peak concentration (C max ) is 5.52 \u00b11.42 mcg/mL and the total area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) is 5.4 \u00b11.5 mcg hr/mL. The total clearance is 7.6 to 14 L/h. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of pantoprazole is approximately 11 to 23.6 L, distributing mainly in extracellular fluid. The serum protein binding of pantoprazole is about 98%, primarily to albumin. Elimination Metabolism Pantoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Pantoprazole metabolism is independent of the route of administration (intravenous or oral). The main metabolic pathway is demethylation, by CYP2C19, with subsequent sulfation; other metabolic pathways include oxidation by CYP3A4. There is no evidence that any of the pantoprazole metabolites have significant pharmacologic activity. CYP2C19 displays a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some sub-populations (e.g., 3% of Whites and African-Americans and 17 to 23% of Asians). Although these sub-populations of slow pantoprazole metabolizers have elimination half-life values from 3.5 to 10 hours, they still have minimal accumulation (23% or less) with once daily dosing. Excretion After administration of a single intravenous dose of 14C-labeled pantoprazole sodium to healthy, extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers, approximately 71% of the dose was excreted in the urine with 18% excreted in the feces through biliary excretion. There was no renal excretion of unchanged pantoprazole. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients After repeated intravenous administration in elderly subjects (65 to 76 years of age), the AUC and elimination half-life values of pantoprazole were similar to those observed in younger subjects. Male and Female Patients After oral administration there was a modest increase in the AUC and C max of pantoprazole in women compared to men. However, weight-normalized clearance values are similar in women and men. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment, pharmacokinetic parameters for pantoprazole were similar to those of healthy subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A to C), maximum pantoprazole concentrations increased only slightly (1.5-fold) relative to healthy subjects when pantoprazole sodium was administered orally. Although serum half-life values increased to 7 to 9 hours and AUC values increased by 5- to 7-fold in hepatic-impaired patients, these increases were no greater than those observed in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, where no dosage adjustment is warranted. These pharmacokinetic changes in hepatic-impaired patients result in minimal drug accumulation following once daily, multiple-dose administration. Oral pantoprazole doses higher than 40 mg per day have not been studied in hepatically impaired patients. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on Pantoprazole Pantoprazole is metabolized mainly by CYP2C19 and to minor extents by CYPs 3A4, 2D6 and 2C9. In in vivo drug-drug interaction studies with CYP2C19 substrates (diazepam [also a CYP3A4 substrate] and phenytoin [also a CYP3A4 inducer]), nifedipine, midazolam, and clarithromycin (CYP3A4 substrates), metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate), diclofenac, naproxen and piroxicam (CYP2C9 substrates) and theophylline (a CYP1A2 substrate) in healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole were not significantly altered. Effect of Pantoprazole on Other Drugs Clopidogrel Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. In a crossover clinical study, 66 healthy subjects were administered clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg per day) alone and with oral pantoprazole (80 mg at the same time as clopidogrel) for 5 days. On Day 5, the mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 14% (geometric mean ratio was 86%, with 90% CI of 79 to 93%) when pantoprazole sodium was coadministered with clopidogrel as compared to clopidogrel administered alone. Pharmacodynamic parameters were also measured and demonstrated that the change in inhibition of platelet aggregation (induced by 5 micromolar ADP) was correlated with the change in the exposure to clopidogrel active metabolite. The clinical significance of this finding is not clear. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) Administration of oral pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily for 4 days and a single 1000 mg dose of MMF approximately one hour after the last dose of pantoprazole to 12 healthy subjects in a cross-over study resulted in a 57% reduction in the C max and 27% reduction in the AUC of MPA. Transplant patients receiving approximately 2000 mg per day of MMF (n=12) were compared to transplant patients receiving approximately the same dose of MMF and oral pantoprazole 40 mg per day (n=21). There was a 78% reduction in the C max and a 45% reduction in the AUC of MPA in patients receiving both pantoprazole and MMF [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Other Drugs In vivo studies also suggest that pantoprazole does not significantly affect the kinetics of other drugs (theophylline, diazepam [and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam], phenytoin, metoprolol, nifedipine, carbamazepine, midazolam, clarithromycin, diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam and oral contraceptives [levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol]). In other in vivo studies, digoxin, ethanol, glyburide, antipyrine, caffeine, metronidazole, and amoxicillin had no clinically relevant interactions with pantoprazole. Although no significant drug-drug interactions have been observed in clinical studies, the potential for significant drug-drug interactions with more than once daily dosing with high doses of pantoprazole has not been studied in poor metabolizers or individuals who are hepatically impaired. Antacids There was also no interaction with concomitantly administered antacids. Pediatric use information is approved for Pfizer Inc.'s PROTONIX\u00ae I.V. (pantoprazole sodium) for Injection. However, due to Pfizer Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C19 displays a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some subpopulations (e.g., approximately 3% of Whites and African-Americans and 17% to 23% of Asians are poor metabolizers). Although these subpopulations of pantoprazole poor metabolizers have elimination half-life values of 3.5 to 10 hours in adults, they still have minimal accumulation (23% or less) with once daily dosing. For adult patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, no dosage adjustment is needed. Similar to adults, pediatric patients who have the poor metabolizer genotype of CYP2C19 (CYP2C19 *2/*2) exhibited greater than a 6-fold increase in AUC compared to pediatric extensive (CYP2C19 *1/*1) and intermediate (CYP2C19 *1/*x) metabolizers. Poor metabolizers exhibited approximately 10-fold lower apparent oral clearance compared to extensive metabolizers."], "manufacturer_name": ["Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited"], "substance_name": ["PANTOPRAZOLE SODIUM"], "effective_time": "20250407", "product_ndc": ["46708-071"], "brand_name": ["PANTOPRAZOLE SODIUM"]}

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism The pharmacokinetic properties (PK) of fluconazole are similar following administration by the intravenous or oral routes. In normal volunteers, the bioavailability of orally administered fluconazole is over 90% compared with intravenous administration. Bioequivalence was established between the 100 mg tablet and both suspension strengths when administered as a single 200 mg dose. Peak plasma concentrations (C max ) in fasted normal volunteers occur between 1 and 2 hours with a terminal plasma elimination half-life of approximately 30 hours (range: 20 to 50 hours) after oral administration. In fasted normal volunteers, administration of a single oral 400 mg dose of fluconazole leads to a mean C max of 6.72 mcg/mL (range: 4.12 to 8.08 mcg/mL) and after single or multiple oral doses of 50 to 400 mg, fluconazole plasma concentrations and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) are dose proportional ( Table 1 ).

Administration of a loading dose (on Day 1) of twice the usual daily dose results in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day. The apparent volume of distribution of fluconazole approximates that of total body water. Plasma protein binding is low (11 to 12%). Following either single- or multiple oral doses for up to 14 days, fluconazole penetrates into all body fluids studied (see table below). In normal volunteers, saliva concentrations of fluconazole were equal to or slightly greater than plasma concentrations regardless of dose, route, or duration of dosing. In patients with bronchiectasis, sputum concentrations of fluconazole following a single 150 mg oral dose were equal to plasma concentrations at both 4 and 24 hours post dose. In patients with fungal meningitis, fluconazole concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are approximately 80% of the corresponding plasma concentrations. A single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 27 patients penetrated into vaginal tissue, resulting in tissue: plasma ratios ranging from 0.94 to 1.14 over the first 48 hours following dosing. A single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 14 patients penetrated into vaginal fluid, resulting in fluid: plasma ratios ranging from 0.36 to 0.71 over the first 72 hours following dosing.

In normal volunteers, fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion, with approximately 80% of the administered dose appearing in the urine as unchanged drug. About 11% of the dose is excreted in the urine as metabolites. The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are markedly affected by reduction in renal function. There is an inverse relationship between the elimination half-life and creatinine clearance. The dose of fluconazole may need to be reduced in patients with impaired renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) A 3-hour hemodialysis session decreases plasma concentrations by approximately 50%. In normal volunteers, fluconazole administration (doses ranging from 200 mg to 400 mg once daily for up to 14 days) was associated with small and inconsistent effects on testosterone concentrations, endogenous corticosteroid concentrations, and the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated cortisol response. Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients In pediatrics patients from 2 days to 15 years of age, the following pharmacokinetic data have been reported following the administration of fluconazole: Table 3: Pharmacokinetic Parameters* of Fluconazole in Pediatric Patients Following the Administration of Fluconazole *Data for Clearance, C max, AUC and V dss are presented as arithmetic mean (CV%) and Half-life as arithmetic mean only. *AUC 0-in f; ^AUC 0-24 ; Abbreviations :C max =Peak plasma concentrations, AUC =area under the plasma concentration time curve; and V dss =volume of distribution at steady state.

Similarly, the half-life was 73.6 hours, which decreased with time to a mean of 53.2 hours 6 days later and 46.6 hours 12 days later. In a study of 13 pediatric patients (preterm and term infants with median gestational age (GA) of 37 weeks, GA range 24 to 39 weeks; median postnatal age [PNA] 19 days, PNA range 5 to 262 days) 12 infants received a 25 mg/kg loading dose, and 9/12 (75%) achieved an AUC0-24 of >400-mg*h/L in the first 24 hours. A population pharmacokinetic model using data from 55 pediatric patients (GA 23 to 40 weeks, PNA 1 to 88 days) found that a loading dose of 25 mg/kg is necessary to reach target AUC >400-mg*h/L within 24 hours of initiating therapy in pediatric patients younger than 3 months of age. A maintenance dose of 9 mg/kg daily should be used in pediatric patients born at GA less than 30 weeks and 12 mg/kg daily in pediatric patients with GA equal or greater than 30 weeks. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) A population PK model using data from 21 pediatric patients ages from birth to 17 years supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and 19 pediatric non-ECMO patients ages from birth to 2 years found that clearance was related to serum creatinine while a higher volume of distribution was related to presence of ECMO support. The median volume of distribution was 1.3 L/kg in pediatric patients on ECMO and 0.9 L/kg in those not on ECMO. Simulations suggested that a loading dose of 35 mg/kg is needed to achieve the target AUC 0-24 >400 mg*h/L within the first 24 hours in pediatric patients on ECMO. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Pharmacokinetics in Elderly A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 22 subjects, 65 years of age or older receiving a single 50 mg oral dose of fluconazole. Ten of these patients were concomitantly receiving diuretics. The C max was 1.54 mcg/mL and occurred at 1.3 hours post dose. The mean AUC was 76.4 \u00b1 20.3 mcg\u2022h/mL, and the mean terminal half-life was 46.2 hours. These pharmacokinetic parameter values are higher than analogous values reported for normal young male volunteers. Coadministration of diuretics did not significantly alter the AUC or C max . In addition, creatinine clearance (74 mL/min), the percent of drug recovered unchanged in urine (0 to 24 hours, 22%), and the fluconazole renal clearance estimates (0.124 mL/min/kg) for the elderly were generally lower than those of younger volunteers. Thus, the alteration of fluconazole disposition in the elderly appears to be related to reduced renal function characteristic of this group. A plot of each subject's terminal elimination half-life versus creatinine clearance compared to the predicted half-life \u2013 creatinine clearance curve derived from normal subjects and subjects with varying degrees of renal insufficiency indicated that 21 of 22 subjects fell within the 95% confidence limit of the predicted half-life \u2013 creatinine clearance curves. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that higher values for the pharmacokinetic parameters observed in the elderly subjects compared to normal young male volunteers are due to the decreased kidney function that is expected in the elderly. Drug Interaction Studies (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ) Oral contraceptives: Oral contraceptives were administered as a single dose both before and after the oral administration of fluconazole 50 mg once daily for 10 days in 10 healthy women. There was no significant difference in ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel AUC after the administration of 50 mg of fluconazole. The mean increase in ethinyl estradiol AUC was 6% (range: \u201347 to 108%) and levonorgestrel AUC increased 17% (range: \u201333 to 141%). In a second study, twenty-five normal females received daily doses of both 200 mg fluconazole tablets or placebo for two, ten-day periods. The treatment cycles were one month apart with all subjects receiving fluconazole during one cycle and placebo during the other. The order of study treatment was random. Single doses of an oral contraceptive tablet containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol were administered on the final treatment day (Day 10) of both cycles. Following administration of 200 mg of fluconazole, the mean percentage increase of AUC for levonorgestrel compared to placebo was 25% (range: -12 to 82%) and the mean percentage increase for ethinyl estradiol compared to placebo was 38% (range: -11 to 101%). Both of these increases were statistically significantly different from placebo. A third study evaluated the potential interaction of once-weekly dosing of fluconazole 300 mg to 21 normal females taking an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone. In this placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover study carried out over three cycles of oral contraceptive treatment, fluconazole dosing resulted in small increases in the mean AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone compared to similar placebo dosing. The mean AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone increased by 24% (95% C.I. range: 18 to 31%) and 13% (95% C.I. range: 8 to 18%), respectively, relative to placebo. Fluconazole treatment did not cause a decrease in the ethinyl estradiol AUC of any individual subject in this study compared to placebo dosing. The individual AUC values of norethindrone decreased very slightly (<5%) in 3 of the 21 subjects after fluconazole treatment. Cimetidine: Fluconazole 100 mg was administered as a single oral dose alone and two hours after a single dose of cimetidine 400 mg to six healthy male volunteers. After the administration of cimetidine, there was a significant decrease in fluconazole AUC and C max . There was a mean \u00b1 SD decrease in fluconazole AUC of 13% \u00b1 11% (range: \u20133.4 to \u201331%) and C max decreased 19% \u00b1 14% (range: \u20135 to \u201340%). However, the administration of cimetidine 600 mg to 900 mg intravenously over a four-hour period (from one hour before to 3 hours after a single oral dose of fluconazole 200 mg) did not affect the bioavailability or pharmacokinetics of fluconazole in 24 healthy male volunteers. Antacid: Administration of Maalox \u00ae (20 mL) to 14 normal male volunteers immediately prior to a single dose of fluconazole 100 mg had no effect on the absorption or elimination of fluconazole. Hydrochlorothiazide: Concomitant oral administration of 100 mg fluconazole and 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide for 10 days in 13 normal volunteers resulted in a significant increase in fluconazole AUC and C max compared to fluconazole given alone. There was a mean \u00b1 SD increase in fluconazole AUC and C max of 45% \u00b1 31% (range: 19 to 114%) and 43% \u00b1 31% (range: 19 to 122%), respectively. These changes are attributed to a mean \u00b1 SD reduction in renal clearance of 30% \u00b1 12% (range: \u201310 to \u201350%). Rifampin: Administration of a single oral 200 mg dose of fluconazole after 15 days of rifampin administered as 600 mg daily in eight healthy male volunteers resulted in a significant decrease in fluconazole AUC and a significant increase in apparent oral clearance of fluconazole. There was a mean \u00b1 SD reduction in fluconazole AUC of 23% \u00b1 9% (range: \u201313 to \u201342%). Apparent oral clearance of fluconazole increased 32% \u00b1 17% (range: 16 to 72%). Fluconazole half-life decreased from 33.4 \u00b1 4.4 hours to 26.8 \u00b1 3.9 hours. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Warfarin: There was a significant increase in prothrombin time response (area under the prothrombin time-time curve) following a single dose of warfarin (15 mg) administered to 13 normal male volunteers following oral fluconazole 200 mg administered daily for 14 days as compared to the administration of warfarin alone. There was a mean \u00b1 SD increase in the prothrombin time response (area under the prothrombin time-time curve) of 7% \u00b1 4% (range: \u20132 to 13%). (See PRECAUTIONS .) Mean is based on data from 12 subjects as one of 13 subjects experienced a 2-fold increase in his prothrombin time response. Phenytoin: Phenytoin AUC was determined after 4 days of phenytoin dosing (200 mg daily, orally for 3 days followed by 250 mg intravenously for one dose) both with and without the administration of fluconazole (oral fluconazole 200 mg daily for 16 days) in 10 normal male volunteers. There was a significant increase in phenytoin AUC. The mean \u00b1 SD increase in phenytoin AUC was 88% \u00b1 68% (range: 16 to 247%). The absolute magnitude of this interaction is unknown because of the intrinsically nonlinear disposition of phenytoin. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Cyclosporine: Cyclosporine AUC and C max were determined before and after the administration of fluconazole 200 mg daily for 14 days in eight renal transplant patients who had been on cyclosporine therapy for at least 6 months and on a stable cyclosporine dose for at least 6 weeks. There was a significant increase in cyclosporine AUC, C max , C min (24-hour concentration), and a significant reduction in apparent oral clearance following the administration of fluconazole. The mean \u00b1 SD increase in AUC was 92% \u00b1 43% (range: 18 to 147%). The C max increased 60% \u00b1 48% (range: \u20135 to 133%). The C min increased 157% \u00b1 96% (range: 33 to 360%). The apparent oral clearance decreased 45% \u00b1 15% (range: \u201315 to \u201360%). (See PRECAUTIONS .) Zidovudine: Plasma zidovudine concentrations were determined on two occasions (before and following fluconazole 200 mg daily for 15 days) in 13 volunteers with AIDS or ARC who were on a stable zidovudine dose for at least two weeks. There was a significant increase in zidovudine AUC following the administration of fluconazole. The mean \u00b1 SD increase in AUC was 20% \u00b1 32% (range: \u201327 to 104%). The metabolite, GZDV, to parent drug ratio significantly decreased after the administration of fluconazole, from 7.6 \u00b1 3.6 to 5.7 \u00b1 2.2. Theophylline: The pharmacokinetics of theophylline were determined from a single intravenous dose of aminophylline (6 mg/kg) before and after the oral administration of fluconazole 200 mg daily for 14 days in 16 normal male volunteers. There were significant increases in theophylline AUC, C max , and half-life with a corresponding decrease in clearance. The mean \u00b1 SD theophylline AUC increased 21% \u00b1 16% (range: \u20135 to 48%). The C max increased 13% \u00b1 17% (range: \u201313 to 40%). Theophylline clearance decreased 16% \u00b1 11% (range: \u201332 to 5%). The half-life of theophylline increased from 6.6 \u00b1 1.7 hours to 7.9 \u00b1 1.5 hours. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Quinidine: Although not studied in vitro or in vivo , concomitant administration of fluconazole with quinidine may result in inhibition of quinidine metabolism. Use of quinidine has been associated with QT prolongation and rare occurrences of torsade de pointes. Coadministration of fluconazole and quinidine is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS .) Oral hypoglycemics: The effects of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of the sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents tolbutamide, glipizide, and glyburide were evaluated in three placebo-controlled studies in normal volunteers. All subjects received the sulfonylurea alone as a single dose and again as a single dose following the administration of fluconazole 100 mg daily for 7 days. In these three studies, 22/46 (47.8%) of fluconazole-treated patients and 9/22 (40.1%) of placebo-treated patients experienced symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Tolbutamide: In 13 normal male volunteers, there was significant increase in tolbutamide (500 mg single dose) AUC and C max following the administration of fluconazole. There was a mean \u00b1 SD increase in tolbutamide AUC of 26% \u00b1 9% (range: 12 to 39%). Tolbutamide C max increased 11% \u00b1 9% (range: \u20136 to 27%). (See PRECAUTIONS .) Glipizide: The AUC and C max of glipizide (2.5 mg single dose) were significantly increased following the administration of fluconazole in 13 normal male volunteers. There was a mean \u00b1 SD increase in AUC of 49% \u00b1 13% (range: 27 to 73%) and an increase in C max of 19% \u00b1 23% (range: \u201311 to 79%). (See PRECAUTIONS .) Glyburide: The AUC and C max of glyburide (5 mg single dose) were significantly increased following the administration of fluconazole in 20 normal male volunteers. There was a mean \u00b1 SD increase in AUC of 44% \u00b1 29% (range: \u201313 to 115%) and C max increased 19% \u00b1 19% (range: \u201323 to 62%). Five subjects required oral glucose following the ingestion of glyburide after 7 days of fluconazole administration. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Rifabutin: There have been published reports that an interaction exists when fluconazole is administered concomitantly with rifabutin, leading to increased serum levels of rifabutin. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Tacrolimus: There have been published reports that an interaction exists when fluconazole is administered concomitantly with tacrolimus, leading to increased serum levels of tacrolimus. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Midazolam: The effect of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam was examined in a randomized, cross-over study in 12 volunteers. In the study, subjects ingested placebo or 400 mg fluconazole on Day 1 followed by 200 mg daily from Day 2 to Day 6. In addition, a 7.5 mg dose of midazolam was orally ingested on the first day, 0.05 mg/kg was administered intravenously on the fourth day, and 7.5 mg orally on the sixth day. Fluconazole reduced the clearance of intravenous midazolam by 51%. On the first day of dosing, fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and C max by 259% and 150%, respectively. On the sixth day of dosing, fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and C max by 259% and 74%, respectively. The psychomotor effects of midazolam were significantly increased after oral administration of midazolam but not significantly affected following intravenous midazolam. A second randomized, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, cross over study in three phases was performed to determine the effect of route of administration of fluconazole on the interaction between fluconazole and midazolam. In each phase the subjects were given oral fluconazole 400 mg and intravenous saline; oral placebo and intravenous fluconazole 400 mg; and oral placebo and intravenous saline. An oral dose of 7.5 mg of midazolam was ingested after fluconazole/placebo. The AUC and C max of midazolam were significantly higher after oral than intravenous administration of fluconazole. Oral fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and C max by 272% and 129%, respectively. Intravenous fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and C max by 244% and 79%, respectively. Both oral and intravenous fluconazole increased the pharmacodynamic effects of midazolam. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Azithromycin: An open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study in 18 healthy subjects assessed the effect of a single 800 mg oral dose of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of a single 1200 mg oral dose of azithromycin as well as the effects of azithromycin on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole. There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between fluconazole and azithromycin. Voriconazole: Voriconazole is a substrate for both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes. Concurrent administration of oral Voriconazole (400 mg Q12h for 1 day, then 200 mg Q12h for 2.5 days) and oral fluconazole (400 mg on Day 1, then 200 mg Q24h for 4 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in an increase in C max and AUC\u03c4 of voriconazole by an average of 57% (90% CI: 20% to 107%) and 79% (90% CI: 40% to 128%), respectively. In a follow-on clinical study involving 8 healthy male subjects, reduced dosing and/or frequency of voriconazole and fluconazole did not eliminate or diminish this effect. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Tofacitinib: Coadministration of fluconazole (400 mg on Day 1 and 200 mg once daily for 6 days [Days 2 to 7]) and tofacitinib (30 mg single dose on Day 5) in healthy subjects resulted in increased mean tofacitinib AUC and C max values of approximately 79% (90% CI: 64% to 96%) and 27% (90% CI: 12% to 44%), respectively, compared to administration of tofacitinib alone. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Abrocitinib: When coadministered with fluconazole (inhibitor of CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4), the systemic exposure (AUC) of abrocitinib was approximately 4.8-fold higher and the combined exposure (AUC) of abrocitinib and its active metabolites was approximately 2.5-fold higher compared to when abrocitinib was administered alone.

These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, exocrine glands and, to a limited degree, in the autonomic ganglia. Thus, it diminishes the volume and free acidity of gastric secretions and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal, and bronchial secretions. Glycopyrrolate antagonizes muscarinic symptoms (e.g., bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, and intestinal hypermotility) induced by cholinergic drugs such as the anticholinesterases. The highly polar quaternary ammonium group of glycopyrrolate limits its passage across lipid membranes, such as the blood-brain barrier, in contrast to atropine sulfate and scopolamine hydrobromide, which are highly non-polar tertiary amines which penetrate lipid barriers easily. With intravenous injection, the onset of action is generally evident within one minute. Following intramuscular administration, the onset of action is noted in 15 to 30 minutes, with peak effects occurring within approximately 30 to 45 minutes. The vagal blocking effects persist for 2 to 3 hours and the antisialagogue effects persist up to 7 hours, periods longer than for atropine. Pharmacokinetics The following pharmacokinetic information and conclusions were obtained from published studies that used nonspecific assay methods. DISTRIBUTION The mean volume of distribution of glycopyrrolate was estimated to be 0.42\u00b10.22 L/kg. METABOLISM The in vivo metabolism of glycopyrrolate in humans has not been studied. EXCRETION The mean clearance and mean T 1/2 values were reported to be 0.54\u00b10.14 L/kg/hr and 0.83\u00b10.13 hr, respectively post IV administration. After IV administration of a 0.2 mg radiolabeled glycopyrrolate, 85% of dose recovered was recovered in urine 48 hours postdose and some of the radioactivity was also recovered in bile. After IM administration of glycopyrrolate to adults, the mean T 1/2 value is reported to be between 0.55 to 1.25 hrs. Over 80% of IM dose administered was recovered in urine and the bile as unchanged drug and half the IM dose is excreted within 3 hrs.

Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination. The plasma half-life is dose-dependent and it ranges from 0.5 to 2 h.

{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE Before instituting treatment with ceftriaxone, appropriate specimens should be obtained for isolation of the causative organism and for determination of its susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ceftriaxone for injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, ceftriaxone for injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Ceftriaxone for injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms: Lower Respiratory Tract Infections Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis or Serratia marcescens . Acute Bacterial Otitis Media Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains) or Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains). NOTE: In one study lower clinical cure rates were observed with a single dose of ceftriaxone compared to 10 days of oral therapy. In a second study comparable cure rates were observed between single dose ceftriaxone and the comparator. The potentially lower clinical cure rate of ceftriaxone should be balanced against the potential advantages of parenteral therapy (see CLINICAL STUDIES ).

Urinary Tract Infections (complicated and uncomplicated) Caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii or Klebsiella pneumoniae . Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral and rectal) Caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae , including both penicillinase- and nonpenicillinase-producing strains, and pharyngeal gonorrhea caused by nonpenicillinase-producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Ceftriaxone sodium, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis . Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added. Bacterial Septicemia Caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae or Klebsiella pneumoniae . Bone and Joint Infections Caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Enterobacter species. Intra-abdominal Infections Caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium species (Note: most strains of Clostridium difficile are resistant) or Peptostreptococcus species. Meningitis Caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae .

Sampling times were from 1 to 50 hours after a single intramuscular injection of 50 mg/kg of ceftriaxone. Mean (\u00b1SD) ceftriaxone levels in the middle ear reached a peak of 35 (\u00b112) mcg/mL at 24 hours, and remained at 19 (\u00b17) mcg/mL at 48 hours. Based on middle ear fluid ceftriaxone concentrations in the 23 to 25 hour and the 46 to 50 hour sampling time intervals, a half-life of 25 hours was calculated. Ceftriaxone is highly bound to plasma proteins. The extent of binding to proteins in the middle ear fluid is unknown. Interaction with Calcium Two in vitro studies, one using adult plasma and the other neonatal plasma from umbilical cord blood have been carried out to assess interaction of ceftriaxone and calcium. Ceftriaxone concentrations up to 1 mM (in excess of concentrations achieved in vivo following administration of 2 grams ceftriaxone infused over 30 minutes) were used in combination with calcium concentrations up to 12 mM (48 mg/dL). Recovery of ceftriaxone from plasma was reduced with calcium concentrations of 6 mM (24 mg/dL) or higher in adult plasma or 4 mM (16 mg/dL) or higher in neonatal plasma. This may be reflective of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitation. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Ceftriaxone is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Ceftriaxone has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Grampositive bacteria. Mechanism of Resistance Resistance to ceftriaxone is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Pemetrexed is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor that disrupts folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. In vitro studies show that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is taken into cells by membrane carriers such as the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pemetrexed inhibited the in vitro growth of mesothelioma cell lines (MSTO-211H, NCI-H2052) and showed synergistic effects when combined with cisplatin. Based on population pharmacodynamic analyses, the depth of the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) nadir correlates with the systemic exposure to pemetrexed and supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B 12 . There is no cumulative effect of pemetrexed exposure on ANC nadir over multiple treatment cycles. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed when pemetrexed for injection was administered as a single agent in doses ranging from 0.2 to 838 mg/m 2 infused over a 10-minute period have been evaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumors. Pemetrexed total systemic exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C max ) increased proportionally with increase of dose. The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed did not change over multiple treatment cycles. Distribution Pemetrexed has a steady-state volume of distribution of 16.1 liters. In vitro studies indicated that pemetrexed is 81% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination The total systemic clearance of pemetrexed is 91.8 mL/min and the elimination half-life of pemetrexed is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90 mL/min). As renal function decreases, the clearance of pemetrexed decreases and exposure (AUC) of pemetrexed increases. Metabolism Pemetrexed is not metabolized to an appreciable extent. Excretion Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70% to 90% of the dose recovered unchanged within the first 24 hours following administration. In vitro studies indicated that pemetrexed is a substrate of OAT3 (organic anion transporter 3), a transporter that is involved in the active secretion of pemetrexed. Specific Populations Age (26 to 80 years) and sex had no clinically meaningful effect on the systemic exposure of pemetrexed based on population pharmacokinetic analyses. Racial Groups The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed were similar in Whites and Blacks or African Americans. Insufficient data are available for other ethnic groups. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Pemetrexed has not been formally studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No effect of elevated AST, ALT, or total bilirubin on the PK of pemetrexed was observed in clinical studies. Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic analyses of pemetrexed included 127 patients with impaired renal function. Plasma clearance of pemetrexed decreases as renal function decreases, with a resultant increase in systemic exposure. Patients with creatinine clearances of 45, 50, and 80 mL/min had 65%, 54%, and 13% increases, respectively in systemic exposure (AUC) compared to patients with creatinine clearance of 100 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Third-Space Fluid The pemetrexed plasma concentrations in patients with various solid tumors with stable, mild to moderate third-space fluid were comparable to those observed in patients without third space fluid collections. The effect of severe third space fluid on pharmacokinetics is not known. Drug Interaction Studies Drugs Inhibiting OAT3 Transporter Ibuprofen, an OAT3 inhibitor, administered at 400 mg four times a day decreased the clearance of pemetrexed and increased its exposure (AUC) by approximately 20% in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance >80 mL/min). In Vitro Studies Pemetrexed is a substrate for OAT3. Ibuprofen, an OAT3 inhibitor inhibited the uptake of pemetrexed in OAT3-expressing cell cultures with an average [I u ]/IC 50 ratio of 0.38. In vitro data predict that at clinically relevant concentrations, other NSAIDs (naproxen, diclofenac, celecoxib) would not inhibit the uptake of pemetrexed by OAT3 and would not increase the AUC of pemetrexed to a clinically significant extent. [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Pemetrexed is a substrate for OAT4. In vitro, ibuprofen and other NSAIDs (naproxen, diclofenac, celecoxib) are not inhibitors of OAT4 at clinically relevant concentrations. Aspirin Aspirin, administered in low to moderate doses (325 mg every 6 hours), does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. Cisplatin Cisplatin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed and the pharmacokinetics of total platinum are unaltered by pemetrexed. Vitamins Neither folic acid nor vitamin B 12 affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed.

The drop is caused by slower absorption, as compared to oral administration, because of the poor water solubility of phenytoin. Intravenous administration is the preferred route for producing rapid therapeutic serum levels. Patients stabilized on a daily oral regimen of phenytoin experience a drop in peak blood levels to 50 to 60 percent of stable levels if crossed over to an equal dose administered intramuscularly. However, the intramuscular depot of poorly soluble material is eventually absorbed, as determined by urinary excretion of 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), the principal metabolite, as well as the total amount of drug eventually appearing in the blood. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. A short-term (one week) study indicates that patients do not experience the expected drop in blood levels when crossed over to the intramuscular route if the phenytoin IM dose is increased by 50 percent over the previously established oral dose. To avoid drug accumulation caused by absorption from the muscle depots, it is recommended that for the first week back on oral phenytoin, the dose be reduced to half of the original oral dose (one-third of the IM dose). Experience for periods greater than one week is lacking and blood level monitoring is recommended. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs most often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Elimination The serum half-life in man after intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. S e x /Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. P regnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11 ). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2-3% in the White population, 0.5-4% in the Asian population, and <1 % in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15-36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc."], "substance_name": ["PHENYTOIN SODIUM"], "effective_time": "20240409", "product_ndc": ["0641-0493", "0641-2555"], "brand_name": ["Phenytoin Sodium"]}
{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE In the treatment of both tuberculosis and the meningococcal carrier state, the small number of resistant cells present within large populations of susceptible cells can rapidly become the predominant type. Bacteriologic cultures should be obtained before the start of therapy to confirm the susceptibility of the organism to rifampin and they should be repeated throughout therapy to monitor the response to treatment. Since resistance can emerge rapidly, susceptibility tests should be performed in the event of persistent positive cultures during the course of treatment. If test results show resistance to rifampin and the patient is not responding to therapy, the drug regimen should be modified. Tuberculosis Rifampin is indicated in the treatment of all forms of tuberculosis. A three-drug regimen consisting of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide is recommended in the initial phase of short-course therapy which is usually continued for 2 months. The Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, the American Thoracic Society, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that either streptomycin or ethambutol be added as a fourth drug in a regimen containing isoniazid (INH), rifampin, and pyrazinamide for initial treatment of tuberculosis unless the likelihood of INH resistance is very low. The need for a fourth drug should be reassessed when the results of susceptibility testing are known. If community rates of INH resistance are currently less than 4%, an initial treatment regimen with less than four drugs may be considered. Following the initial phase, treatment should be continued with rifampin and isoniazid for at least 4 months. Treatment should be continued for longer if the patient is still sputum or culture positive, if resistant organisms are present, or if the patient is HIV positive. RIFADIN IV is indicated for the initial treatment and retreatment of tuberculosis when the drug cannot be taken by mouth. Meningococcal Carriers Rifampin is indicated for the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. Rifampin is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection because of the possibility of the rapid emergence of resistant organisms. (See WARNINGS .) Rifampin should not be used indiscriminately, and, therefore, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed for establishment of the carrier state and the correct treatment. So that the usefulness of rifampin in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers is preserved, the drug should be used only when the risk of meningococcal disease is high. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of rifampin and other antibacterial drugs, rifampin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."], "generic_name": ["RIFAMPIN"], "id": "73a70d16-e9be-48b7-99d1-57ea074ddb9b", "route": ["INTRAVENOUS"], "description": ["DESCRIPTION RIFADIN (rifampin capsules USP) for oral administration contains 150 mg or 300 mg rifampin per capsule.

RIFADIN IV (rifampin for injection USP) contains rifampin 600 mg, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate 10 mg, and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH. Rifampin is a semisynthetic antibiotic derivative of rifamycin SV. Rifampin is a red-brown crystalline powder very slightly soluble in water at neutral pH, freely soluble in chloroform, soluble in ethyl acetate and in methanol. Its molecular weight is 822.95 and its chemical formula is C 43 H 58 N 4 O 12 .

Its structural formula is: Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oral Administration Rifampin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak serum concentrations in healthy adults and pediatric populations vary widely from individual to individual. Following a single 600 mg oral dose of rifampin in healthy adults, the peak serum concentration averages 7 mcg/mL but may vary from 4 to 32 mcg/mL. Absorption of rifampin is reduced by about 30% when the drug is ingested with food. Rifampin is widely distributed throughout the body. It is present in effective concentrations in many organs and body fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid. Rifampin is about 80% protein bound. Most of the unbound fraction is not ionized and, therefore, diffuses freely into tissues. In healthy adults, the mean biological half-life of rifampin in serum averages 3.35\u00b10.66 hours after a 600 mg oral dose, with increases up to 5.08\u00b12.45 hours reported after a 900 mg dose. With repeated administration, the half-life decreases and reaches average values of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The half-life does not differ in patients with renal failure at doses not exceeding 600 mg daily, and, consequently, no dosage adjustment is required. The half-life of rifampin at a dose of 720 mg daily has not been established in patients with renal failure. Following a single 900 mg oral dose of rifampin in patients with varying degrees of renal insufficiency, the mean half-life increased from 3.6 hours in healthy adults to 5.0, 7.3, and 11.0 hours in patients with glomerular filtration rates of 30 to 50 mL/min, less than 30 mL/min, and in anuric patients, respectively. Refer to the WARNINGS section for information regarding patients with hepatic insufficiency. After absorption, rifampin is rapidly eliminated in the bile, and an enterohepatic circulation ensues. During this process, rifampin undergoes progressive deacetylation so that nearly all the drug in the bile is in this form in about 6 hours. This metabolite has antibacterial activity. Intestinal reabsorption is reduced by deacetylation, and elimination is facilitated. Up to 30% of a dose is excreted in the urine, with about half of this being unchanged drug. Intravenous Administration After intravenous administration of a 300 or 600 mg dose of rifampin infused over 30 minutes to healthy male volunteers (n=12), mean peak plasma concentrations were 9.0\u00b13.0 and 17.5\u00b15.0 mcg/mL, respectively. Total body clearances after the 300 and 600 mg IV doses were 0.19\u00b10.06 and 0.14\u00b10.03 L/hr/kg, respectively. Volumes of distribution at steady state were 0.66\u00b10.14 and 0.64\u00b10.11 L/kg for the 300 and 600 mg IV doses, respectively. After intravenous administration of 300 or 600 mg doses, rifampin plasma concentrations in these volunteers remained detectable for 8 and 12 hours, respectively (see Table ).

After repeated once-a-day infusions (3-hr duration) of 600 mg in patients (n=5) for 7 days, concentrations of IV rifampin decreased from 5.81\u00b13.38 mcg/mL 8 hours after the infusion on day 1 to 2.6\u00b11.88 mcg/mL 8 hours after the infusion on day 7. Rifampin is widely distributed throughout the body. It is present in effective concentrations in many organs and body fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid. Rifampin is about 80% protein bound. Most of the unbound fraction is not ionized and therefore diffuses freely into tissues. Rifampin is rapidly eliminated in the bile and undergoes progressive enterohepatic circulation and deacetylation to the primary metabolite, 25\u2011desacetyl-rifampin. This metabolite is microbiologically active. Less than 30% of the dose is excreted in the urine as rifampin or metabolites. Serum concentrations do not differ in patients with renal failure at a studied dose of 300 mg, and consequently, no dosage adjustment is required. Pediatrics Oral Administration In one study, pediatric patients 6 to 58 months old were given rifampin suspended in simple syrup or as dry powder mixed with applesauce at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight. Peak serum concentrations of 10.7\u00b13.7 and 11.5\u00b15.1 mcg/mL were obtained 1 hour after preprandial ingestion of the drug suspension and the applesauce mixture, respectively. After the administration of either preparation, the t \u00bd of rifampin averaged 2.9 hours. It should be noted that in other studies in pediatric populations, at doses of 10 mg/kg body weight, mean peak serum concentrations of 3.5 mcg/mL to 15 mcg/mL have been reported. Intravenous Administration In pediatric patients 0.25 to 12.8 years old (n=12), the mean peak serum concentration of rifampin at the end of a 30-minute infusion of approximately 300 mg/m 2 was 25.9\u00b11.3 mcg/mL; individual peak concentrations 1 to 4 days after initiation of therapy ranged from 11.7 to 41.5 mcg/mL; individual peak concentrations 5 to 14 days after initiation of therapy were 13.6 to 37.4 mcg/mL. The individual serum half-life of rifampin changed from 1.04 to 3.81 hours early in therapy to 1.17 to 3.19 hours 5 to 14 days after therapy was initiated. In a pharmacokinetics (PK) study of 22 pediatric patients (median gestational age 27.5 weeks [range; 23\u201341 weeks] and median postnatal age (PNA) 7.5 days [range: 0\u201356 days]) receiving intravenous rifampin 10\u201320 mg/kg/day over 30 minutes, pediatric patients \u22647 days old had a median clearance of 0.09 L/kg/hr (range: 0.056\u20130.14 L/kg/hr) and a median area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve at infinity (AUC\u221e) of 105 mg*hr/L (range: 80172 mg*hr/L); pediatric patients >7 days PNA had a median clearance of 0.23 L/kg/hr (range: 0.14\u20130.32 L/kg/hr) and a median AUC\u221e of 78 mg*hr/L (range: 51\u2013170 mg*hr/L). Based on PK modeling and simulation analyses, a dose of 12 mg/kg infused over 60 minutes once daily in pediatric patients \u22647 days PNA resulted in median (90% prediction interval) for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 8.4 mcg/mL (range: 5.3 \u2013 13.3 mcg/mL) and AUC\u221e of 96.4 mg*hr/L (range: 64.5 \u2013 141.6 mg*hr/L); in pediatric patients >7 days and < 90 days PNA a dose of 14 mg/kg infused over 60 minutes once daily resulted in a median (90% prediction interval) for Cmax of 9.6 mcg/mL (range: 6.l \u2013 15.1 mcg/mL) and AUC\u221e of 73.l mg*hr/L (range: 45.6 \u2013 131.6 mg*hr/L). All simulated AUC\u221e were within the range of AUC\u221e values reported in other studies in adults treated for tuberculosis. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Rifampin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. Specifically, it interacts with bacterial RNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme. Resistance Organisms resistant to rifampin are likely to be resistant to other rifamycins. In the treatment of both tuberculosis and the meningococcal carrier state (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ), the small number of resistant cells present within large populations of susceptible cells can rapidly become predominant. In addition, resistance to rifampin has been determined to occur as single-step mutations of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Since resistance can emerge rapidly, appropriate susceptibility tests should be performed in the event of persistent positive cultures. Activity in vitro and in vivo Rifampin has bactericidal activity in vitro against slow and intermittently growing M. tuberculosis organisms. Rifampin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ): Aerobic Gram-Negative Microorganisms: Neisseria meningitidis \"Other\" Microorganisms: Mycobacterium tuberculosis The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown . At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for rifampin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of rifampin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Aerobic Gram-Positive Microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus /MRSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis Aerobic Gram-Negative Microorganisms: Haemophilus influenzae \"Other\" Microorganisms: Mycobacterium leprae \u03b2-lactamase production should have no effect on rifampin activity.

The pH range of Cisplatin Injection is 3.8 to 5.9. Cisplatin Injection must be further diluted prior to administration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , All Patients ). The active ingredient, cisplatin USP, is a yellow to orange crystalline powder. Cisplatin is a heavy metal complex containing a central atom of platinum surrounded by two chloride atoms and two ammonia molecules in the cis position.

Monoexponential decay and plasma half-lives of about 0.5 hour are also seen following 2-hour or 7-hour infusions of 100 mg/m 2 . After the latter, the total-body clearances and volumes of distribution at steady-state for cisplatin are about 15 to 16 L/h/m 2 and 11 to 12 L/m 2 . Due to its unique chemical structure, the chlorine atoms of cisplatin are more subject to chemical displacement reactions by nucleophiles, such as water or sulfhydryl groups, than to enzyme-catalyzed metabolism. At physiological pH in the presence of 0.1M NaCl, the predominant molecular species are cisplatin and monohydroxymonochloro cis -diammine platinum (II) in nearly equal concentrations. The latter, combined with the possible direct displacement of the chlorine atoms by sulfhydryl groups of amino acids or proteins, accounts for the instability of cisplatin in biological matrices. The ratios of cisplatin to total free (ultrafilterable) platinum in the plasma vary considerably between patients and range from 0.5 to 1.1 after a dose of 100 mg/m 2 . Cisplatin does not undergo the instantaneous and reversible binding to plasma proteins that is characteristic of normal drug-protein binding. However, the platinum from cisplatin, but not cisplatin itself, becomes bound to several plasma proteins, including albumin, transferrin, and gamma globulin. Three hours after a bolus injection and two hours after the end of a three-hour infusion, 90% of the plasma platinum is protein bound. The complexes between albumin and the platinum from cisplatin do not dissociate to a significant extent and are slowly eliminated with a minimum half-life of five days or more. Following cisplatin doses of 20 to 120 mg/m 2 , the concentrations of platinum are highest in liver, prostate, and kidney; somewhat lower in bladder, muscle, testicle, pancreas, and spleen; and lowest in bowel, adrenal, heart, lung, cerebrum, and cerebellum. Platinum is present in tissues for as long as 180 days after the last administration. With the exception of intracerebral tumors, platinum concentrations in tumors are generally somewhat lower than the concentrations in the organ where the tumor is located. Different metastatic sites in the same patient may have different platinum concentrations. Hepatic metastases have the highest platinum concentrations, but these are similar to the platinum concentrations in normal liver. Maximum red blood cell concentrations of platinum are reached within 90 to 150 minutes after a 100 mg/m 2 dose of cisplatin and decline in a biphasic manner with a terminal half-life of 36 to 47 days. Over a dose range of 40 to 140 mg cisplatin/m 2 given as a bolus injection or as infusions varying in length from 1 hour to 24 hours, from 10% to about 40% of the administered platinum is excreted in the urine in 24 hours. Over five days following administration of 40 to 100 mg/m 2 doses given as rapid, 2- to 3-hour, or 6- to 8-hour infusions, a mean of 35% to 51% of the dosed platinum is excreted in the urine. Similar mean urinary recoveries of platinum of about 14% to 30% of the dose are found following five daily administrations of 20, 30, or 40 mg/m 2 /day. Only a small percentage of the administered platinum is excreted beyond 24 hours post-infusion and most of the platinum excreted in the urine in 24 hours is excreted within the first few hours. Platinum-containing species excreted in the urine are the same as those found following the incubation of cisplatin with urine from healthy subjects, except that the proportions are different. The parent compound, cisplatin, is excreted in the urine and accounts for 13% to 17% of the dose excreted within one hour after administration of 50 mg/m 2 . The mean renal clearance of cisplatin exceeds creatinine clearance and is 62 and 50 mL/min/m 2 following administration of 100 mg/m 2 as 2-hour or 6- to 7-hour infusions, respectively. The renal clearance of free (ultrafilterable) platinum also exceeds the glomerular filtration rate indicating that cisplatin or other platinum-containing molecules are actively secreted by the kidneys. The renal clearance of free platinum is nonlinear and variable and is dependent on dose, urine flow rate, and individual variability in the extent of active secretion and possible tubular reabsorption. There is a potential for accumulation of ultrafilterable platinum plasma concentrations whenever cisplatin is administered on a daily basis but not when dosed on an intermittent basis. No significant relationships exist between the renal clearance of either free platinum or cisplatin and creatinine clearance.

Nelarabine is demethylated by adenosine deaminase (ADA) to ara-G, mono-phosphorylated by deoxyguanosine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase, and subsequently converted to the active 5\u2019-triphosphate, ara-GTP. Accumulation of ara-GTP in leukemic blasts allows for incorporation into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death. Other mechanisms may contribute to the cytotoxic and systemic toxicity of nelarabine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption : Following intravenous administration of nelarabine to adult patients with refractory leukemia or lymphoma, plasma ara-G C max values generally occurred at the end of the nelarabine infusion and were generally higher than nelarabine C max values, suggesting rapid and extensive conversion of nelarabine to ara-G. Mean plasma nelarabine and ara-G C max values were 5.0 \u00b1 3.0 mcg/mL and 31.4 \u00b1 5.6 mcg/mL, respectively, after a 1,500 mg/m 2 nelarabine dose infused over 2 hours in adult patients. The area under the concentration- time curve (AUC) of ara-G is 37 times higher than that for nelarabine on Day 1 after nelarabine IV infusion of 1,500 mg/m 2 dose (162 \u00b1 49 mcg . h/mL versus 4.4 \u00b1 2.2 mcg . h/mL, respectively). Comparable C max and AUC values were obtained for nelarabine between Days 1 and 5 at the nelarabine adult dosage of 1,500 mg/m 2 , indicating that nelarabine does not accumulate after multiple-dosing. There are not enough ara-G data to make a comparison between Day 1 and Day 5. After a nelarabine adult dose of 1,500 mg/m 2 , intracellular C max for ara- GTP appeared within 3 to 25 hours on Day 1. Exposure (AUC) to intracellular ara-GTP was 532 times higher than that for nelarabine and 14 times higher than that for ara-G (2,339 \u00b1 2,628 mcg . h/mL versus 4.4 \u00b1 2.2 mcg . h/mL and 162 \u00b1 49 mcg . h/mL, respectively). Because the intracellular levels of ara-GTP were so prolonged, its elimination half-life could not be accurately estimated. Distribution : Nelarabine and ara-G are extensively distributed throughout the body. For nelarabine, V SS values were 197 \u00b1 216 L/m 2 in adult patients. For ara-G, V SS /F values were 50 \u00b1 24 L/m 2 in adult patients. Nelarabine and ara-G are not substantially bound to human plasma proteins (< 25%) in vitro, and binding is independent of nelarabine or ara-G concentrations up to 600 \u03bcM. Metabolism : The principal route of metabolism for nelarabine is O-demethylation by adenosine deaminase to form ara-G, which undergoes hydrolysis to form guanine. In addition, some nelarabine is hydrolyzed to form methylguanine, which is O-demethylated to form guanine. Guanine is N-deaminated to form xanthine, which is further oxidized to yield uric acid. Excretion : Nelarabine and ara-G are partially eliminated by the kidneys. Mean urinary excretion of nelarabine and ara-G was 6.6 \u00b1 4.7% and 27 \u00b1 15% of the administered dose, respectively, in 28 adult patients over the 24 hours after nelarabine infusion on Day 1. Renal clearance averaged 24 \u00b1 23 L/h for nelarabine and 6.2 \u00b1 5.0 L/h for ara-G in 21 adult patients. Combined Phase I pharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 199 to 2,900 mg/m 2 (n = 66 adult patients) indicate that the mean clearance (CL) of nelarabine is 197 \u00b1 189 L/h/m 2 on Day 1. The apparent clearance of ara-G (CL/F) is 10.5 \u00b1 4.5 L/h/m 2 on Day 1. Nelarabine and ara-G are rapidly eliminated from plasma with a mean half-life of 18 minutes and 3.2 hours, respectively, in adult patients. Pediatrics : No pharmacokinetic data are available in pediatric patients at the once-daily 650 mg/m 2 nelarabine dosage. Combined Phase I pharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 104 to 2,900 mg/m 2 indicate that the mean clearance (CL) of nelarabine is about 30% higher in pediatric patients than in adult patients (259 \u00b1 409 L/h/m 2 versus 197 \u00b1 189 L/h/m 2 , respectively) (n = 66 adults, n = 22 pediatric patients) on Day 1. The apparent clearance of ara-G (CL/F) is comparable between the two groups (10.5 \u00b1 4.5 L/h/m 2 in adult patients and 11.3 \u00b1 4.2 L/h/m 2 in pediatric patients) on Day 1. Nelarabine and ara-G are extensively distributed throughout the body. For nelarabine, V SS values were 213 \u00b1 358 L/m 2 in pediatric patients. For ara-G, V SS /F values were 33 \u00b1 9.3 L/m 2 in pediatric patients. Nelarabine and ara-G are rapidly eliminated from plasma in pediatric patients, with a half-life of 13 minutes and 2 hours, respectively. Effect of Age : Age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine or ara-G in adults. Decreased renal function, which is more common in the elderly, may reduce ara-G clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Effect of Gender : Gender has no effect on nelarabine or ara-G pharmacokinetics. Effect of Race : In general, nelarabine mean clearance and volume of distribution values tend to be higher in whites (n = 63) than in blacks (by about 10%) (n = 15). The opposite is true for ara-G; mean apparent clearance and volume of distribution values tend to be lower in whites than in blacks (by about 15% to 20%). No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these groups. Effect of Renal Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of nelarabine and ara-G have not been specifically studied in renally impaired or hemodialyzed patients. Nelarabine is excreted by the kidney to a small extent (5% to 10% of the administered dose). Ara-G is excreted by the kidney to a greater extent (20% to 30% of the administered nelarabine dose). In the combined Phase I trials, patients were categorized into 3 groups: normal with CLCr greater than 80 mL/min (n = 67), mild with CLCr = 50 to 80 mL/min (n = 15), and moderate with CLCr less than 50 mL/min (n = 3). The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of ara-G was about 15% and 40% lower in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively, than in patients with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed. Effect of Hepatic Impairment : The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine has not been evaluated [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interactions : Cytochrome P450: Nelarabine and ara-G did not significantly inhibit the activities of the human hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 in vitro at concentrations of nelarabine and ara-G up to 100 \u03bcM. Fludarabine: Administration of fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 as a 30-minute infusion 4 hours before a 1,200-mg/m 2 infusion of nelarabine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine, ara-G, or ara-GTP in 12 patients with refractory leukemia. Pentostatin: There is in vitro evidence that pentostatin is a strong inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. Inhibition of adenosine deaminase may result in a reduction in the conversion of the prodrug nelarabine to its active moiety and consequently in a reduction in efficacy of nelarabine and/or change in adverse reaction profile of either drug [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited"], "substance_name": ["NELARABINE"], "effective_time": "20240807", "product_ndc": ["46708-813"], "brand_name": ["NELARABINE"]}
{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE Verapamil Hydrochloride Injection, USP is indicated for the following: \u2022 Rapid conversion to sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, including those associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [W-P-W] and Lown-Ganong- Levine [L-G-L] syndromes). When clinically advisable, appropriate vagal maneuvers (e.g., Valsalva maneuver) should be attempted prior to verapamil hydrochloride administration. \u2022 Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation except when the atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation are associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White (W-P-W) and Lown-Ganong-Levine (L-G-L) syndromes). In controlled studies in the United States, about 60% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia converted to normal sinus rhythm within 10 minutes after intravenous verapamil hydrochloride. Uncontrolled studies reported in the world literature describe a conversion rate of about 80%. About 70% of patients with atrial flutter and/or fibrillation with a faster ventricular rate respond with a decrease in ventricular rate of at least 20%. Conversion of atrial flutter or fibrillation to sinus rhythm is uncommon (about 10%) after verapamil hydrochloride and may reflect the spontaneous conversion rate, since the conversion rate after placebo was similar. Slowing of the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter lasts 30 to 60 minutes after a single injection. Because a small fraction (<1%) of patients treated with verapamil hydrochloride respond with life-threatening adverse responses (rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter/fibrillation, and an accessory bypass tract, marked hypotension, or extreme bradycardia/asystole \u2013 see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ), the initial use of verapamil hydrochloride injection should, if possible, be in a treatment setting with monitoring and resuscitation facilities, including D.C.-cardioversion capability (see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Suggested Treatment of Acute Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions).

The antiarrhythmic effect of verapamil appears to be due to its effect on the slow channel in cells of the cardiac conduction system. The vasodilatory effect of verapamil appears to be due to its effect on blockade of calcium channels as well as \u03b1 receptors. In the isolated rabbit heart, concentrations of verapamil that markedly affect SA nodal fibers or fibers in the upper and middle regions of the AV node have very little effect on fibers in the lower AV node (NH region) and no effect on atrial action potentials or His bundle fibers. Electrical activity in the SA and AV nodes depends, to a large degree, upon calcium influx through the slow channel. By inhibiting this influx, verapamil slows AV conduction and prolongs the effective refractory period within the AV node in a rate-related manner. This effect results in a reduction of the ventricular rate in patients with atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular response. By interrupting reentry at the AV node, verapamil can restore normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT), including PSVT associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Verapamil does not induce peripheral arterial spasm. Verapamil has a local anesthetic action that is 1.6 times that of procaine on an equimolar basis. It is not known whether this action is important at the doses used in man. Verapamil does not alter total serum calcium levels. Hemodynamics: Verapamil reduces afterload and myocardial contractility. The commonly used intravenous doses of 5 to 10 mg verapamil hydrochloride produce transient, usually asymptomatic, reduction in normal systemic arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and contractility; left ventricular filling pressure is slightly increased. In most patients, including those with organic cardiac disease, the negative inotropic action of verapamil is countered by reduction of afterload, and cardiac index is usually not reduced. However, in patients with moderately severe to severe cardiac dysfunction (pulmonary wedge pressure above 20 mm Hg, ejection fraction less than 30%), acute worsening of heart failure may be seen. Peak therapeutic effects occur within 3 to 5 minutes after a bolus injection. Pharmacokinetics: Intravenously administered verapamil hydrochloride has been shown to be rapidly metabolized. Following intravenous infusion in man, verapamil is eliminated bi-exponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (half-life about 4 minutes) and a slower terminal elimination phase (half-life 2 to 5 hours). In healthy men, orally administered verapamil hydrochloride undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, with 12 metabolites having been identified, most in only trace amounts. The major metabolites have been identified as various N- and O-dealkylated products of verapamil. Approximately 70% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and 16% more in the feces within 5 days. About 3% to 4% is excreted as unchanged drug.

Magnesium has a depressant effect on the central nervous system [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics With intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. The estimated magnesium concentration (above baseline) required to elicit half-maximum effect (EC 50 ) on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in pregnant women with preeclampsia that received intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy was reported to be 1.5 and 1.8 mEq per liter (1.9 and 2.2 mg per dL), respectively, in a published study. Effective anticonvulsant serum concentrations range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq per liter. Drug Interaction Studies The following information is based upon published case reports and clinical studies that could not be confirmed by an adequately controlled study, but still warrant consideration given the potential risks involved [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Neuromuscular Blocking Agents: Potentiation and prolongation of neuromuscular blockade requiring modification of the neuromuscular blocking agent dosage and/or increased reversal agent requirements were reported in preeclamptic women who received magnesium sulfate treatment who underwent subsequent surgery (for example, caesarian section) with anesthesia that included either a depolarizing (d-tubocurarine, succinylcholine) or nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent (vecuronium, rocuronium). Narcotics and/or Propofol: Potentiation and prolongation of analgesic and/or sedative effects as well as a reduced requirement for an intravenous narcotic (fentanyl, sufentanil, tramadol), intrathecal narcotic (fentanyl), and/or intravenous propofol was reported in magnesium sulfate treated patients who required surgery or intensive care that also included narcotic and/or propofol therapy.

Activation of the A 2A adenosine receptor by regadenoson produces coronary vasodilation and increases coronary blood flow (CBF). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Coronary Blood Flow Regadenoson causes a rapid increase in CBF which is sustained for a short duration. In patients undergoing coronary catheterization, pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography was used to measure the average peak velocity (APV) of coronary blood flow before and up to 30 minutes after administration of regadenoson (0.4 mg, intravenously). Mean APV increased to greater than twice baseline by 30 seconds and decreased to less than twice the baseline level within 10 minutes [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 .3) ]. Myocardial uptake of the radiopharmaceutical is proportional to CBF. Because regadenoson increases blood flow in normal coronary arteries with little or no increase in stenotic arteries, regadenoson causes relatively less uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in vascular territories supplied by stenotic arteries. MPI intensity after regadenoson administration is therefore greater in areas perfused by normal relative to stenosed arteries. Effect of duration of injection A study in dogs compared the effects of intravenous injection of 2.5 \u00b5g/kg regadenoson (in 10 mL) over 10 seconds and 30 seconds on CBF. The duration of a two-fold increase in CBF was 97\u00b114 seconds (n=6) and 221\u00b120 seconds (n=4), respectively, for the 10 second and 30 second injections. The peak effects (i.e., maximal increase) on CBF after the 10 second and 30 second injections were 217\u00b115% and 297\u00b133% above baseline, respectively. The times to peak effect on CBF were 17\u00b12 seconds and 27\u00b16 seconds, respectively. Effect of Aminophylline Aminophylline (100 mg, administered by slow intravenous injection over 60 seconds) injected 1 minute after 0.4 mg regadenoson in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, was shown to shorten the duration of the coronary blood flow response to regadenoson as measured by pulsed- wave Doppler ultrasonography [see Overdosage ( 10) ]. Effect of Caffeine Ingestion of caffeine decreases the ability to detect reversible ischemic defects. In a placebo- controlled, parallel group clinical study, patients with known or suspected myocardial ischemia received a baseline rest/stress MPI followed by a second stress MPI. Patients received caffeine or placebo 90 minutes before the second regadenoson stress MPI. Following caffeine administration (200 or 400 mg), the mean number of reversible defects identified was reduced by approximately 60%. This decrease was statistically significant [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17) ]. Hemodynamic Effects In clinical studies, the majority of patients had an increase in heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure within 45 minutes after administration of regadenoson. Maximum hemodynamic changes after regadenoson and ADENOSCAN in Studies 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 5.

More patients with regadenoson administration three minutes following inadequate exercise stress had an increase in heart rate and a decrease in systolic blood pressure compared with regadenoson administered at rest. The changes were not associated with any clinically significant adverse reactions. Maximum hemodynamic changes are presented in Table 6.

In in vitro studies, regadenoson has not been shown to have appreciable binding affinity for the A 2B and A 3 adenosine receptors. In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 999 patients with a diagnosis, or risk factors for, coronary artery disease and concurrent asthma or COPD, the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions (dyspnea, wheezing) was greater with regadenoson compared to placebo. Moderate (2.5%) or severe (< 1%) respiratory reactions were observed more frequently in the regadenoson group compared to placebo [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects, the regadenoson plasma concentration-time profile is multi-exponential in nature and best characterized by 3-compartment model. The maximal plasma concentration of regadenoson is achieved within 1 to 4 minutes after injection of regadenoson and parallels the onset of the pharmacodynamic response. The half-life of this initial phase is approximately 2 to 4 minutes. An intermediate phase follows, with a half-life on average of 30 minutes coinciding with loss of the pharmacodynamic effect. The terminal phase consists of a decline in plasma concentration with a half-life of approximately 2 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2) ]. Within the dose range of 0.3\u201320 \u00b5g/kg in healthy subjects, clearance, terminal half-life or volume of distribution do not appear dependent upon the dose. A population pharmacokinetic analysis including data from subjects and patients demonstrated that regadenoson clearance decreases in parallel with a reduction in creatinine clearance and clearance increases with increased body weight. Age, gender, and race have minimal effects on the pharmacokinetics of regadenoson. Specific Populations Renally Impaired Patients: The disposition of regadenoson was studied in 18 patients with various degrees of renal function and in 6 healthy subjects. With increasing renal impairment, from mild (CLcr 50 to < 80 mL/min) to moderate (CLcr 30 to < 50 mL/min) to severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), the fraction of regadenoson excreted unchanged in urine and the renal clearance decreased, resulting in increased elimination half-lives and AUC values compared to healthy subjects (CLcr \u2265 80 mL/min). However, the maximum observed plasma concentrations as well as volumes of distribution estimates were similar across the groups. The plasma concentration- time profiles were not significantly altered in the early stages after dosing when most pharmacologic effects are observed. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. Patients with End Stage Renal Disease: The pharmacokinetics of regadenoson in patients on dialysis has not been assessed; however, in an in vitro study regadenoson was found to be dialyzable. Hepatically Impaired Patients : The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of regadenoson has not been evaluated. Because greater than 55% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and factors that decrease clearance do not affect the plasma concentration in the early stages after dosing when clinically meaningful pharmacologic effects are observed, no dose adjustment is needed in patients with hepatic impairment. Geriatric Patients: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age has a minor influence on the pharmacokinetics of regadenoson. No dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients. Metabolism The metabolism of regadenoson is unknown in humans. Incubation with rat, dog, and human liver microsomes as well as human hepatocytes produced no detectable metabolites of regadenoson. Excretion In healthy volunteers, 57% of the regadenoson dose is excreted unchanged in the urine (range 19- 77%), with an average plasma renal clearance around 450 mL/min, i.e., in excess of the glomerular filtration rate.

Heparin acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system. Small amounts of heparin in combination with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor) can inhibit thrombosis by inactivating activated Factor X and inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Once active thrombosis has developed, larger amounts of heparin can inhibit further coagulation by inactivating thrombin and preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. Clotting time is prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination.

Diastolic pressure falls. Renal blood flow is decreased in normotensive subjects but is increased markedly in shock. Systolic blood pressure may remain unchanged or rise, although mean arterial pressure typically falls. Cardiac output is increased because of the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of the drug in the face of diminished peripheral vascular resistance. Isoproterenol relaxes almost all varieties of smooth muscle when the tone is high, but this action is most pronounced on bronchial and gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It prevents or relieves bronchoconstriction, but tolerance to this effect develops with overuse of the drug. In man, isoproterenol causes less hyperglycemia than does epinephrine. Isoproterenol and epinephrine are equally effective in stimulating the release of free fatty acids and energy production. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Isoproterenol is readily absorbed when given parenterally or as an aerosol.

Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported through the cell membrane by facilitative glucose transporter proteins and is phosphorylated within the cell to [18F] FDG-6- phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase. Once phosphorylated it cannot exit until it is dephosphorylated by glucose-6-phosphatase. Therefore, within a given tissue or pathophysiological process, the retention and clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect a balance involving glucose transporter, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities. When allowance is made for the kinetic differences between glucose and Fludeoxyglucose F 18 transport and phosphorylation (expressed as the \u201clumped constant\u201d ratio), Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is used to assess glucose metabolism. In comparison to background activity of the specific organ or tissue type, regions of decreased or absent uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect the decrease or absence of glucose metabolism. Regions of increased uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect greater than normal rates of glucose metabolism. Pharmacodynamics Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection is rapidly distributed to all organs of the body after intravenous administration. After background clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection, optimal PET imaging is generally achieved between 30 to 40 minutes after administration. In cancer, the cells are generally characterized by enhanced glucose metabolism partially due to (1) an increase in the activity of glucose transporters, (2) an increased rate of phosphorylation activity, (3) a reduction of phosphatase activity or, (4) a dynamic alteration in the balance among all these processes. However, glucose metabolism of cancer as reflected by Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation shows considerable variability. Depending on tumor type, stage, and location, Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation may be increased, normal, or decreased. Also, inflammatory cells can have the same variability of uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18. In the heart, under normal aerobic conditions, the myocardium meets the bulk of its energy requirements by oxidizing free fatty acids. Most of the exogenous glucose taken up by the myocyte is converted into glycogen. However, under ischemic conditions, the oxidation of free fatty acids stimulated, and glucose taken up by the myocyte is metabolized immediately instead of being converted into glycogen. Under these conditions, phosphorylated Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulates in the myocyte and can be detected with PET imaging. Normally, the brain relies on anaerobic metabolism. In epilepsy, the glucose metabolism varies. Generally, during a seizure, glucose metabolism increases. Interictally, the seizure focus tends to be hypometabolic. Pharm a c okinetics In four healthy male volunteers, receiving an intravenous administration of 30 seconds in duration, the arterial blood level profile for Fludeoxyglucose F 18 was described as a triexponential decay curve. The effective half-life ranges of the three phases were 0.2-0.3 minutes, 10-13 minutes with a mean and standard deviation (STD) of 11.6 \u00b1 1.1 min, and 80-95 minutes with a mean and STD of 88 \u00b1\u25a1 4 min. Plasma Protein Binding The extent of binding of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 to plasma proteins is not known. Metabolism Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported into cells and phosphorylated to [ 18 F]-FDG-6-phosphate at a rate proportional to the rate of glucose utilization within that tissue. [ 18 F]-FDG-6-phosphate presumably is metabolized to 2-deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro-6-phospho-D-mannose ([ 18 F]FDM-6-phosphate). Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection may contain several impurities (e.g., 2-deoxy-2-chloro-D-glucose (ClDG)). Biodistribution and metabolism of C1DG are presumed to be similar to Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and would be expected to result in intracellular formation of 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-glucose (C1DG-6-phosphate) and 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-mannose (ClDM-6-phosphate). The phosphorylated deoxyglucose compounds are dephosphorylated and the resulting compounds (FDG, FDM, C1DG, and ClDM) presumably leave cells by passive diffusion. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and related compounds are cleared from non-cardiac tissues within 3 to 24 hours after administration. Clearance from the cardiac tissue may require more than 96 hours. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 that is not involved in glucose metabolism in any tissue is then excreted in the urine. Excretion Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is cleared from most tissues within 24 hours and can be eliminated from the body unchanged in the urine. Three elimination phases have been identified in the reviewed literature. Within 33 minutes, a mean of 3.9% of the administrated radioactive dose was measured in the urine. The amount of radiation exposure of the urinary bladder at two hours post-administration suggests that 20.6% (mean) of the radioactive dose was present in the bladder.

In pediatric patients with epilepsy, doses given have been as low as 2.6 mCi. The pharmacokinetics of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection in renally-impaired patients have not been characterized. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is eliminated through the renal system. Care should be taken to prevent excessive and unnecessary radiation exposure to this organ system and adjacent tissues. The effects of fasting, varying blood sugar levels, conditions of glucose intolerance, and diabetes mellitus on Fludeoxyglucose F 18 distribution in humans have not been ascertained.

As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis, and finally, the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. When this diagnosis is confirmed by peripheral nerve stimulation, it may sometimes be reversed with anticholinesterase drugs such as neostigmine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in seven of seven patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O2/narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery. Anticholinesterase drugs may not always be effective. If given before succinylcholine is metabolized by cholinesterase, anticholinesterase drugs may prolong rather than shorten paralysis. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 and 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and slight increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause slight increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension, and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon in normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold, or cerebration. It should be used only with adequate anesthesia. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. Because it is highly ionized and has low fat solubility, it does not readily cross the placenta. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of ANECTINE in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes, and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including Anectine. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Sandoz Inc"], "substance_name": ["SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20231129", "product_ndc": ["0781-9053"], "brand_name": ["Anectine"]}

Maximal inhibition ranged from 70% to 84% and from 73% to 83% for the 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 dose regimens, respectively. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses, the mean maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib (C max ) after the first dose (Day 1) were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively. When administered twice weekly, the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m 2 dose to patients with multiple myeloma, the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC last ) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The AUC last geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) was 0.99 (0.80 to 1.23). The C max after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/mL) was lower than after intravenous administration (223 ng/mL) with repeat dose administration. Distribution The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 L/m 2 following single- or repeat-dose administration of 1 mg/m 2 or 1.3 mg/m 2 to patients with multiple myeloma. The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively. Metabolism Bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized to several inactive metabolites in vitro via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. Excretion The pathways of elimination of bortezomib have not been characterized in humans. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were observed based on age, sex, or renal impairment (including patients administered bortezomib after dialysis). The effect of race on bortezomib pharmacokinetics is unknown. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following administration of bortezomib doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/m 2 , mild (total bilirubin \u22641x ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment did not alter dose-normalized bortezomib AUC when compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Dose normalized mean bortezomib AUC increased by approximately 60% in patients with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3x ULN and any AST) or severe (total bilirubin >3x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinically significant differences in bortezomib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with dexamethasone (weak CYP3A4 inducer), omeprazole (strong CYP2C19 inhibitor), or melphalan in combination with prednisone. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor Coadministration with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased bortezomib exposure by 35%. Strong CYP3A4 Inducer Coadministration with rifampin (strong CYP3A4 inducer) decreased bortezomib exposure by approximately 45%.

It is a white to off-white amorphous powder, freely soluble in water.

In addition, vasopressin stimulates antidiuresis via stimulation of V 2 receptors which are coupled to adenyl cyclase. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics At therapeutic doses exogenous vasopressin elicits a vasoconstrictive effect in most vascular beds including the splanchnic, renal and cutaneous circulation. In addition, vasopressin at pressor doses triggers contractions of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract mediated by muscular V 1 -receptors and release of prolactin and ACTH via V 3 receptors. At lower concentrations typical for the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin inhibits water diuresis via renal V 2 receptors. In addition, vasopressin has been demonstrated to cause vasodilation in numerous vascular beds that are mediated by V 2 , V 3 , oxytocin and purinergic P2 receptors. In patients with vasodilatory shock vasopressin in therapeutic doses increases systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial blood pressure and reduces the dose requirements for norepinephrine. Vasopressin tends to decrease heart rate and cardiac output. The pressor effect is proportional to the infusion rate of exogenous vasopressin. The pressor effect reaches its peak within 15 minutes. After stopping the infusion the pressor effect fades within 20 minutes. There is no evidence for tachyphylaxis or tolerance to the pressor effect of vasopressin in patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Vasopressin plasma concentrations increase linearly with increasing infusion rates from 10 to 200 \u03bcU/kg/min. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 30 minutes of continuous intravenous infusion. Distribution Vasopressin does not appear to bind plasma protein. The volume of distribution is 140 mL/kg. Elimination At infusion rates used in vasodilatory shock (0.01 to 0.1 units/minute), the clearance of vasopressin is 9 to 25 mL/min/kg in patients with vasodilatory shock. The apparent t 1/2 of vasopressin at these levels is \u2264 10 minutes. Metabolism Serine protease, carboxipeptidase and disulfide oxido-reductase cleave vasopressin at sites relevant for the pharmacological activity of the hormone. Thus, the generated metabolites are not expected to retain important pharmacological activity. Excretion Vasopressin is predominantly metabolized and only about 6% of the dose is excreted unchanged into urine. Specific Populations Pregnancy: Because of a spillover into blood of placental vasopressinase, the clearance of exogenous and endogenous vasopressin increases gradually over the course of a pregnancy. During the first trimester of pregnancy, the clearance is only slightly increased. However, by the third trimester the clearance of vasopressin is increased about 4-fold and at term up to 5-fold. After delivery, the clearance of vasopressin returns to preconception baseline within two weeks.

While ondansetron's mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, it is not a dopamine-receptor antagonist. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In normal volunteers, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. In another trial in 6 normal male volunteers, a 16 mg dose infused over 5 minutes showed no effect of the drug on cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, blood pressure, or ECG. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in normal volunteers. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations. In a gender balanced pharmacodynamic trial (n = 56), ondansetron 4 mg administered intravenously or intramuscularly was dynamically similar in the prevention of nausea and vomiting using the ipecacuanha model of emesis. Cardiac Electrophysiology QTc interval prolongation was studied in a double-blind, single intravenous dose, placebo- and positive-controlled, crossover trial in 58 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline correction was 19.5 (21.8) ms and 5.6 (7.4) ms after 15-minute intravenous infusions of 32 mg and 8 mg ondansetron, respectively. A significant exposure-response relationship was identified between ondansetron concentration and \u0394\u0394QTcF. Using the established exposure-response relationship, 24 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes had a mean predicted (95% upper prediction interval) \u0394\u0394QTcF of 14.0 (16.3) ms. In contrast, 16 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes using the same model had a mean predicted (95% upper prediction interval) \u0394\u0394QTcF of 9.1 (11.2) ms. In this study, the 8-mg dose infused over 15 minutes did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In normal adult volunteers, the following mean pharmacokinetic data have been determined following a single 0.15-mg/kg intravenous dose. Table 4: Pharmacokinetics in Normal Adult Volunteers Age-group (years) n Peak Plasma Concentration (ng/mL) Mean Elimination Half-life (h) Plasma Clearance (L/h/kg) 19 to 40 11 102 3.5 0.381 61 to 74 12 106 4.7 0.319 \u2265 75 11 170 5.5 0.262 Absorption A trial was performed in normal volunteers (n = 56) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single 4-mg dose administered as a 5-minute infusion compared with a single intramuscular injection. Systemic exposure as measured by mean area under curve (AUC) were equivalent, with values of 156 [95% CI 136, 180] and 161 [95% CI 137, 190] ng\u2022h/mL for intravenous and intramuscular groups, respectively. Mean peak plasma concentrations were 42.9 [95% CI 33.8, 54.4] ng/mL at 10 minutes after intravenous infusion and 31.9 [95% CI 26.3, 38.6] ng/mL at 41 minutes after intramuscular injection. Distribution Plasma protein binding of ondansetron as measured in vitro was 70% to 76%, over the pharmacologic concentration range of 10 to 500 ng/mL. Circulating drug also distributes into erythrocytes. Elimination Metabolism : Ondansetron is extensively metabolized in humans, with approximately 5% of a radiolabeled dose recovered as the parent compound from the urine. The primary metabolic pathway is hydroxylation on the indole ring followed by subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. Although some nonconjugated metabolites have pharmacologic activity, these are not found in plasma at concentrations likely to significantly contribute to the biological activity of ondansetron. The metabolites are observed in the urine. In vitro metabolism studies have shown that ondansetron is a substrate for multiple human hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. In terms of overall ondansetron turnover, CYP3A4 plays a predominant role while formation of the major in vivo metabolites is apparently mediated by CYP1A2. The role of CYP2D6 in ondansetron in vivo metabolism is relatively minor. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous ondansetron did not differ between subjects who were poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 and those who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, further supporting the limited role of CYP2D6 in ondansetron disposition in vivo . Excretion : In adult cancer patients, the mean ondansetron elimination half-life was 4.0 hours, and there was no difference in the multidose pharmacokinetics over a 4-day period. In a dose-proportionality trial, systemic exposure to 32 mg of ondansetron was not proportional to dose as measured by comparing dose-normalized AUC values with an 8-mg dose. This is consistent with a small decrease in systemic clearance with increasing plasma concentrations. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients : A reduction in clearance and increase in elimination half-life are seen in patients older than 75 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Pediatric Patients : Pharmacokinetic samples were collected from 74 cancer patients aged 6 to 48 months, who received a dose of 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron every 4 hours for 3 doses during a safety and efficacy trial. These data were combined with sequential pharmacokinetics data from 41 surgery patients aged 1 month to 24 months, who received a single dose of 0.1 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron prior to surgery with general anesthesia, and a population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on the combined data set. The results of this analysis are included in Table 5 and are compared with the pharmacokinetic results in cancer patients aged 4 to 18 years. Table 5: Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Cancer Patients Aged 1 Month to 18 Years a Population PK (Pharmacokinetic) Patients: 64% cancer patients and 36% surgery patients. Subjects and Age-group N CL (L/h/kg) Vd ss (L/kg) t \u00bd (h) Geometric Mean Mean Pediatric Cancer Patients 4 to 18 years N = 21 0.599 1.9 2.8 Population PK Patients a 1 month to 48 months N = 115 0.582 3.65 4.9 Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, cancer patients aged 6 to 48 months who receive a dose of 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron every 4 hours for 3 doses would be expected to achieve a systemic exposure (AUC) consistent with the exposure achieved in previous pediatric trials in cancer patients (4 to 18 years) at similar doses. In a trial of 21 pediatric patients (3 to 12 years) who were undergoing surgery requiring anesthesia for a duration of 45 minutes to 2 hours, a single intravenous dose of ondansetron, 2 mg (3 to 7 years) or 4 mg (8 to 12 years), was administered immediately prior to anesthesia induction. Mean weight-normalized clearance and volume of distribution values in these pediatric surgical patients were similar to those previously reported for young adults. Mean terminal half-life was slightly reduced in pediatric patients (range, 2.5 to 3 hours) in comparison with adults (range, 3 to 3.5 hours). In a trial of 51 pediatric patients (aged 1 month to 24 months) who were undergoing surgery requiring general anesthesia, a single intravenous dose of ondansetron, 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg, was administered prior to surgery. As shown in Table 6 , the 41 patients with pharmacokinetic data were divided into 2 groups, patients aged 1 month to 4 months and patients aged 5 to 24 months, and are compared with pediatric patients aged 3 to 12 years. Table 6: Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Surgery Patients Aged 1 Month to 12 Years Subjects and Age-group N CL (L/h/kg) Vd ss (L/kg) t \u00bd (h) Geometric Mean Mean Pediatric Surgery Patients 3 to 12 years N = 21 0.439 1.65 2.9 Pediatric Surgery Patients 5 to 24 months N = 22 0.581 2.3 2.9 Pediatric Surgery Patients 1 month to 4 months N = 19 0.401 3.5 6.7 In general, surgical and cancer pediatric patients younger than 18 years tend to have a higher ondansetron clearance compared with adults leading to a shorter half-life in most pediatric patients. In patients aged 1 month to 4 months, a longer half-life was observed due to the higher volume of distribution in this age-group. In a trial of 21 pediatric cancer patients (aged 4 to 18 years) who received three intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron at 4-hour intervals, patients older than 15 years exhibited ondansetron pharmacokinetic parameters similar to those of adults. Patients with Renal Impairment : Due to the very small contribution (5%) of renal clearance to the overall clearance, renal impairment was not expected to significantly influence the total clearance of ondansetron. However, ondansetron mean plasma clearance was reduced by about 41% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). This reduction in clearance is variable and was not consistent with an increase in half-life [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment : In patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced 2-fold and mean half-life is increased to 11.6 hours compared with 5.7 hours in those without hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10 or greater), clearance is reduced 2-fold to 3-fold and apparent volume of distribution is increased with a resultant increase in half-life to 20 hours [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interaction Studies CYP3A4 Inducers : Ondansetron elimination may be affected by cytochrome P-450 inducers. In a pharmacokinetic trial of 16 epileptic patients maintained chronically on CYP3A4 inducers, carbamazepine, or phenytoin, a reduction in AUC, C max , and t \u00bd of ondansetron was observed. This resulted in a significant increase in the clearance of ondansetron. In a pharmacokinetic study of 10 healthy subjects receiving a single-dose intravenous dose of ondansetron 8 mg after 600 mg rifampin once daily for five days, the AUC and the t \u00bd of ondansetron were reduced by 48% and 46%, respectively. These changes in ondansetron exposure with CYP3A4 inducers are not thought to be clinically relevant [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] .

Diastolic pressure falls. Renal blood flow is decreased in normotensive subjects but is increased markedly in shock. Systolic blood pressure may remain unchanged or rise, although mean arterial pressure typically falls. Cardiac output is increased because of the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of the drug in the face of diminished peripheral vascular resistance. Isoproterenol relaxes almost all varieties of smooth muscle when the tone is high, but this action is most pronounced on bronchial and gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It prevents or relieves bronchoconstriction, but tolerance to this effect develops with overuse of the drug. In man, isoproterenol causes less hyperglycemia than does epinephrine. Isoproterenol and epinephrine are equally effective in stimulating the release of free fatty acids and energy production. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Isoproterenol is readily absorbed when given parenterally or as an aerosol.

Orthoebolavirus zairense (EBOV) encodes a sole envelope protein, the glycoprotein, which mediates virus attachment and membrane fusion with the host cell membranes. In addition, GP is expressed on the surface of Orthoebolavirus zairense infected host cells making it a target for antibodies that can mediate killing of these cells by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or other effector functions. The 3 antibodies that make up the combination bind to 3 non-overlapping epitopes on GP and all 3 antibodies can bind the GP simultaneously. The mean K D values for atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab were 7.84 nM, 3.34 nM, and 8.26 nM, respectively, as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Maftivimab is a neutralizing antibody that blocks entry of the virus into susceptible cells. Odesivimab is a non-neutralizing antibody that induces antibody-dependent effector function through FcyRIIIa signaling when bound to its target. Odesivimab also binds to the soluble form of Orthoebolavirus zairense glycoprotein (sGP). Atoltivimab combines both neutralization and FcyRIIIa signaling activities. Antiviral Activity In a live virus infection assay on Vero cells, maftivimab neutralized Mayinga, Kikwit, and Makona strains of Orthoebolavirus zairense , with a concentration between 0.2 and 1.2 nM (0.03 and 0.18 \u03bcg/mL) providing 80% inhibition of viral infection in a plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT-80). Atoltivimab and odesivimab did not demonstrate any neutralizing activity in this assay. Effector function activity of INMAZEB individual antibodies was assessed with an EBOV Makona-GP expressing cell line and Jurkat/NFAT-Luc/Fc\u03b3RIIIa reporter effector cells. The EC 50 values of atoltivimab and odesivimab were 2.9 nM and 1.6 nM, respectively, whereas maftivimab did not exhibit any Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling activity at the maximum concentration tested, 40 nM. Treatment of Orthoebolavirus zairense infected rhesus macaques with a single intravenous dose of INMAZEB (50 mg of atoltivimab, 50 mg of maftivimab, and 50 mg of odesivimab per kg) generally protected infected animals from Orthoebolavirus zairense mediated death when drug was administered 5 days post-infection. Resistance No clinical data are available on the development of EBOV resistance to INMAZEB. Previously identified substitutions in EBOV were assessed for activity in binding, neutralization and ADCC. Results of these assays are presented in Table 7 , Table 8 , and Table 9 . The clinical significance of these substitutions is unknown.

IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and differentiation, recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils. Reslizumab binds to IL-5 with a dissociation constant of 81 pM, inhibiting the bioactivity of IL-5 by blocking its binding to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil surface. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) are involved in inflammation. Reslizumab, by inhibiting IL-5 signaling, reduces the production and survival of eosinophils; however, the mechanism of reslizumab action in asthma has not been definitively established. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical studies with CINQAIR 3 mg/kg, reductions in blood eosinophil counts were observed following the first dose and maintained through 52 weeks of treatment with no signs of tachyphylaxis. Mean eosinophil counts were 696 cells/mcL (n=245) and 624 cells/mcL (n=244) at baseline, and were 55 cells/mcL (92% reduction, n=212) and 496 cells /mcL (21% reduction, n=212) at the Week 52 visit for the CINQAIR and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Early eosinophil reduction was apparent in a subset of patients who had blood eosinophil counts assessed at days 2-3: 220 cells/mcL and 610/mcL for CINQAIR (n=35) and placebo (n=32), respectively. Eosinophils returned towards baseline in those CINQAIR-treated patients who completed a 90-day follow-up assessment (n=35, 480 cells/mcL), approximately 120 days after the last dose of CINQAIR. Reductions of blood eosinophils were related to reslizumab serum levels, i.e., greater reductions of blood eosinophils were observed in subjects with higher reslizumab serum concentrations. Treatment-emergent anti-reslizumab antibodies did not interfere with the blood eosinophil reduction effect by reslizumab. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics (PK) of reslizumab were characterized in healthy adults (n=130), in patients with asthma (n=438), and in other patient populations (n=236). The PK characteristics of reslizumab were similar across these populations. Inter-individual variability in peak and overall exposure was approximately 20-30%. Peak serum concentrations were typically observed at the end of the infusion. Serum reslizumab concentrations generally declined from peak in a biphasic manner. Following multiple doses, serum concentrations of reslizumab accumulated approximately 1.5 to 1.9-fold. Systemic exposure to reslizumab appeared to be unaffected by the presence of treatment-emergent anti-reslizumab antibodies. Distribution Reslizumab has a volume of distribution of approximately 5 liters, suggesting minimal distribution to the extravascular tissues. Metabolism Similar to other monoclonal antibodies, reslizumab is degraded by enzymatic proteolysis into small peptides and amino acids. As reslizumab binds to a soluble target, it is not expected to go through a target-mediated clearance. Elimination Reslizumab clearance was approximately 7 mL/hour. Reslizumab has a half-life of about 24 days. Specific Populations Age, Race, and Gender Population PK analyses demonstrated that there was no significant effect of age, race, or gender on the PK of reslizumab. Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to assess the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of reslizumab. The results of population PK analyses indicated that there was no significant difference in the PK of reslizumab between patients with normal liver function tests (total bilirubin less than or equal to the ULN and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] less than or equal to the ULN) and mildly increased liver function tests (total bilirubin above the ULN and less than or equal to 1.5-times the ULN or AST greater than ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to the ULN). Renal Impairment No clinical studies have been conducted to assess the effect of renal impairment on the PK of reslizumab. The results of population PK analyses indicated that there was no significant difference in the PK of reslizumab between patients with normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] greater than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), mild renal impairment (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Drug Interactions In vitro data indicate that IL-5 and reslizumab are unlikely to affect CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4 enzyme activity. No formal clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted with reslizumab. Population PK analyses indicate that concomitant use of either leukotriene antagonists or corticosteroids does not affect the PK of reslizumab."], "manufacturer_name": ["Teva Respiratory, LLC"], "substance_name": ["RESLIZUMAB"], "effective_time": "20200629", "product_ndc": ["59310-610"], "brand_name": ["CINQAIR"]}

Multiple dosing of 500 mg infused over 30 minutes produces mean plasma concentrations of about 49 mcg/mL at the completion of infusion, mean plasma concentrations of about 19 mcg/mL 2 hours after infusion, and mean plasma concentrations of about 10 mcg/mL 6 hours after infusion. The plasma concentrations during multiple dosing are like those after a single dose. Distribution The volume of distribution ranges from 0.3 to 0.43 L/kg after intravenous administration. Vancomycin is approximately 55% serum protein bound as measured by ultrafiltration at vancomycin serum concentrations of 10 to 100 mcg/mL. After intravenous administration of vancomycin, inhibitory concentrations are present in pleural, pericardial, ascitic, and synovial fluids; in urine; in peritoneal dialysis fluid; and in atrial appendage tissue. Vancomycin does not readily diffuse across normal meninges into the spinal fluid; but, when the meninges are inflamed, penetration into the spinal fluid occurs. Elimination Mean plasma clearance is about 0.058 L/kg/h, and mean renal clearance is about 0.048 L/kg/h. The mean elimination half-life of vancomycin from plasma is 4 to 6 hours in subjects with normal renal function. In anephric patients, the mean elimination half-life is 7.5 days. Total body and renal clearance of vancomycin may be reduced in the elderly. Metabolism There is no apparent metabolism of the vancomycin. Excretion In the first 24 hours after intravenous administration, about 75% of an administered dose of vancomycin is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration. Renal impairment slows excretion of vancomycin. About 60% of an intraperitoneal dose of vancomycin administered during peritoneal dialysis is absorbed systemically in 6 hours. Serum concentrations of about 10 mcg/mL are achieved by intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg of vancomycin. However, the safety and efficacy of the intraperitoneal use of vancomycin has not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal action of vancomycin results primarily from inhibition of cell-wall biosynthesis. In addition, vancomycin alters bacterial-cell-membrane permeability and RNA synthesis. Resistance Vancomycin is not active in vitro against gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, or fungi. There is no cross-resistance between vancomycin and other antibacterials. Interaction With Other Antimicrobials The combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside acts synergistically in vitro against many isolates of Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus gallolyticus (previously known as Streptococcus bovis ), enterococcus spp, and the viridans group streptococci. Antimicrobial Activity Vancomycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )]. Aerobic Gram-Positive Bacteria Corynebacterium spp. Enterococcus spp. (including Enterococcus faecalis ) Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible isolates) Coagulase negative staphylococci (including S. epidermidis and methicillin-resistant isolates) Streptococcus gallolyticus (previously known as Streptococcus bovis ) Viridans group streptococci The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for vancomycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of vancomycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

The mean area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) for nafcillin in this study was 18.06 mcg \u2022 h/mL. The serum half-life of nafcillin administered by the intravenous route ranged from 33 to 61 minutes as measured in three separate studies. In contrast to the other penicillinase-resistant penicillins, only about 30% of nafcillin is excreted as unchanged drug in the urine of normal volunteers, and most within the first six hours. Nafcillin is primarily eliminated by nonrenal routes, namely hepatic inactivation and excretion in the bile. Nafcillin binds to serum proteins, mainly albumin. The degree of protein binding reported for nafcillin is 89.9 \u00b1 1.5%. Reported values vary with the method of study and the investigator. The concurrent administration of probenecid with nafcillin increases and prolongs plasma concentrations of nafcillin. Probenecid significantly reduces the total body clearance of nafcillin with renal clearance being decreased to a greater extent than non-renal clearance. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins are widely distributed in various body fluids, including bile, pleural, amniotic and synovial fluids. With normal doses insignificant concentrations are found in the aqueous humor of the eye. High nafcillin CSF levels have been obtained in the presence of inflamed meninges. Renal failure does not appreciably affect the serum half-life of nafcillin; therefore, no modification of the usual nafcillin dosage is necessary in renal failure with or without hemodialysis. Hemodialysis does not accelerate the rate of clearance of nafcillin from the blood. A study which assessed the effects of cirrhosis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction in man demonstrated that the plasma clearance of nafcillin was significantly decreased in patients with hepatic dysfunction. In these patients with cirrhosis and extrahepatic obstruction, nafcillin excretion in the urine was significantly increased from about 30 to 50% of the administered dose, suggesting that renal disease superimposed on hepatic disease could further decrease nafcillin clearance.

Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Regadenoson is a low affinity agonist (K i \u2248 1.3 \u00b5M) for the A 2A adenosine receptor, with at least 10-fold lower affinity for the A 1 adenosine receptor (K i > 16.5 \u00b5M), and weak, if any, affinity for the A 2B and A 3 adenosine receptors. Activation of the A 2A adenosine receptor by regadenoson produces coronary vasodilation and increases coronary blood flow (CBF). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Coronary Blood Flow LEXISCAN causes a rapid increase in CBF which is sustained for a short duration. In patients undergoing coronary catheterization, pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography was used to measure the average peak velocity (APV) of coronary blood flow before and up to 30 minutes after administration of regadenoson (0.4 mg, intravenously). Mean APV increased to greater than twice baseline by 30 seconds and decreased to less than twice the baseline level within 10 minutes [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Myocardial uptake of the radiopharmaceutical is proportional to CBF. Because LEXISCAN increases blood flow in normal coronary arteries with little or no increase in stenotic arteries, LEXISCAN causes relatively less uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in vascular territories supplied by stenotic arteries. MPI intensity after LEXISCAN administration is therefore greater in areas perfused by normal relative to stenosed arteries. Effect of duration of injection A study in dogs compared the effects of intravenous injection of 2.5 \u03bcg/kg regadenoson (in 10 mL) over 10 seconds and 30 seconds on CBF. The duration of a two-fold increase in CBF was 97\u00b114 seconds (n=6) and 221\u00b120 seconds (n=4), respectively, for the 10 second and 30 second injections. The peak effects (i.e., maximal increase) on CBF after the 10 second and 30 second injections were 217\u00b115% and 297\u00b133% above baseline, respectively. The times to peak effect on CBF were 17\u00b12 seconds and 27\u00b16 seconds, respectively. Effect of Aminophylline Aminophylline (100 mg, administered by slow intravenous injection over 60 seconds) injected 1 minute after 0.4 mg LEXISCAN in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, was shown to shorten the duration of the coronary blood flow response to LEXISCAN as measured by pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Effect of Caffeine Ingestion of caffeine decreases the ability to detect reversible ischemic defects. In a placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical study, patients with known or suspected myocardial ischemia received a baseline rest/stress MPI followed by a second stress MPI. Patients received caffeine or placebo 90 minutes before the second LEXISCAN stress MPI. Following caffeine administration (200 or 400 mg), the mean number of reversible defects identified was reduced by approximately 60%. This decrease was statistically significant [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ]. Hemodynamic Effects In clinical studies, the majority of patients had an increase in heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure within 45 minutes after administration of LEXISCAN. Maximum hemodynamic changes after LEXISCAN and ADENOSCAN in Studies 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 5 .

In in vitro studies, regadenoson has not been shown to have appreciable binding affinity for the A 2B and A 3 adenosine receptors. In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 999 patients with a diagnosis, or risk factors for, coronary artery disease and concurrent asthma or COPD, the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions (dyspnea, wheezing) was greater with LEXISCAN compared to placebo. Moderate (2.5%) or severe (< 1%) respiratory reactions were observed more frequently in the LEXISCAN group compared to placebo [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects, the regadenoson plasma concentration-time profile is multi-exponential in nature and best characterized by 3-compartment model. The maximal plasma concentration of regadenoson is achieved within 1 to 4 minutes after injection of LEXISCAN and parallels the onset of the pharmacodynamic response. The half-life of this initial phase is approximately 2 to 4 minutes. An intermediate phase follows, with a half-life on average of 30 minutes coinciding with loss of the pharmacodynamic effect. The terminal phase consists of a decline in plasma concentration with a half-life of approximately 2 hours [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ]. Within the dose range of 0.3\u201320 \u00b5g/kg in healthy subjects, clearance, terminal half-life or volume of distribution do not appear dependent upon the dose. A population pharmacokinetic analysis including data from subjects and patients demonstrated that regadenoson clearance decreases in parallel with a reduction in creatinine clearance and clearance increases with increased body weight. Age, gender, and race have minimal effects on the pharmacokinetics of regadenoson. Specific Populations Renally Impaired Patients: The disposition of regadenoson was studied in 18 patients with various degrees of renal function and in 6 healthy subjects. With increasing renal impairment, from mild (CLcr 50 to < 80 mL/min) to moderate (CLcr 30 to < 50 mL/min) to severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), the fraction of regadenoson excreted unchanged in urine and the renal clearance decreased, resulting in increased elimination half-lives and AUC values compared to healthy subjects (CLcr \u2265 80 mL/min). However, the maximum observed plasma concentrations as well as volumes of distribution estimates were similar across the groups. The plasma concentration-time profiles were not significantly altered in the early stages after dosing when most pharmacologic effects are observed. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. Patients with End Stage Renal Disease: The pharmacokinetics of regadenoson in patients on dialysis has not been assessed; however, in an in vitro study regadenoson was found to be dialyzable. Hepatically Impaired Patients: The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of regadenoson has not been evaluated. Because greater than 55% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and factors that decrease clearance do not affect the plasma concentration in the early stages after dosing when clinically meaningful pharmacologic effects are observed, no dose adjustment is needed in patients with hepatic impairment. Geriatric Patients: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age has a minor influence on the pharmacokinetics of regadenoson. No dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients. Metabolism The metabolism of regadenoson is unknown in humans. Incubation with rat, dog, and human liver microsomes as well as human hepatocytes produced no detectable metabolites of regadenoson. Excretion In healthy volunteers, 57% of the regadenoson dose is excreted unchanged in the urine (range 19-77%), with an average plasma renal clearance around 450 mL/min, i.e., in excess of the glomerular filtration rate.

Levoleucovorin does not require reduction by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase in order to participate in reactions utilizing folates as a source of \u201cone-carbon\u201d moieties. Administration of levoleucovorin counteracts the therapeutic and toxic effects of folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. Combination with Fluorouracil in Colorectal Cancer Levoleucovorin enhances the therapeutic and toxic effects of fluorouracil. Fluorouracil is metabolized to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP), which binds to and inhibits thymidylate synthase (an enzyme important in DNA repair and replication). Levoleucovorin is converted to another reduced folate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, which acts to stabilize the binding of FdUMP to thymidylate synthase and thereby enhancing the inhibition of thymidylate synthase. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of levoleucovorin after intravenous administration of a 15 mg dose was studied in healthy subjects. The mean maximum serum total tetrahydrofolate (total-THF) concentrations was 1722 ng/mL (CV 39%) and the mean maximum serum (6S)-5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate concentrations was 275 ng/mL (CV 18%) observed around 0.9 hours post injection. Distribution Exploratory studies show that small quantities of systemically administered leucovorin enter the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), primarily as its major metabolite 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHFA). In humans, the CSF levels of 5-MTHFA remain 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than the usual methotrexate concentrations following intrathecal administration. Elimination The mean terminal half-life was 5.1 hours for total-THF and 6.8 hours for (6S)-5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate. Drug Interaction Studies The mean dose-normalized steady-state plasma concentrations for both levoleucovorin and 5-methyl-THF were comparable whether fluorouracil (370 mg/m 2 /day as an intravenous bolus) was given in combination with levoleucovorin (250 mg/m 2 and 1000 mg/m 2 as a continuous intravenous infusion for 5.5 days) or with d,l -leucovorin (500 mg/m 2 as a continuous intravenous infusion for 5.5 days)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "substance_name": ["LEVOLEUCOVORIN CALCIUM"], "effective_time": "20230801", "product_ndc": ["71288-105"], "brand_name": ["Levoleucovorin"]}

By the end of short-term intravenous infusion, peak serum concentrations of active clindamycin are reached. After intramuscular injection of clindamycin phosphate, peak concentrations of active clindamycin are reached within 3 hours in adults and 1 hour in pediatric patients. Serum concentrations of clindamycin can be maintained above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations for most indicated organisms by administration of clindamycin phosphate every 8 to 12 hours in adults and every 6 to 8 hours in pediatric patients, or by continuous intravenous infusion. An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose. No significant concentrations of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid even in the presence of inflamed meninges. Metabolism In vitro studies in human liver and intestinal microsomes indicated that clindamycin is predominantly metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with minor contribution from CYP3A5, to form clindamycin sulfoxide and a minor metabolite, N-desmethylclindamycin. Excretion Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears from the serum with 6 minutes of the average elimination half-life; however, the average serum elimination half-life of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2\u00bd hours in pediatric patients. Specific Populations Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules do not need to be modified in patients with renal or hepatic disease. Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61\u201379 years) and younger adults (18\u201339 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, the average elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4\u20135.1 h) in the elderly, compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1\u20134.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function 1 .

Microbiology Mechanism of Action Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic. Resistance Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B.Macrolide-inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test. Antimicrobial Activity Clindamycin has been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ] : Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pyogenes Anaerobic bacteria Clostridium perfringens Fusobacterium necrophorum Fusobacterium nucleatum Peptostreptococcus anaerobius Prevotella melaninogenica The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

Azacitidine for injection is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms.Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination MetabolismAn in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. SpecificPopulations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day.Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted.In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes:An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u00b5M) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems :An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."], "manufacturer_name": ["Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc."], "substance_name": ["AZACITIDINE"], "effective_time": "20241030", "product_ndc": ["75907-225"], "brand_name": ["Azacitidine"]}

Intravenous injection of etomidate produces anesthesia characterized by a rapid onset of action, usually within one minute. Duration of anesthesia is dose dependent but relatively brief, usually three to five minutes when an average dose of 0.3 mg/kg is employed. Immediate recovery from anesthesia (as assessed by awakening time, time needed to follow simple commands and time to perform simple tests after anesthesia as well as they were performed before anesthesia), based upon data derived from short operative procedures where intravenous etomidate was used for both induction and maintenance of anesthesia, is about as rapid as, or slightly faster than, immediate recovery after similar use of thiopental. These same data revealed that the immediate recovery period will usually be shortened in adult patients by the intravenous administration of approximately 0.1 mg of intravenous fentanyl, one or two minutes before induction of anesthesia, probably because less etomidate is generally required under these circumstances (consult the package insert for fentanyl before using). The most characteristic effect of intravenous etomidate on the respiratory system is a slight elevation in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Reduced cortisol plasma levels have been reported with induction doses of 0.3 mg/kg etomidate. These persist for approximately 6 to 8 hours and appear to be unresponsive to ACTH administration. The intravenous administration of up to 0.6 mg/kg of etomidate to patients with severe cardiovascular disease has little or no effect on myocardial metabolism, cardiac output, peripheral circulation or pulmonary circulation. The hemodynamic effects of etomidate have in most cases been qualitatively similar to those of thiopental sodium, except that the heart rate tended to increase by a moderate amount following administration of thiopental under conditions where there was little or no change in heart rate following administration of etomidate. However, clinical data indicates that etomidate administration in geriatric patients, particularly those with hypertension, may result in decreases in heart rate, cardiac index, and mean arterial blood pressure. There are insufficient data concerning use of etomidate in patients with recent severe trauma or hypovolemia to predict cardiovascular response under such circumstances. Clinical experience and special studies to date suggest that standard doses of intravenous etomidate ordinarily neither elevate plasma histamine nor cause signs of histamine release. Limited clinical experience, as well as animal studies, suggests that inadvertent intra-arterial injection of etomidate, unlike thiobarbiturates, will not usually be followed by necrosis of tissue distal to the injection site. Intra-arterial injection of etomidate is, however, not recommended. Etomidate induction is associated with a transient 20% to 30% decrease in cerebral blood flow. This reduction in blood flow appears to be uniform in the absence of intracranial space occupying lesions. As with other intravenous induction agents, reduction in cerebral oxygen utilization is roughly proportional to the reduction in cerebral blood flow. In patients with and without intracranial space occupying lesions, etomidate induction is usually followed by a moderate lowering of intracranial pressure, lasting several minutes. All of these studies provided for avoidance of hypercapnia. Information concerning regional cerebral perfusion in patients with intracranial space occupying lesions is too limited to permit definitive conclusions. Preliminary data suggests that etomidate will usually lower intraocular pressure moderately. Etomidate is rapidly metabolized in the liver. Minimal anesthetic plasma levels of unchanged drug are equal to or higher than 0.23 mcg/mL; they decrease rapidly up to 30 minutes following injection and thereafter more slowly with a half-life value of about 75 minutes. Approximately 75% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine during the first day after injection. The chief metabolite is R-(+)-1-(1-phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylic acid, resulting from hydrolysis of etomidate, and accounts for about 80% of the urinary excretion. Limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices suggest that the volume of distribution and elimination half-life of etomidate are approximately double that seen in healthy subjects. In clinical studies, elderly patients demonstrated decreased initial distribution volumes and total clearance of etomidate. Protein binding of etomidate to serum albumin was also significantly decreased in these individuals. Reduced plasma cortisol and aldosterone levels have been reported following induction doses of etomidate. These results persist for approximately 6 to 8 hours and appear to be unresponsive to ACTH stimulation.

The mean (SD) steady-state trough concentrations attained following the administration of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg every 24h were 5.9 (1.6), 6.7 (1.6), 10.3 (5.5), 12.9 (2.9), and 13.7 (5.2) mcg/mL, respectively. Daptomycin Administered over a 2-Minute Period in Adults Following IV administration of daptomycin over a 2-minute period to healthy adult volunteers at doses of 4 mg/kg (N=8) and 6 mg/kg (N=12), the mean (SD) steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) values were 475 (71) and 701 (82) mcg\u2022h/mL, respectively. Values for maximum plasma concentration (C max ) at the end of the 2-minute period could not be determined adequately in this study. However, using pharmacokinetic parameters from 14 healthy adult volunteers who received a single dose of daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 30-minute period in a separate study, steady-state C max values were simulated for daptomycin 4 and 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 2-minute period. The simulated mean (SD) steady-state C max values were 77.7 (8.1) and 116.6 (12.2) mcg/mL, respectively. Distribution Daptomycin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin, in a concentration-independent manner. The overall mean binding ranges from 90 to 93%. In clinical studies, mean serum protein binding in adult subjects with creatinine clearance (CL CR ) \u226530 mL/min was comparable to that observed in healthy adult subjects with normal renal function. However, there was a trend toward decreasing serum protein binding among subjects with CL CR <30 mL/min (88%), including those receiving hemodialysis (86%) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (84%). The protein binding of daptomycin in adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was similar to that in healthy adult subjects. The volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) of daptomycin in healthy adult subjects was approximately 0.1 L/kg and was independent of dose. Metabolism In in vitro studies, daptomycin was not metabolized by human liver microsomes. In 5 healthy adults after infusion of radiolabeled 14 C-daptomycin, the plasma total radioactivity was similar to the concentration determined by microbiological assay. Inactive metabolites were detected in urine, as determined by the difference between total radioactive concentrations and microbiologically active concentrations. In a separate study, no metabolites were observed in plasma on Day 1 following the administration of daptomycin at 6 mg/kg to adult subjects. Minor amounts of three oxidative metabolites and one unidentified compound were detected in urine. The site of metabolism has not been identified. Excretion Daptomycin is excreted primarily by the kidneys. In a mass balance study of 5 healthy adult subjects using radiolabeled daptomycin, approximately 78% of the administered dose was recovered from urine based on total radioactivity (approximately 52% of the dose based on microbiologically active concentrations), and 5.7% of the administered dose was recovered from feces (collected for up to 9 days) based on total radioactivity. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Population-derived pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for infected adult patients (complicated skin and skin structure infections [cSSSI] and S. aureus bacteremia) and noninfected adult subjects with various degrees of renal function ( Table 12 ). Total plasma clearance (CL T ), elimination half-life (t 1/2 ), and volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) in patients with cSSSI were similar to those in patients with S. aureus bacteremia. Following administration of daptomycin 4 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean CL T was 9%, 22%, and 46% lower among subjects and patients with mild (CL CR 50\u201380 mL/min), moderate (CL CR 30\u2013<50 mL/min), and severe (CL CR <30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, than in those with normal renal function (CL CR >80 mL/min). The mean steady-state systemic exposure (AUC), t 1/2 , and V ss increased with decreasing renal function, although the mean AUC for patients with CL CR 30\u201380 mL/min was not markedly different from the mean AUC for patients with normal renal function. The mean AUC for patients with CL CR <30 mL/min and for patients on dialysis (CAPD and hemodialysis dosed post-dialysis) was approximately 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, than for patients with normal renal function. The mean C max ranged from 60 to 70 mcg/mL in patients with CL CR \u226530 mL/min, while the mean C max for patients with CL CR <30 mL/min ranged from 41 to 58 mcg/mL. After administration of daptomycin 6 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean C max ranged from 80 to 114 mcg/mL in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and was similar to that of patients with normal renal function.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 10 adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and compared with those in healthy adult volunteers (N=9) matched for gender, age, and weight. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were not altered in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is warranted when daptomycin is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been evaluated. Gender No clinically significant gender-related differences in daptomycin pharmacokinetics have been observed. No dosage adjustment is warranted based on gender when daptomycin is administered. Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 12 healthy elderly subjects (\u226575 years of age) and 11 healthy young adult controls (18 to 30 years of age). Following administration of a single 4 mg/kg dose of daptomycin by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean total clearance of daptomycin was approximately 35% lower and the mean AUC 0-\u221e was approximately 58% higher in elderly subjects than in healthy young adult subjects. There were no differences in C max [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Obese Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 6 moderately obese (Body Mass Index [BMI] 25 to 39.9 kg/m 2 ) and 6 extremely obese (BMI \u226540 kg/m 2 ) adult subjects and controls matched for age, gender, and renal function. Following administration of daptomycin by IV infusion over a 30-minute period as a single 4 mg/kg dose based on total body weight, the total plasma clearance of daptomycin normalized to total body weight was approximately 15% lower in moderately obese subjects and 23% lower in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The AUC 0-\u221e of daptomycin was approximately 30% higher in moderately obese subjects and 31% higher in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The differences were most likely due to differences in the renal clearance of daptomycin. No adjustment of daptomycin dosage is warranted in obese patients. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric subjects was evaluated in 3 single-dose pharmacokinetic studies. In general, body weight-normalized total body clearance in pediatric patients was higher than in adults and increased with a decrease of age, whereas elimination half-life tends to decrease with a decrease of age. Body weight-normalized total body clearance and elimination half-life of daptomycin in children 2 to 6 years of age were similar at different doses. A study was conducted to assess safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric patients (1 to 17 years old, inclusive) with cSSSI caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Patients were enrolled into 4 age groups [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , and intravenous daptomycin doses of 5 to 10 mg/kg once daily were administered. Following administration of multiple doses, daptomycin exposure (AUC ss and C max,ss ) was similar across different age groups after dose adjustment based on body weight and age ( Table 13 ). Table 13: Mean (SD) Daptomycin Population Pharmacokinetic Parameters in cSSSI Pediatric Patients AUC ss , area under the concentration-time curve at steady state; CL T , clearance normalized to body weight; V ss , volume of distribution at steady state; t \u00bd , terminal half-life * Mean is calculated from N=2 Age Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg/kg) Infusion Duration (min) AUC ss (mcg\u2022h/mL) t 1/2 (h) V ss (mL) CL T (mL/h/kg) C max,ss (mcg/mL) 12 to 17 years (N=6) 5 30 434 (67.9) 7.1 (0.9) 8200 (3250) 11.8 (2.15) 76.4 (6.75) 7 to 11 years (N=2) 7 30 543 * 6.8 * 4470 * 13.2 * 92.4 * 2 to 6 years (N=7) 9 60 452 (93.1) 4.6 (0.8) 2750 (832) 20.8 (4.29) 90.3 (14.0) 1 to less than 2 years (N=27) 10 60 462 (138) 4.8 (0.6) 1670 (446) 23.1 (5.43) 81.6 (20.7) A study was conducted to assess safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric patients with S. aureus bacteremia.

Following administration of multiple doses, daptomycin exposure (AUC ss and C max,ss ) was similar across different age groups after dose adjustment based on body weight and age ( Table 14 ).

It is unlikely that daptomycin will inhibit or induce the metabolism of drugs metabolized by the P450 system. Aztreonam In a study in which 15 healthy adult subjects received a single dose of daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV and a combination dose of daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV and aztreonam 1 g IV, administered over a 30-minute period, the C max and AUC 0-\u221e of daptomycin were not significantly altered by aztreonam. Tobramycin In a study in which 6 healthy adult males received a single dose of daptomycin 2 mg/kg IV, tobramycin 1 mg/kg IV, and both in combination, administered over a 30-minute period, the mean C max and AUC 0- \u221e of daptomycin were 12.7% and 8.7% higher, respectively, when daptomycin was coadministered with tobramycin. The mean C max and AUC 0- \u221e of tobramycin were 10.7% and 6.6% lower, respectively, when tobramycin was coadministered with daptomycin. These differences were not statistically significant. The interaction between daptomycin and tobramycin with a clinical dose of daptomycin is unknown. Warfarin In 16 healthy adult subjects, administration of daptomycin 6 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 5 days, with coadministration of a single oral dose of warfarin (25 mg) on the 5th day, had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug and did not significantly alter the INR (International Normalized Ratio). Simvastatin In 20 healthy adult subjects on a stable daily dose of simvastatin 40 mg, administration of daptomycin 4 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 14 days (N=10) had no effect on plasma trough concentrations of simvastatin and was not associated with a higher incidence of adverse events, including skeletal myopathy, than in subjects receiving placebo once daily (N=10) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid (500 mg 4 times daily) and a single dose of daptomycin 4 mg/kg by IV infusion over a 30-minute period in adults did not significantly alter the C max or AUC 0-\u221e of daptomycin. 12.4 Microbiology Daptomycin belongs to the cyclic lipopeptide class of antibacterials. Daptomycin has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of daptomycin encompasses most clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro . This has been demonstrated both by time-kill curves and by MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. Daptomycin maintained bactericidal activity in vitro against stationary phase S. aureus in simulated endocardial vegetations. The clinical significance of this is not known. Mechanism of Action Daptomycin binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death. Resistance The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is not fully understood. Currently, there are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to daptomycin. Interactions with Other Antibacterials In vitro studies have investigated daptomycin interactions with other antibacterials. Antagonism, as determined by kill curve studies, has not been observed. In vitro synergistic interactions of daptomycin with aminoglycosides, \u03b2-lactam antibacterials, and rifampin have been shown against some isolates of staphylococci (including some methicillin-resistant isolates) and enterococci (including some vancomycin-resistant isolates). Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI in adult patients. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received daptomycin at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial. S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis and Other Post-Approval Trials in Adults In subsequent clinical trials in adult patients, non-susceptible isolates were recovered. S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a compassionate-use trial and from 7 patients in the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. An E. faecium was isolated from a patient in a vancomycin-resistant enterococci trial. Antimicrobial Activity Daptomycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . Gram-Positive Bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant isolates) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis Streptococcus pyogenes The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for daptomycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of daptomycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-Positive Bacteria Corynebacterium jeikeium Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-resistant isolates) Enterococcus faecium (including vancomycin-resistant isolates) Staphylococcus epidermidis (including methicillin-resistant isolates) Staphylococcus haemolyticus Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for daptomycin, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Avenacy Inc."], "substance_name": ["DAPTOMYCIN"], "effective_time": "20241130", "product_ndc": ["83634-107"], "brand_name": ["Daptomycin"]}

In aqueous media, busulfan hydrolyzes to release the methanesulfonate groups. This produces reactive carbonium ions that can alkylate DNA. DNA damage is thought to be responsible for much of the cytotoxicity of busulfan. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of busulfan were studied in 59 patients participating in a prospective trial of a busulfan-cyclophosphamide preparatory regimen prior to allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor stem cell transplantation. Patients received 0.8 mg/kg busulfan every six hours, for a total of 16 doses over four days.

Each mL of ADMELOG contains 100 units of insulin lispro, and the inactive ingredients: dibasic sodium phosphate (1.88 mg), glycerin (16 mg), metacresol (3.15 mg), zinc oxide (content adjusted to provide 0.0197 mg zinc ion), and Water for Injection, USP. Insulin lispro has a pH of 7.0 to 7.8. The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide. ADMELOG is latex free."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Regulation of glucose metabolism is the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogs, including insulin lispro products. Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis and enhance protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of ADMELOG After Subcutaneous Injection The pharmacodynamic profile of a single 0.3 unit/kg dose of ADMELOG administered subcutaneously was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study enrolling 30 patients with type 1 diabetes. In this study, the mean (SD) time to maximum effect of ADMELOG (measured by the peak rate of glucose infusion) was approximately 2.1 (0.8) hours. The mean (SD) area under the glucose infusion rate curves (measure of overall pharmacodynamic effect) and mean (SD) maximum glucose infusion rate were 1953.5 (547.3) mg/kg and 9.97 (2.37) mg/min/kg, respectively (see Figure 1 ). Figure 1: Mean Smoothed Glucose Infusion Rate Body Weight Standardized after Subcutaneous Injection of ADMELOG (0.3 unit/kg) in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs, including insulin lispro products, may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual. The rate of insulin absorption and, consequently, the onset of activity are known to be affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Figure 1 Pharmacodynamics of AMELOG after Intravenous Administration The glucose lowering effect of intravenous administration of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, was tested in 21 patients with type 1 diabetes. For the study, the patients' usual doses of insulin were held, and blood glucose concentrations were allowed to reach a stable range of 200 to 260 mg/dL during a one to three-hour run-in phase. The run-in phase was followed by a 6-hour assessment phase. During the assessment phase, patients received intravenous infusion of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, at an initial infusion rate of 0.5 units/hour. The infusion rate could be adjusted at regular timed intervals to achieve and maintain blood glucose concentrations between 100 to 160 mg/dL. The mean blood glucose levels during the assessment phase for patients on another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, therapy are summarized below in Table 3. All patients achieved the targeted glucose range at some point during the 6-hour assessment phase. At the endpoint, blood glucose was within the target range (100 to 160 mg/dL) for 17 of 20 patients treated with another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL. The average time (\u00b1SE) required to attain near normoglycemia was 129 \u00b1 14 minutes for another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL.

In this study, the mean observed area under the plasma insulin lispro concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity and peak plasma insulin lispro concentration were 12800 pg\u2219hr/mL and 5070 pg/mL, respectively. The median time to maximum plasma insulin lispro concentration was 0.83 hours after injection (see Figure 2 ). Figure 2: Mean Plasma Concentrations of ADMELOG after a Single Subcutaneous Administration of ADMELOG (0.3 unit/kg) in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes The absolute bioavailability of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, after subcutaneous injection ranges from 55% to 77% with doses between 0.1 to 0.2 unit/kg, inclusive. Figure 2 Distribution When administered intravenously as bolus injections of 0.1 and 0.2 unit/kg dose in two separate groups of healthy subjects, the mean volume of distribution of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, appeared to decrease with increase in dose (1.55 and 0.72 L/kg, respectively). Elimination Metabolism Human metabolism studies have not been conducted. However, animal studies indicate that the metabolism of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, is identical to that of regular human insulin. Excretion When administered intravenously, another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL demonstrated dose-dependent clearance, with a mean clearance of 21.0 mL/min/kg (0.1 unit/kg dose), and 9.6 mL/min/kg (0.2 unit/kg dose). Another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, demonstrated a mean t 1/2 of 0.85 hours (51 minutes) and 0.92 hours (55 minutes), respectively for 0.1 unit/kg and 0.2 unit/kg doses. Specific Populations The effects of age, gender, race, obesity, pregnancy, or smoking on the pharmacokinetics of ADMELOG have not been studied. Patients with Renal Impairment Type 2 diabetic patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed no difference in pharmacokinetics of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL. However, the sensitivity of the patients to insulin did change, with an increased response to insulin as the renal function declined. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Type 2 diabetic patients with impaired hepatic function showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, as compared to patients with no hepatic dysfunction.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Pantoprazole is a PPI that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to the (H + , K + )-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the (H + , K + )-ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours for all doses tested (20 mg to 120 mg). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Antisecretory Activity The magnitude and time course for inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated acid output (PSAO) by single doses (20 to 120 mg) of Pantoprazole Sodium for injection were assessed in a single-dose, open-label, placebo-controlled, dose-response study. The results of this study are shown in Table 3. Healthy subjects received a continuous infusion for 25 hours of pentagastrin (PG) at 1 mcg/kg/h, a dose known to produce submaximal gastric acid secretion. The placebo group showed a sustained, continuous acid output for 25 hours, validating the reliability of the testing model. Pantoprazole Sodium for injection had an onset of antisecretory activity within 15 to 30 minutes of administration. Doses of 20 to 80 mg of Pantoprazole Sodium for injection substantially reduced the 24-hour cumulative PSAO in a dose-dependent manner, despite a short plasma elimination half-life. Complete suppression of PSAO was achieved with 80 mg within approximately 2 hours and no further significant suppression was seen with 120 mg. The duration of action of Pantoprazole Sodium for injection was 24 hours.

In one study of gastric pH in healthy subjects, Pantoprazole Sodium for injection was administered orally (40 mg enteric coated tablets) or Pantoprazole Sodium for injection (40 mg) once daily for 5 days and pH was measured for 24 hours following the fifth dose. The outcome measure was median percent of time that pH was \u22654 and the results were similar for intravenous and oral medications; however, the clinical significance of this parameter is unknown. Serum Gastrin Effects Serum gastrin concentrations were assessed in two placebo-controlled studies. In a 5-day study of oral pantoprazole with 40 and 60 mg doses in healthy subjects, following the last dose on day 5, median 24-hour serum gastrin concentrations were elevated by 3- to 4-fold compared to placebo in both 40 and 60 mg dose groups. However, by 24 hours following the last dose, median serum gastrin concentrations for both groups returned to normal levels. In another placebo-controlled, 7-day study of 40 mg intravenous or oral pantoprazole in patients with GERD and a history of EE, the mean serum gastrin concentration increased approximately 50% from baseline and as compared with placebo, but remained within the normal range. During 6 days of repeated administration of Pantoprazole Sodium for injection in patients with ZE Syndrome, consistent changes of serum gastrin concentrations from baseline were not observed. Enterochromaffin-Like (ECL) Cell Effects There are no data available on the effects of intravenous pantoprazole sodium on ECL cells. In a nonclinical study in Sprague-Dawley rats, lifetime exposure (24 months) to oral pantoprazole at doses of 0.5 to 200 mg/kg/day resulted in dose-related increases in gastric ECL-cell proliferation and gastric neuroendocrine (NE)-cell tumors. Gastric NE-cell tumors in rats may result from chronic elevation of serum gastrin concentrations. The high density of ECL cells in the rat stomach makes this species highly susceptible to the proliferative effects of elevated gastrin concentrations produced by PPIs. However, there were no observed elevations in serum gastrin following the administration of oral pantoprazole at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day. In a separate study, a gastric NE-cell tumor without concomitant ECL-cell proliferative changes was observed in 1 female rat following 12 months of dosing with oral pantoprazole at 5 mg/kg/day and a 9 month off-dose recovery [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Endocrine Effects In a clinical pharmacology study, pantoprazole 40 mg given orally once daily for 2 weeks had no effect on the levels of the following hormones: cortisol, testosterone, triiodothyronine (T 3 ), thyroxine (T 4 ), thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyronine-binding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin, aldosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin and growth hormone. In a 1-year study of GERD patients treated with pantoprazole 40 mg or 20 mg, there were no changes from baseline in overall levels of T 3 , T 4 , and TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pantoprazole peak serum concentration (C max ) and area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) increase in a manner proportional to intravenous doses from 10 mg to 80 mg. Pantoprazole does not accumulate and its pharmacokinetics are unaltered with multiple daily dosing. Following the administration of Pantoprazole Sodium for Injection, the serum concentration of pantoprazole declines biexponentially with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately one hour. In CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] with normal liver function receiving a 40 mg dose of Pantoprazole Sodium for Injection by constant rate over 15 minutes, the peak concentration (C max ) is 5.52 \u00b11.42 mcg/mL and the total area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) is 5.4 \u00b11.5 mcg hr/mL. The total clearance is 7.6 to 14 L/h. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of pantoprazole is approximately 11 to 23.6 L, distributing mainly in extracellular fluid. The serum protein binding of pantoprazole is about 98%, primarily to albumin. Elimination Metabolism Pantoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Pantoprazole metabolism is independent of the route of administration (intravenous or oral). The main metabolic pathway is demethylation, by CYP2C19, with subsequent sulfation; other metabolic pathways include oxidation by CYP3A4. There is no evidence that any of the pantoprazole metabolites have significant pharmacologic activity. CYP2C19 displays a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some sub-populations (e.g., 3% of Caucasians and African-Americans and 17 to 23% of Asians). Although these sub-populations of slow pantoprazole metabolizers have elimination half-life values from 3.5 to 10 hours, they still have minimal accumulation (23% or less) with once daily dosing. Excretion After administration of a single intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled pantoprazole sodium to healthy, extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers, approximately 71% of the dose was excreted in the urine with 18% excreted in the feces through biliary excretion. There was no renal excretion of unchanged pantoprazole. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients After repeated intravenous administration in elderly subjects (65 to 76 years of age), the AUC and elimination half-life values of pantoprazole were similar to those observed in younger subjects. Male and Female Patients After oral administration there was a modest increase in the AUC and C max of pantoprazole in women compared to men. However, weight-normalized clearance values are similar in women and men. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment, pharmacokinetic parameters for pantoprazole were similar to those of healthy subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A to C), maximum pantoprazole concentrations increased only slightly (1.5-fold) relative to healthy subjects when pantoprazole sodium was administered orally. Although serum half-life values increased to 7 to 9 hours and AUC values increased by 5- to 7-fold in hepatic-impaired patients, these increases were no greater than those observed in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, where no dosage adjustment is warranted. These pharmacokinetic changes in hepatic-impaired patients result in minimal drug accumulation following once-daily, multiple-dose administration. Oral pantoprazole doses higher than 40 mg per day have not been studied in hepatically impaired patients. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on Pantoprazole Pantoprazole is metabolized mainly by CYP2C19 and to minor extents by CYPs 3A4, 2D6 and 2C9. In in vivo drug-drug interaction studies with CYP2C19 substrates (diazepam [also a CYP3A4 substrate] and phenytoin [also a CYP3A4 inducer]), nifedipine, midazolam, and clarithromycin (CYP3A4 substrates), metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate), diclofenac, naproxen and piroxicam (CYP2C9 substrates) and theophylline (a CYP1A2 substrate) in healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole were not significantly altered. Effect of Pantoprazole on Other Drugs Clopidogrel Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. In a crossover clinical study, 66 healthy subjects were administered clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg per day) alone and with oral pantoprazole (80 mg at the same time as clopidogrel) for 5 days. On Day 5, the mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 14% (geometric mean ratio was 86%, with 90% CI of 79 to 93%) when pantoprazole sodium was coadministered with clopidogrel as compared to clopidogrel administered alone. Pharmacodynamic parameters were also measured and demonstrated that the change in inhibition of platelet aggregation (induced by 5 micromolar ADP) was correlated with the change in the exposure to clopidogrel active metabolite. The clinical significance of this finding is not clear. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) Administration of oral pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily for 4 days and a single 1000 mg dose of MMF approximately one hour after the last dose of pantoprazole to 12 healthy subjects in a cross-over study resulted in a 57% reduction in the C max and 27% reduction in the AUC of MPA. Transplant patients receiving approximately 2000 mg per day of MMF (n=12) were compared to transplant patients receiving approximately the same dose of MMF and oral pantoprazole 40 mg per day (n=21). There was a 78% reduction in the C max and a 45% reduction in the AUC of MPA in patients receiving both pantoprazole and MMF [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Other Drugs In vivo studies also suggest that pantoprazole does not significantly affect the kinetics of other drugs (cisapride, theophylline, diazepam [and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam], phenytoin, metoprolol, nifedipine, carbamazepine, midazolam, clarithromycin, diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam and oral contraceptives [levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol]). In other in vivo studies, digoxin, ethanol, glyburide, antipyrine, caffeine, metronidazole, and amoxicillin had no clinically relevant interactions with pantoprazole. Although no significant drug-drug interactions have been observed in clinical studies, the potential for significant drug-drug interactions with more than once daily dosing with high doses of pantoprazole has not been studied in poor metabolizers or individuals who are hepatically impaired. Antacids There was also no interaction with concomitantly administered antacids. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C19 displays a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some subpopulations (e.g., approximately 3% of Caucasians and African-Americans and 17% to 23% of Asians are poor metabolizers). Although these subpopulations of pantoprazole poor metabolizers have elimination half-life values of 3.5 to 10.0 hours in adults, they still have minimal accumulation (23% or less) with once-daily dosing. For adult patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, no dosage adjustment is needed. Similar to adults, pediatric patients who have the poor metabolizer genotype of CYP2C19 (CYP2C19 *2/*2) exhibited greater than a 6-fold increase in AUC compared to pediatric extensive (CYP2C19 *1/*1) and intermediate (CYP2C19 *1/*x) metabolizers. Poor metabolizers exhibited approximately 10-fold lower apparent oral clearance compared to extensive metabolizers."], "manufacturer_name": ["Piramal Critical Care"], "substance_name": ["PANTOPRAZOLE SODIUM"], "effective_time": "20240430", "product_ndc": ["66794-258"], "brand_name": ["PANTOPRAZOLE SODIUM I.V."]}

A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for Injection, USP in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for Injection, USP, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for Injection, USP in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Meropenem for Injection, USP is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection, USP in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection, USP in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection, USP, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group.

In subjects with normal kidney function, multiple intravenous dosing of 1 gram of vancomycin (15 mg/kg) infused over 60 minutes produces mean plasma concentrations of approximately 63 mcg/mL immediately after the completion of infusion, mean plasma concentrations of approximately 23 mcg/mL 2 hours after infusion, and mean plasma concentrations of approximately 8 mcg/mL 11 hours after the end of the infusion. Multiple dosing of 500 mg infused over 30 minutes produces mean plasma concentrations of about 49 mcg/mL at the completion of infusion, mean plasma concentrations of about 19 mcg/mL 2 hours after infusion, and mean plasma concentrations of about 10 mcg/mL 6 hours after infusion. The plasma concentrations during multiple dosing are similar to those after a single dose. The mean elimination half-life of vancomycin from plasma is 4 to 6 hours in subjects with normal renal function. In the first 24 hours, about 75% of an administered dose of vancomycin is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration. Mean plasma clearance is about 0.058 L/kg/h, and mean renal clearance is about 0.048 L/kg/h. Renal dysfunction slows excretion of vancomycin. In anephric patients, the average half-life of elimination is 7.5 days. The distribution coefficient is from 0.3 to 0.43 L/kg. There is no apparent metabolism of the drug. About 60% of an intraperitoneal dose of vancomycin administered during peritoneal dialysis is absorbed systemically in 6 hours. Serum concentrations of about 10 mcg/mL are achieved by intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg of vancomycin. However, the safety and efficacy of the intraperitoneal use of vancomycin has not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials (see PRECAUTIONS ). Total systemic and renal clearance of vancomycin may be reduced in the elderly. Vancomycin is approximately 55% serum protein bound as measured by ultrafiltration at vancomycin serum concentrations of 10 to 100 mcg/mL. After IV administration of vancomycin, inhibitory concentrations are present in pleural, pericardial, ascitic, and synovial fluids; in urine; in peritoneal dialysis fluid; and in atrial appendage tissue. Vancomycin does not readily diffuse across normal meninges into the spinal fluid; but, when the meninges are inflamed, penetration into the spinal fluid occurs. MICROBIOLOGY The bactericidal action of vancomycin results primarily from inhibition of cell-wall biosynthesis. In addition, vancomycin alters bacterial-cell-membrane permeability and RNA synthesis. There is no cross-resistance between vancomycin and other antibiotics. Vancomycin is not active in vitro against gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, or fungi.

Gemcitabine Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Gemcitabine kills cells undergoing DNA synthesis and blocks the progression of cells through the G1/S-phase boundary. Gemcitabine is metabolized by nucleoside kinases to diphosphate (dFdCDP) and triphosphate (dFdCTP) nucleosides. Gemcitabine diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate deoxynucleoside triphosphates for DNA synthesis, resulting in reductions in deoxynucleotide concentrations, including dCTP. Gemcitabine triphosphate competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP by the action of the diphosphate enhances the incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA (self-potentiation). After the gemcitabine nucleotide is incorporated into DNA, only one additional nucleotide is added to the growing DNA strands which eventually results in the initiation of apoptotic cell death. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine were examined in 353 patients, with various solid tumors. Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using data from patients treated for varying durations of therapy given weekly with periodic rest weeks and using both short infusions (<70 minutes) and long infusions (70 to 285 minutes). The total gemcitabine dose varied from 500 mg/m 2 to 3600 mg/m 2 . Distribution The volume of distribution was increased with infusion length. Volume of distribution of gemcitabine was 50 L/m 2 following infusions lasting <70 minutes. For long infusions, the volume of distribution rose to 370 L/m 2 . Gemcitabine pharmacokinetics are linear and are described by a 2-compartment model. Population pharmacokinetic analyses of combined single and multiple dose studies showed that the volume of distribution of gemcitabine was significantly influenced by duration of infusion and sex. Gemcitabine plasma protein binding is negligible. Elimination Metabolism The active metabolite, gemcitabine triphosphate, can be extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The half-life of the terminal phase for gemcitabine triphosphate from mononuclear cells ranges from 1.7 to 19.4 hours. Excretion Gemcitabine disposition was studied in 5 patients who received a single 1000 mg/m 2 of radiolabeled drug as a 30-minute infusion. Within one (1) week, 92% to 98% of the dose was recovered, almost entirely in the urine. Gemcitabine (<10%) and the inactive uracil metabolite, 2\u00b4-deoxy-2\u00b4,2\u00b4-difluorouridine (dFdU), accounted for 99% of the excreted dose. The metabolite dFdU is also found in plasma. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Clearance of gemcitabine was affected by age. The lower clearance in geriatric patients results in higher concentrations of gemcitabine for any given dose. Differences in either clearance or volume of distribution based on patient characteristics or the duration of infusion result in changes in half-life and plasma concentrations. Table 15 shows plasma clearance and half-life of gemcitabine following short infusions for typical patients by age and sex. Gemcitabine half-life for short infusions ranged from 42 to 94 minutes, and for long infusions varied from 245 to 638 minutes, depending on age and sex, reflecting a greatly increased volume of distribution with longer infusions. Male and Female Patients Females have lower clearance and longer half-lives than male patients as described in Table 15.

Drug Interaction Studies When gemcitabine (1250 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 8) and cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 on Day 1) were administered in patients with NSCLC, the clearance of gemcitabine on Day 1 was 128 L/hr/m 2 and on Day 8 was 107 L/hr/m 2 . Data from patients with NSCLC demonstrate that gemcitabine and carboplatin given in combination does not alter the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine or carboplatin compared to administration of either single agent, however, due to wide confidence intervals and small sample size, interpatient variability may be observed. Data from patients with metastatic breast cancer shows that gemcitabine has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics (clearance and half-life) of paclitaxel and paclitaxel has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine."], "manufacturer_name": ["Mylan Institutional LLC"], "substance_name": ["GEMCITABINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20241111", "product_ndc": ["67457-616", "67457-617", "67457-618"], "brand_name": ["Gemcitabine"]}

Each mL contains midazolam hydrochloride,USP equivalent to 5 mg midazolam compounded with 0.8% sodium chloride; the pH is adjusted to approximately 3 (2.5 to 3.5) and is adjusted with sodium hydroxide and, if necessary, hydrochloric acid. Midazolam is a white to light yellow crystalline compound, insoluble in water. The hydrochloride salt of midazolam, which is formed in situ, is soluble in aqueous solutions. Chemically, midazolam HCl,USP is 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine hydrochloride. Midazolam hydrochloride,USP has the empirical formula C18H13ClFN3\u2022HCl, a calculated molecular weight of 362.25 and the following structural formula: Under the acidic conditions required to solubilize midazolam in the product, midazolam is present as an equilibrium mixture (shown below) of the closed ring form shown above and an open-ring structure formed by the acid-catalyzed ring opening of the 4,5-double bond of the diazepine ring. The amount of open-ring form is dependent upon the pH of the solution. At the specified pH of the product, the solution may contain up to about 25% of the open-ring compound. At the physiologic conditions under which the product is absorbed (pH of 5 to 8) into the systemic circulation, any open-ring form present reverts to the physiologically active, lipophilic, closed-ring form (midazolam) and is absorbed as such. The following chart plots the percentage of midazolam present as the open-ring form as a function of pH in aqueous solutions. As indicated in the graph, the amount of open-ring compound present in solution is sensitive to changes in pH over the pH range specified for the product: 3.0 to 4.0 for the 1 mg/mL concentration and 3.0 to 3.6 for the 5 mg/mL concentration.

Structural Formula Midazolam img-3"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Pharmacodyncamics: The effects of midazolam on the CNS are dependent on the dose administered, the route of administration, and the presence or absence of other medications. Onset time of sedative effects after IM administration in adults is 15 minutes, with peak sedation occurring 30 to 60 minutes following injection. In one adult study, when tested the following day, 73% of the patients who received midazolam hydrochloride intramuscularly had no recall of memory cards shown 30 minutes following drug administration; 40% had no recall of the memory cards shown 60 minutes following drug administration. Onset time of sedative effects in the pediatric population begins within 5 minutes and peaks at 15 to 30 minutes depending upon the dose administered. In pediatric patients, up to 85% had no recall of pictures shown after receiving intramuscular midazolam compared with 5% of the placebo controls. Sedation in adult and pediatric patients is achieved within 3 to 5 minutes after intravenous (IV) injection; the time of onset is affected by total dose administered and the concurrent administration of narcotic premedication. Seventy-one percent of the adult patients in endoscopy studies had no recall of introduction of the endoscope; 82% of the patients had no recall of withdrawal of the endoscope. In one study of pediatric patients undergoing lumbar puncture or bone marrow aspiration, 88% of patients had impaired recall vs 9% of the placebo controls. In another pediatric oncology study, 91% of midazolam treated patients were amnestic compared with 35% of patients who had received fentanyl alone. When midazolam hydrochloride is given IV as an anesthetic induction agent, induction of anesthesia occurs in approximately 1.5 minutes when narcotic premedication has been administered and in 2 to 2.5 minutes without narcotic premeditation or other sedative premedication. Some impairment in a test of memory was noted in 90% of the patients studied. A dose response study of pediatric patients premedicated with 1 mg/kg intramuscular (IM) meperidine found that only 4 out of 6 pediatric patients who received 600 mcg/kg IV midazolam lost consciousness, with eye closing at 108 \u00b1 140 seconds. This group was compared with pediatric patients who were given thiopental 5 mg/kg IV; 6 out of 6 closed their eyes at 20 \u00b1 3.2 seconds. Midazolam did not dependably induce anesthesia at this dose despite concomitant opioid administration in pediatric patients. Midazolam, used as directed, does not delay awakening from general anesthesia in adults. Gross tests of recovery after awakening (orientation, ability to stand and walk, suitability for discharge from the recovery room, return to baseline Trieger competency) usually indicate recovery within 2 hours but recovery may take up to 6 hours in some cases. When compared with patients who received thiopental, patients who received midazolam generally recovered at a slightly slower rate. Recovery from anesthesia or sedation for procedures in pediatric patients depends on the dose of midazolam administered, coadministration of other medications causing CNS depression and duration of the procedure. In patients without intracranial lesions, induction of general anesthesia with IV midazolam hydrochloride is associated with a moderate decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure (lumbar puncture measurements), similar to that observed following IV thiopental. Preliminary data in neurosurgical patients with normal intracranial pressure but decreased compliance (subarachnoid screw measurements) show comparable elevations of intracranial pressure with midazolam and with thiopental during intubation. No similar studies have been reported in pediatric patients. The usual recommended intramuscular premedicating doses of midazolam hydrochloride do not depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation to a clinically significant extent in adults. Intravenous induction doses of midazolam hydrochloride depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation for 15 minutes or more beyond the duration of ventilatory depression following administration of thiopental in adults. Impairment of ventilatory response to carbon dioxide is more marked in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Sedation with IV midazolam does not adversely affect the mechanics of respiration (resistance, static recoil, most lung volume measurements); total lung capacity and peak expiratory flow decrease significantly but static compliance and maximum expiratory flow at 50% of awake total lung capacity (V max ) increase. In one study of pediatric patients under general anesthesia, intramuscular midazolam (100 or 200 mcg/kg) was shown to depress the response to carbon dioxide in a dose-related manner. In cardiac hemodynamic studies in adults, IV induction of general anesthesia with midazolam hydrochloride was associated with a slight to moderate decrease in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance. Slow heart rates (less than 65/minute), particularly in patients taking propranolol for angina, tended to rise slightly; faster heart rates (e.g., 85/minute) tended to slow slightly. In pediatric patients, a comparison of IV midazolam (500 mcg/kg) with propofol (2.5 mg/kg) revealed a mean 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure in patients who had received IV midazolam vs a mean 25% decrease in systolic blood pressure following propofol. Pharmacokinetics: Midazolam's activity is primarily due to the parent drug. Elimination of the parent drug takes place via hepatic metabolism of midazolam to hydroxylated metabolites that are conjugated and excreted in the urine. Six single-dose pharmacokinetic studies involving healthy adults yield pharmacokinetic parameters for midazolam in the following ranges: volume of distribution (Vd), 1.0 to 3.1 L/kg; elimination half-life, 1.8 to 6.4 hours (mean approximately 3 hours); total clearance (Cl), 0.25 to 0.54 L/hr/kg. In a parallel group study, there was no difference in the clearance, in subjects administered 0.15 mg/kg (n=4) and 0.3 mg/kg (n=4) IV doses indicating linear kinetics. The clearance was successively reduced by approximately 30% at doses of 0.45 mg/kg (n=4) and 0.6 mg/kg (n=5) indicating non-linear kinetics in this dose range. Absorption : The absolute bioavailability of the intramuscular route was greater than 90% in a cross-over study in which healthy subjects (n=17) were administered a 7.5 mg IV or IM dose. The mean peak concentration (C max ) and time to peak (T max ) following the IM dose was 90 ng/mL (20% CV) and 0.5 hr (50% CV). C max for the 1-hydroxy metabolite following the IM dose was 8 ng/mL (T max =1.0 hr). Following IM administration, C max for midazolam and its 1-hydroxy metabolite were approximately one-half of those achieved after intravenous injection. Distribution : The volume of distribution (Vd) determined from six single-dose pharmacokinetic studies involving healthy adults ranged from 1.0-3.1 L/kg. Female gender, old age, and obesity are associated with increased values of midazolam Vd. In humans, midazolam has been shown to cross the placenta and enter into fetal circulation and has been detected in human milk and CSF (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations ). In adults and children older than 1 year, midazolam is approximately 97% bound to plasma protein, principally albumin. Metabolism : In vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicate that the biotransformation of midazolam is mediated by cytochrome P450-3A4. This cytochrome also appears to be present in gastrointestinal tract mucosa as well as liver. Sixty to seventy percent of the biotransformation products is 1-hydroxy-midazolam (also termed alpha-hydroxymidazolam) while 4-hydroxy-midazolam constitutes 5% or less. Small amounts of a dihydroxy derivative have also been detected but not quantified. The principal urinary excretion products are glucuronide conjugates of the hydroxylated derivatives. Drugs that inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450-3A4 may inhibit midazolam clearance and elevate steady-state midazolam concentrations. Studies of the intravenous administration of 1-hydroxy-midazolam in humans suggest that 1-hydroxy-midazolam is at least as potent as the parent compound and may contribute to the net pharmacologic activity of midazolam. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the affinities of 1- and 4-hydroxy-midazolam for the benzodiazepine receptor are approximately 20% and 7%, respectively, relative to midazolam. Excretion : Clearance of midazolam is reduced in association with old age, congestive heart failure, liver disease (cirrhosis) or conditions which diminish cardiac output and hepatic blood flow. The principal urinary excretion product is 1-hydroxy-midazolam in the form of a glucuronide conjugate; smaller amounts of the glucuronide conjugates of 4-hydroxy- and dihydroxy-midazolam are detected as well. The amount of midazolam excreted unchanged in the urine after a single IV dose is less than 0.5% (n=5). Following a single IV infusion in 5 healthy volunteers, 45% to 57% of the dose was excreted in the urine as 1-hydroxymethyl midazolam conjugate. Pharmacokinetics-continuous infusion: The pharmacokinetic profile of midazolam following continuous infusion, based on 282 adult subjects, has been shown to be similar to that following single-dose administration for subjects of comparable age, gender, body habitus and health status. However, midazolam can accumulate in peripheral tissues with continuous infusion. The effects of accumulation are greater after long-term infusions than after short-term infusions. The effects of accumulation can be reduced by maintaining the lowest midazolam infusion rate that produces satisfactory sedation. Infrequent hypotensive episodes have occurred during continuous infusion; however, neither the time to onset nor the duration of the episode appeared to be related to plasma concentrations of midazolam or alpha-hydroxy-midazolam. Further, there does not appear to be an increased chance of occurrence of a hypotensive episode with increased loading doses. Patients with renal impairment may have longer elimination half-lives for midazolam (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations: Renal Failure ). Special Populations: Changes in the pharmacokinetic profile of midazolam due to drug interactions, physiological variables, etc., may result in changes in the plasma concentration-time profile and pharmacological response to midazolam in these patients. For example, patients with acute renal failure appear to have a longer elimination half-life for midazolam and may experience delayed recovery (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations: Renal Failure ). In other groups, the relationship between prolonged half-life and duration of effect has not been established. Pediatrics and Neonates: In pediatric patients aged 1 year and older, the pharmacokinetic properties following a single dose of midazolam reported in 10 separate studies of midazolam are similar to those in adults. Weight-normalized clearance is similar or higher (0.19 to 0.80 L/hr/kg) than in adults and the terminal elimination half-life (0.78 to 3.3 hours) is similar to or shorter than in adults. The pharmacokinetic properties during and following continuous intravenous infusion in pediatric patients in the operating room as an adjunct to general anesthesia and in the intensive care environment are similar to those in adults. In seriously ill neonates, however, the terminal elimination half-life of midazolam is substantially prolonged (6.5 to 12.0 hours) and the clearance reduced (0.07 to 0.12 L/hr/kg) compared to healthy adults or other groups of pediatric patients. It cannot be determined if these differences are due to age, immature organ function or metabolic pathways, underlying illness or debility. Obese : In a study comparing normals (n=20) and obese patients (n=20) the mean half-life was greater in the obese group (5.9 vs 2.3 hrs). This was due to an increase of approximately 50% in the Vd corrected for total body weight. The clearance was not significantly different between groups. Geriatric : In three parallel group studies, the pharmacokinetics of midazolam administered IV or IM were compared in young (mean age 29, n=52) and healthy elderly subjects (mean age 73, n=53). Plasma half-life was approximately two-fold higher in the elderly. The mean Vd based on total body weight increased consistently between 15% to 100% in the elderly. The mean Cl decreased approximately 25% in the elderly in two studies and was similar to that of the younger patients in the other. Congestive Heart Failure: In patients suffering from congestive heart failure, there appeared to be a two-fold increase in the elimination half-life, a 25% decrease in the plasma clearance and a 40% increase in the volume of distribution of midazolam. Hepatic Insufficiency : Midazolam pharmacokinetics were studied after an IV single dose (0.075 mg/kg) was administered to 7 patients with biopsy proven alcoholic cirrhosis and 8 control patients. The mean half-life of midazolam increased 2.5-fold in the alcoholic patients. Clearance was reduced by 50% and the Vd increased by 20%. In another study in 21 male patients with cirrhosis, without ascites and with normal kidney function as determined by creatinine clearance, no changes in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam or 1-hydroxy-midazolam were observed when compared to healthy individuals. Renal Failure: Patients with renal impairment may have longer elimination half-lives for midazolam and its metabolites which may result in slower recovery. Midazolam and 1-hydroxy-midazolam pharmacokinetics in 6 ICU patients who developed acute renal failure (ARF) were compared with a normal renal function control group. Midazolam was administered as an infusion (5 to 15 mg/hr). Midazolam clearance was reduced (1.9 vs 2.8 mL/min/kg) and the half-life was prolonged (7.6 vs 13 hr) in the ARF patients. The renal clearance of the 1-hydroxy-midazolam glucuronide was prolonged in the ARF group (4 vs 136 mL/min) and the half-life was prolonged (12 hr vs >25 hr). Plasma levels accumulated in all ARF patients to about ten times that of the parent drug. The relationship between accumulating metabolite levels and prolonged sedation is unclear. In a study of chronic renal failure patients (n=15) receiving a single IV dose, there was a two-fold increase in the clearance and volume of distribution but the half-life remained unchanged. Metabolite levels were not studied. Plasma Concentration-Effect Relationship: Concentration-effect relationships (after an IV dose) have been demonstrated for a variety of pharmacodynamic measures (eg, reaction time, eye movement, sedation) and are associated with extensive intersubject variability. Logistic regression analysis of sedation scores and steady-state plasma concentration indicated that at plasma concentrations greater than 100 ng/mL there was at least a 50% probability that patients would be sedated, but respond to verbal commands (sedation score = 3). At 200 ng/mL there was at least a 50% probability that patients would be asleep, but respond to glabellar tap (sedation score = 4).

In subjects with normal kidney function, multiple intravenous dosing of 1 g of vancomycin (15 mg/kg) infused over 60 minutes produces mean plasma concentrations of approximately 63 mcg/mL immediately after the completion of infusion, mean plasma concentrations of approximately 23 mcg/mL 2 hours after infusion, and mean plasma concentrations of approximately 8 mcg/mL 11 hours after the end of the infusion. Multiple dosing of 500 mg infused over 30 minutes produces mean plasma concentrations of about 49 mcg/mL at the completion of infusion, mean plasma concentrations of about 19 mcg/mL 2 hours after infusion, and mean plasma concentrations of about 10 mcg/mL 6 hours after infusion. The plasma concentrations during multiple dosing are similar to those after a single dose. The mean elimination half-life of vancomycin from plasma is 4 to 6 hours in subjects with normal renal function. In the first 24 hours, about 75% of an administered dose of vancomycin is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration.

In anephric patients, the average half-life of elimination is 7.5 days. The distribution coefficient is from 0.3 to 0.43 L/kg. There is no apparent metabolism of the drug. About 60% of an intraperitoneal dose of vancomycin administered during peritoneal dialysis is absorbed systemically in 6 hours. Serum concentrations of about 10 mcg/mL are achieved by intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg of vancomycin. However, the safety and efficacy of the intraperitoneal use of vancomycin has not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials (see PRECAUTIONS ). Total systemic and renal clearance of vancomycin may be reduced in the elderly. Vancomycin is approximately 55% serum protein bound as measured by ultrafiltration at vancomycin serum concentrations of 10 to 100 mcg/mL. After intravenous administration of vancomycin, inhibitory concentrations are present in pleural, pericardial, ascitic, and synovial fluids; in urine; in peritoneal dialysis fluid; and in atrial appendage tissue.

Urinary Tract Infections caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. Skin and Skin-Structure Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. Septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), and Klebsiella spp. Meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Neisseria meningitidis, and Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains). Gonorrhea: Uncomplicated and disseminated gonococcal infections due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains) in both males and females. Bone and Joint Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase producing strains). Clinical microbiological studies in skin and skin-structure infections frequently reveal the growth of susceptible strains of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Cefuroxime has been used successfully in these mixed infections in which several organisms have been isolated. In certain cases of confirmed or suspected gram-positive or gram-negative sepsis or in patients with other serious infections in which the causative organism has not been identified, cefuroxime may be used concomitantly with an aminoglycoside (see PRECAUTIONS ). The recommended doses of both antibacterials may be given depending on the severity of the infection and the patient's condition. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefuroxime for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP and other antibacterial drugs, Cefuroxime for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Prevention: The preoperative prophylactic administration of Cefuroxime for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP may prevent the growth of susceptible disease-causing bacteria and thereby may reduce the incidence of certain postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures ( e.g., vaginal hysterectomy) that are classified as clean-contaminated or potentially contaminated procedures. Effective prophylactic use of antibacterials in surgery depends on the time of administration. Cefuroxime for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP should usually be given one-half to 1 hour before the operation to allow sufficient time to achieve effective antibacterial concentrations in the wound tissues during the procedure. The dose should be repeated intraoperatively if the surgical procedure is lengthy. Prophylactic administration is usually not required after the surgical procedure ends and should be stopped within 24 hours. In the majority of surgical procedures, continuing prophylactic administration of any antibacterial does not reduce the incidence of subsequent infections but will increase the possibility of adverse reactions and the development of bacterial resistance. The perioperative use of Cefuroxime for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP has also been effective during open heart surgery for surgical patients in whom infections at the operative site would present a serious risk. For these patients it is recommended that cefuroxime therapy be continued for at least 48 hours after the surgical procedure ends.

Therapeutic serum concentrations of approximately 2 mcg/mL or more were maintained for 5.3 hours and 8 hours or more, respectively. There was no evidence of accumulation of cefuroxime in the serum following IV administration of 1.5 g doses every 8 hours to normal volunteers. The serum half-life after IV injection is approximately 80 minutes. Approximately 89% of a dose of cefuroxime is excreted by the kidneys over an 8-hour period, resulting in high urinary concentrations. Intravenous doses of 750 mg and 1.5 g produced urinary levels averaging 1,150 and 2,500 mcg/mL, respectively, during the first 8-hour period. The concomitant oral administration of probenecid with cefuroxime slows tubular secretion, decreases renal clearance by approximately 40%, increases the peak serum level by approximately 30%, and increases the serum half-life by approximately 30%.

Microbiology Mechanism of Action Cefuroxime is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cefuroxime has activity in the presence of some beta-Iactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance Resistance to cefuroxime is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-Iactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In an in vitro study antagonistic effects have been observed with the combination of chloramphenicol and cefuroxime. Antimicrobial Activity Cefuroxime has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-negative bacteria Enterobacter spp. Escherichia coli Klebsiella spp. Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria meningitidis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

It is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in acetonitrile and ethanol. 11.2 Lacosamide Injection Lacosamide Injection, USP is a clear, colorless, sterile solution containing 10 mg lacosamide per mL for intravenous infusion. One 20 mL vial contains 200 mg of lacosamide drug substance. The inactive ingredients are sodium chloride (7.6 mg/mL) and water for injection. Hydrochloric acid is used for pH adjustment. Lacosamide injection has a pH of 3.8 to 5.0. Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be fully elucidated. In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data from the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. Lacosamide exposure is correlated with the reduction in seizure frequency. However, doses above 400 mg/day do not appear to confer additional benefit in group analyses. Cardiac Electrophysiology Electrocardiographic effects of lacosamide were determined in a double-blind, randomized clinical pharmacology trial of 247 healthy subjects. Chronic oral doses of 400 and 800 mg/day (equal to and two times the maximum daily recommended dose, respectively) were compared with placebo and a positive control (400 mg moxifloxacin). Lacosamide did not prolong QTc interval and did not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. Lacosamide produced a small, dose-related increase in mean PR interval. At steady-state, the time of the maximum observed mean PR interval corresponded with t max . The placebo-subtracted maximum increase in PR interval (at t max ) was 7.3 ms for the 400 mg/day group and 11.9 ms for the 800 mg/day group. For patients who participated in the controlled trials, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum increase in PR interval for a 400 mg/day lacosamide dose was 3.1 ms in patients with partial-onset seizures and 9.4 ms for patients with diabetic neuropathy. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide have been studied in healthy adult subjects (age range 18 to 87), adults with partial-onset seizures, adults with diabetic neuropathy, and subjects with renal and hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide are similar in healthy subjects, patients with partial-onset seizures, and patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass effect with a high absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. The maximum lacosamide plasma concentrations occur approximately 1 to 4 hour post-dose after oral dosing, and elimination half-life is approximately 13 hours. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice daily repeated administration. Pharmacokinetics of lacosamide are dose proportional (100 to 800 mg) and time invariant, with low inter- and intra-subject variability. Compared to lacosamide the major metabolite, O-desmethyl metabolite, has a longer T max (0.5 to 12 hours) and elimination half-life (15 to 23 hours). Absorption and Bioavailability Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration. The oral bioavailability of lacosamide tablets is approximately 100%. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption. After intravenous administration, C max is reached at the end of infusion. The 30- and 60-minute intravenous infusions are bioequivalent to the oral tablet. For the 15-minute intravenous infusion, bioequivalence was met for AUC (0-tz) but not for C max . The point estimate of C max was 20% higher than C max for oral tablet and the 90% CI for C max exceeded the upper boundary of the bioequivalence range. In a trial comparing the oral tablet with an oral solution containing 10 mg/mL lacosamide, bioequivalence between both formulations was shown. A single loading dose of 200 mg approximates steady-state concentrations comparable to the 100 mg twice daily oral administration. Distribution The volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/kg and thus close to the volume of total body water. Lacosamide is less than 15% bound to plasma proteins. Metabolism and Elimination Lacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation. After oral and intravenous administration of 100 mg [14C]-lacosamide approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces. The major compounds excreted were unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose), its O-desmethyl metabolite (approximately 30%), and a structurally unknown polar fraction (~20%). The plasma exposure of the major human metabolite, O-desmethyl-lacosamide, is approximately 10% of that of lacosamide. This metabolite has no known pharmacological activity. The CYP isoforms mainly responsible for the formation of the major metabolite (O-desmethyl) are CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours and is not altered by different doses, multiple dosing or intravenous administration. There is no enantiomeric interconversion of lacosamide. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Lacosamide and its major metabolite are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion. The AUC of lacosamide was increased approximately 25% in mildly (CL CR 50 to 80 mL/min) and moderately (CL CR 30 to 50 mL/min) and 60% in severely (CL CR \u226430 mL/min) renally impaired patients compared to subjects with normal renal function (CL CR >80 mL/min), whereas C max was unaffected. Lacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis. Following a 4-hour hemodialysis treatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50% [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) ]. Hepatic Impairment Lacosamide undergoes metabolism. Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of lacosamide (approximately 50-60% higher AUC compared to healthy subjects). The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide have not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ]. Pediatric Patients (4 Years to less than 17 Years of Age) The pediatric pharmacokinetic profile of lacosamide was determined in a population pharmacokinetic analysis using sparse plasma concentration data obtained in two open-label studies in 79 pediatric patients with partial-onset seizures that included patients 4 years to less than 17 years of age. Both apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution increase as body weight increases. For patients weighing 11 kg, 28.9 kg (the mean population body weight), and 70 kg, the typical plasma half-life (t 1/2 ) is 7.4 hours, 10.6 hours, and 14.8 hours, respectively. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice daily repeated administration. A weight based dosing regimen is necessary to achieve lacosamide exposures in pediatric patients 4 years to less than 17 years of age similar to those observed in adults treated at effective doses of lacosamide [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide in pediatric patients are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures and as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Pediatric use information is approved for UCB, Inc.'s VIMPAT \u00ae (lacosamide) injection. However, due to UCB, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Geriatric Patients In the elderly (>65 years), dose and body-weight normalized AUC and C max is about 20% increased compared to young subjects (18 to 64 years). This may be related to body weight and decreased renal function in elderly subjects. Gender Lacosamide clinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically relevant influence on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide. Race There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide between Asian, Black, and Caucasian subjects. CYP2C19 Polymorphism There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide between CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers. Results from a trial in poor metabolizers (PM) (N=4) and extensive metabolizers (EM) (N=8) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 showed that lacosamide plasma concentrations were similar in PMs and EMs, but plasma concentrations and the amount excreted into urine of the O-desmethyl metabolite were about 70% reduced in PMs compared to EMs. Drug Interactions In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In vitro metabolism studies indicate that lacosamide does not induce the enzyme activity of drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4. Lacosamide did not inhibit CYP 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5 at plasma concentrations observed in clinical studies. In vitro data suggest that lacosamide has the potential to inhibit CYP2C19 at therapeutic concentrations. However, an in vivo study with omeprazole did not show an inhibitory effect on omeprazole pharmacokinetics. Lacosamide was not a substrate or inhibitor for P-glycoprotein. Lacosamide is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have increased exposure to lacosamide. Since <15% of lacosamide is bound to plasma proteins, a clinically relevant interaction with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites is unlikely. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with AEDs \u25cb Effect of lacosamide on concomitant AEDs Lacosamide 400 mg/day had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of 600 mg/day valproic acid and 400 mg/day carbamazepine in healthy subjects. The placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients with partial-onset seizures showed that steady-state plasma concentrations of levetiracetam, carbamazepine, carbamazepine epoxide, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine monohydroxy derivative (MHD), phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, gabapentin, clonazepam, and zonisamide were not affected by concomitant intake of lacosamide at any dose. \u25cb Effect of concomitant AEDs on lacosamide Drug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects showed that 600 mg/day valproic acid had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of 400 mg/day lacosamide. Likewise, 400 mg/day carbamazepine had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide in a healthy subject study. Population pharmacokinetics results in patients with partial-onset seizures showed small reductions (15% to 20% lower) in lacosamide plasma concentrations when lacosamide was coadministered with carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin. Drug-drug interaction studies with other drugs \u25cb Digoxin There was no effect of lacosamide (400 mg/day) on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.5 mg once daily) in a study in healthy subjects. \u25cb Metformin There were no clinically relevant changes in metformin levels following coadministration of lacosamide (400 mg/day). Metformin (500 mg three times a day) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide (400 mg/day). \u25cb Omeprazole Omeprazole is a CYP2C19 substrate and inhibitor. There was no effect of lacosamide (600 mg/day) on the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole (40 mg single dose) in healthy subjects. The data indicated that lacosamide had little in vivo inhibitory or inducing effect on CYP2C19. Omeprazole at a dose of 40 mg once daily had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide (300 mg single dose). However, plasma levels of the O-desmethyl metabolite were reduced about 60% in the presence of omeprazole. \u25cb Midazolam Midazolam is a 3A4 substrate. There was no effect of lacosamide (200 mg single dose or repeat doses of 400 mg/day given as 200 mg BID) on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (single dose, 7.5 mg), indicating no inhibitory or inducing effects on CYP3A4. \u25cb Oral Contraceptives There was no influence of lacosamide (400 mg/day) on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel in healthy subjects, except that a 20% increase in ethinylestradiol C max was observed. \u25cb Warfarin Coadministration of lacosamide (400 mg/day) with warfarin (25 mg single dose) did not result in a clinically relevant change in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin in a study in healthy male subjects."], "manufacturer_name": ["Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc."], "substance_name": ["LACOSAMIDE"], "effective_time": "20241206", "product_ndc": ["70710-1359"], "brand_name": ["LACOSAMIDE"]}

Structure of Heparin Sodium"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the clotting sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. The bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophage) and b) slower first order elimination.

It acts by competing for cholinergic receptors at the motor end-plate. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine and edrophonium. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The ED95 (dose required to produce 95% suppression of the first [T1] mechanomyographic [MMG] response of the adductor pollicis muscle [thumb] to indirect supramaximal train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve) during opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia is approximately 0.3 mg/kg. Patient variability around the ED95 dose suggests that 50% of patients will exhibit T1 depression of 91% to 97%. Table 4 presents intubating conditions in patients with intubation initiated at 60 to 70 seconds. Table 4: Percent of Excellent or Good Intubating Conditions and Median (Range) Time to Completion of Intubation in Patients with Intubation Initiated at 60 to 70 Seconds * Excludes patients undergoing Cesarean section. \u2020 Pediatric patients were under halothane anesthesia. Excellent intubating conditions=jaw relaxed, vocal cords apart and immobile, no diaphragmatic movement. Good intubating conditions=same as excellent but with some diaphragmatic movement. Table 5 presents the time to onset and clinical duration for the initial dose of rocuronium bromide injection under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia in adults and geriatric patients, and under halothane anesthesia in pediatric patients. Table 5: Median (Range) Time to Onset and Clinical Duration Following Initial (Intubating) Dose During Opioid/Nitrous Oxide/Oxygen Anesthesia (Adults) and Halothane Anesthesia (Pediatric Patients) n=the number of patients who had time to maximum block recorded. Clinical duration=time until return to 25% of control T1. Patients receiving doses of 0.45 mg/kg who achieved less than 90% block (16% of these patients) had about 12 to 15 minutes to 25% recovery. Table 6 presents the time to onset and clinical duration for the initial dose of rocuronium bromide injection under sevoflurane (induction) and isoflurane/nitrous oxide (maintenance) anesthesia in pediatric patients. Table 6: Median (Range) Time to Onset and Clinical Duration Following Initial (Intubating) Dose During Sevoflurane (induction) and Isoflurane/Nitrous Oxide (maintenance) Anesthesia (Pediatric Patients) n=the number of patients with the highest number of observations for time to maximum block or reappearance T3. The time to 80% or greater block and clinical duration as a function of dose are presented in Figures 1 and 2. The clinical durations for the first 5 maintenance doses, in patients receiving 5 or more maintenance doses are represented in Figure 3 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Figure 3: Duration of Clinical Effect vs. Number of Rocuronium Bromide Maintenance Doses, by Dose Once spontaneous recovery has reached 25% of control T1, the neuromuscular block produced by rocuronium bromide is readily reversed with anticholinesterase agents, e.g., edrophonium or neostigmine. The median spontaneous recovery from 25% to 75% T1 was 13 minutes in adult patients. When neuromuscular block was reversed in 36 adults at a T1 of 22% to 27%, recovery to a T1 of 89 (50 to 132)% and T4/T1 of 69 (38 to 92)% was achieved within 5 minutes. Only 5 of 320 adults reversed received an additional dose of reversal agent. The median (range) dose of neostigmine was 0.04 (0.01 to 0.09) mg/kg and the median (range) dose of edrophonium was 0.5 (0.3 to 1.0) mg/kg. In geriatric patients (n=51) reversed with neostigmine, the median T4/T1 increased from 40% to 88% in 5 minutes. In clinical trials with halothane, pediatric patients (n=27) who received 0.5 mg/kg edrophonium had increases in the median T4/T1 from 37% at reversal to 93% after 2 minutes. Pediatric patients (n=58) who received 1 mg/kg edrophonium had increases in the median T4/T1 from 72% at reversal to 100% after 2 minutes. Infants (n=10) who were reversed with 0.03 mg/kg neostigmine recovered from 25% to 75% T1 within 4 minutes. There were no reports of less than satisfactory clinical recovery of neuromuscular function. The neuromuscular blocking action of rocuronium bromide may be enhanced in the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Hemodynamics There were no dose-related effects on the incidence of changes from baseline (30% or greater) in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) or heart rate associated with rocuronium bromide administration over the dose range of 0.12 to 1.2 mg/kg (4 \u00d7 ED95) within 5 minutes after rocuronium bromide administration and prior to intubation. Increases or decreases in MAP were observed in 2% to 5% of geriatric and other adult patients, and in about 1% of pediatric patients. Heart rate changes (30% or greater) occurred in 0% to 2% of geriatric and other adult patients. Tachycardia (30% or greater) occurred in 12 of 127 pediatric patients. Most of the pediatric patients developing tachycardia were from a single study where the patients were anesthetized with halothane and who did not receive atropine for induction [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. In U.S. studies, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation following rocuronium bromide administration were accompanied by transient tachycardia (30% or greater increases) in about one-third of adult patients under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. Animal studies have indicated that the ratio of vagal:neuromuscular block following rocuronium bromide administration is less than vecuronium but greater than pancuronium. The tachycardia observed in some patients may result from this vagal blocking activity. Histamine Release In studies of histamine release, clinically significant concentrations of plasma histamine occurred in 1 of 88 patients. Clinical signs of histamine release (flushing, rash, or bronchospasm) associated with the administration of rocuronium bromide were assessed in clinical trials and reported in 9 of 1137 (0.8%) patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adult and Geriatric Patients In an effort to maximize the information gathered in the in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, the data from the studies was used to develop population estimates of the parameters for the subpopulations represented (e.g., geriatric, pediatric, renal, and hepatic impairment). These population-based estimates and a measure of the estimate variability are contained in the following section. Following intravenous administration of rocuronium bromide, plasma levels of rocuronium follow a three-compartment open model. The rapid distribution half-life is 1 to 2 minutes and the slower distribution half-life is 14 to 18 minutes. Rocuronium is approximately 30% bound to human plasma proteins. In geriatric and other adult surgical patients undergoing either opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen or inhalational anesthesia, the observed pharmacokinetic profile was essentially unchanged [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Table 7: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults (n=22; ages 27 to 58 yrs) and Geriatric (n=20; 65 yrs or greater) During Opioid/Nitrous Oxide/Oxygen Anesthesia In general, studies with normal adult subjects did not reveal any differences in the pharmacokinetics of rocuronium due to gender. Studies of distribution, metabolism, and excretion in cats and dogs indicate that rocuronium is eliminated primarily by the liver. The rocuronium analog 17-desacetyl-rocuronium, a metabolite, has been rarely observed in the plasma or urine of humans administered single doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg with or without a subsequent infusion (for up to 12 hr) of rocuronium. In the cat, 17-desacetyl-rocuronium has approximately one-twentieth the neuromuscular blocking potency of rocuronium. The effects of renal failure and hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rocuronium in humans are consistent with these findings. In general, patients undergoing cadaver kidney transplant have a small reduction in clearance which is offset pharmacokinetically by a corresponding increase in volume, such that the net effect is an unchanged plasma half-life. Patients with demonstrated liver cirrhosis have a marked increase in their volume of distribution resulting in a plasma half-life approximately twice that of patients with normal hepatic function. Table 8 shows the pharmacokinetic parameters in subjects with either impaired renal or hepatic function. Table 8: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults with Normal Renal and Hepatic Function (n=10, ages 23 to 65), Renal Transplant Patients (n=10, ages 21 to 45), and Hepatic Dysfunction Patients (n=9, ages 31 to 67) During Isoflurane Anesthesia *Differences in the calculated t1/2\u03b2 and Cl between this study and the study in young adults vs. geriatrics (\u226565 years) is related to the different sample populations and anesthetic techniques. The net result of these findings is that subjects with renal failure have clinical durations that are similar to but somewhat more variable than the duration that one would expect in subjects with normal renal function. Hepatically impaired patients, due to the large increase in volume, may demonstrate clinical durations approaching 1.5 times that of subjects with normal hepatic function. In both populations the clinician should individualize the dose to the needs of the patient [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Tissue redistribution accounts for most (about 80%) of the initial amount of rocuronium administered. As tissue compartments fill with continued dosing (4 to 8 hours), less drug is redistributed away from the site of action and, for an infusion-only dose, the rate to maintain neuromuscular blockade falls to about 20% of the initial infusion rate. The use of a loading dose and a smaller infusion rate reduces the need for adjustment of dose. Pediatric Patients Under halothane anesthesia, the clinical duration of effects of rocuronium bromide did not vary with age in patients 4 months to 8 years of age. The terminal half-life and other pharmacokinetic parameters of rocuronium in these pediatric patients are presented in Table 9. Table 9: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Rocuronium in Pediatric Patients (ages 3 to less than 12 mos, n=6; 1 to less than 3 yrs, n=5; 3 to less than 8 yrs, n=7) During Halothane Anesthesia Pharmacokinetics of rocuronium bromide were evaluated using a population analysis of the pooled pharmacokinetic datasets from 2 trials under sevoflurane (induction) and isoflurane/nitrous oxide (maintenance) anesthesia. All pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be linearly proportional to body weight. In patients under the age of 18 years clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vss) increase with bodyweight (kg) and age (years). As a result the terminal half-life of rocuronium bromide decreases with increasing age from 1.1 hour to 0.7 to 0.8 hour. Table 10 presents the pharmacokinetic parameters in the different age groups in the studies with sevoflurane (induction) and isoflurane/nitrous oxide (maintenance) anesthesia.

It also binds with high affinity to serotonin 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , and 5-HT 2C receptors, noradrenaline \u03b1 2A , \u03b1 2B and \u03b1 1 receptors, and dopamine D 2L and D 3 receptors. The therapeutic activity of dihydroergotamine in migraine is generally attributed to the agonist effect at 5-HT 1D receptors. Two current theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT 1D receptor agonists in migraine. One theory suggests that activation of 5-HT 1D receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on arterio-venous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache. The alternative hypothesis suggests that activation of 5-HT 1D receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. In addition, dihydroergotamine possesses oxytocic properties. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Absolute bioavailability for the subcutaneous and intramuscular route have not been determined, however, no difference was observed in dihydroergotamine bioavailability from intramuscular and subcutaneous doses. Dihydroergotamine mesylate is poorly bioavailable following oral administration. Distribution Dihydroergotamine mesylate is 93% plasma protein bound. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 800 liters. Metabolism Four dihydroergotamine mesylate metabolites have been identified in human plasma following oral administration. The major metabolite, 8\u00b4-\u03b2-hydroxydihydroergotamine, exhibits affinity equivalent to its parent for adrenergic and 5-HT receptors and demonstrates equivalent potency in several venoconstrictor activity models, in vivo and in vitro . The other metabolites, (i.e., dihydrolysergic acid, dihydrolysergic amide) and a metabolite formed by oxidative opening of the proline ring are of minor importance. Following nasal administration, total metabolites represent only 20% to 30% of plasma AUC. Quantitative pharmacokinetic characterization of the four metabolites has not been performed. Excretion The major excretory route of dihydroergotamine is via the bile in the feces. The total body clearance is 1.5 L/min which reflects mainly hepatic clearance. Only 6% to 7% of unchanged dihydroergotamine is excreted in the urine after intramuscular injection. The renal clearance (0.1 L/min) is unaffected by the route of dihydroergotamine administration. The decline of plasma dihydroergotamine after intramuscular or intravenous administration is multi-exponential with a terminal half-life of about 9 hours. Subpopulations No studies have been conducted on the effect of renal or hepatic impairment, gender, race, or ethnicity on dihydroergotamine pharmacokinetics. Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection is contraindicated in patients with severely impaired hepatic or renal function. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Interactions Pharmacokinetic interactions have been reported in patients treated orally with other ergot alkaloids (e.g., increased levels of ergotamine) and macrolide antibiotics, principally troleandomycin, presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P4503A metabolism of the alkaloids by troleandomycin. Dihydroergotamine has also been shown to be an inhibitor of cytochrome P4503A catalyzed reactions and rare reports of ergotism have been obtained from patients treated with dihydroergotamine and macrolide antibiotics (e.g., troleandomycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), and in patients treated with dihydroergotamine and protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir), presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P4503A metabolism of ergotamine (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .

Daptomycin pharmacokinetics were generally linear and time-independent at daptomycin doses of 4 to 12 mg/kg every 24h administered by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for up to 14 days. Steady-state trough concentrations were achieved by the third daily dose. The mean (SD) steady-state trough concentrations attained following the administration of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg every 24h were 5.9 (1.6), 6.7 (1.6), 10.3 (5.5), 12.9 (2.9), and 13.7 (5.2) mcg/mL, respectively. Daptomycin Administered over a 2-Minute Period in Adults Following IV administration of daptomycin over a 2-minute period to healthy adult volunteers at doses of 4 mg/kg (N=8) and 6 mg/kg (N=12), the mean (SD) steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) values were 475 (71) and 701 (82) mcg\u2022h/mL, respectively. Values for maximum plasma concentration (C max ) at the end of the 2-minute period could not be determined adequately in this study. However, using pharmacokinetic parameters from 14 healthy adult volunteers who received a single dose of daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 30-minute period in a separate study, steady-state C max values were simulated for daptomycin 4 and 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 2-minute period. The simulated mean (SD) steady-state C max values were 77.7 (8.1) and 116.6 (12.2) mcg/mL, respectively. Distribution Daptomycin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin, in a concentration-independent manner. The overall mean binding ranges from 90 to 93%. In clinical studies, mean serum protein binding in adult subjects with creatinine clearance (CL CR ) \u226530 mL/min was comparable to that observed in healthy adult subjects with normal renal function. However, there was a trend toward decreasing serum protein binding among subjects with CL CR <30 mL/min (88%), including those receiving hemodialysis (86%) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (84%). The protein binding of daptomycin in adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was similar to that in healthy adult subjects. The volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) of daptomycin in healthy adult subjects was approximately 0.1 L/kg and was independent of dose. Metabolism In in vitro studies, daptomycin was not metabolized by human liver microsomes. In 5 healthy adults after infusion of radiolabeled 14 C-daptomycin, the plasma total radioactivity was similar to the concentration determined by microbiological assay. Inactive metabolites were detected in urine, as determined by the difference between total radioactive concentrations and microbiologically active concentrations. In a separate study, no metabolites were observed in plasma on Day 1 following the administration of daptomycin at 6 mg/kg to adult subjects. Minor amounts of three oxidative metabolites and one unidentified compound were detected in urine. The site of metabolism has not been identified. Excretion Daptomycin is excreted primarily by the kidneys. In a mass balance study of 5 healthy adult subjects using radiolabeled daptomycin, approximately 78% of the administered dose was recovered from urine based on total radioactivity (approximately 52% of the dose based on microbiologically active concentrations), and 5.7% of the administered dose was recovered from feces (collected for up to 9 days) based on total radioactivity. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Population-derived pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for infected adult patients (complicated skin and skin structure infections [cSSSI] and S. aureus bacteremia) and noninfected adult subjects with various degrees of renal function (Table 12). Total plasma clearance (CL T ), elimination half-life (t 1/2 ), and volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) in patients with cSSSI were similar to those in patients with S. aureus bacteremia. Following administration of daptomycin 4 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean CL T was 9%, 22%, and 46% lower among subjects and patients with mild (CL CR 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (CL CR 30 to <50 mL/min), and severe (CL CR <30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, than in those with normal renal function (CL CR >80 mL/min). The mean steady-state systemic exposure (AUC), t 1/2 , and V ss increased with decreasing renal function, although the mean AUC for patients with CL CR 30 to 80 mL/min was not markedly different from the mean AUC for patients with normal renal function. The mean AUC for patients with CL CR <30 mL/min and for patients on dialysis (CAPD and hemodialysis dosed post-dialysis) was approximately 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, than for patients with normal renal function. The mean C max ranged from 60 to 70 mcg/mL in patients with CL CR \u226530 mL/min, while the mean C max for patients with CL CR <30 mL/min ranged from 41 to 58 mcg/mL. After administration of daptomycin 6 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean C max ranged from 80 to 114 mcg/mL in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and was similar to that of patients with normal renal function.

Because renal excretion is the primary route of elimination, adjustment of daptomycin dosage interval is necessary in adult patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 10 adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and compared with those in healthy adult volunteers (N=9) matched for gender, age, and weight. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were not altered in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is warranted when daptomycin is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been evaluated. Gender No clinically significant gender-related differences in daptomycin pharmacokinetics have been observed. No dosage adjustment is warranted based on gender when daptomycin is administered. Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 12 healthy elderly subjects (\u226575 years of age) and 11 healthy young adult controls (18 to 30 years of age). Following administration of a single 4 mg/kg dose of daptomycin by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean total clearance of daptomycin was approximately 35% lower and the mean AUC 0 to \u221e was approximately 58% higher in elderly subjects than in healthy young adult subjects. There were no differences in C max [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Obese Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 6 moderately obese (Body Mass Index [BMI] 25 to 39.9 kg/m 2 ) and 6 extremely obese (BMI \u226540 kg/m 2 ) adult subjects and controls matched for age, gender, and renal function. Following administration of daptomycin by IV infusion over a 30-minute period as a single 4 mg/kg dose based on total body weight, the total plasma clearance of daptomycin normalized to total body weight was approximately 15% lower in moderately obese subjects and 23% lower in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The AUC 0 to \u221e of daptomycin was approximately 30% higher in moderately obese subjects and 31% higher in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The differences were most likely due to differences in the renal clearance of daptomycin. No adjustment of daptomycin dosage is warranted in obese patients. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric subjects was evaluated in 3 single-dose pharmacokinetic studies. In general, body weight-normalized total body clearance in pediatric patients was higher than in adults and increased with a decrease of age, whereas elimination half-life tends to decrease with a decrease of age. Body weight-normalized total body clearance and elimination half-life of daptomycin in children 2 to 6 years of age were similar at different doses. A study was conducted to assess safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric patients (1 to 17 years old, inclusive) with cSSSI caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Patients were enrolled into 4 age groups [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , and intravenous daptomycin doses of 5 to 10 mg/kg once daily were administered. Following administration of multiple doses, daptomycin exposure (AUC ss and C max,ss ) was similar across different age groups after dose adjustment based on body weight and age (Table 13). Table 13: Mean (SD) Daptomycin Population Pharmacokinetic Parameters in cSSSI Pediatric Patients Age Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg/kg) Infusion Duration (min) AUC ss (mcg\u2022h/mL) t 1/2 (h) V ss (mL) CLT (mL/h/kg) C max,ss (mcg/mL) 12 to 17 years (N=6) 5 30 434 (67.9) 7.1 (0.9) 8200 (3250) 11.8 (2.15) 76.4 (6.75) 7 to 11 years (N=2) 7 30 543* 6.8* 4470* 13.2* 92.4* 2 to 6 years (N=7) 9 60 452 (93.1) 4.6 (0.8) 2750 (832) 20.8 (4.29) 90.3 (14.0) 1 to less than 2 years (N=27) 10 60 462 (138) 4.8 (0.6) 1670 (446) 23.1 (5.43) 81.6 (20.7) AUCss, area under the concentration-time curve at steady state; CLT, clearance normalized to body weight; Vss, volume of distribution at steady state; t\u00bd, terminal half-life *Mean is calculated from N=2 A study was conducted to assess safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric patients with S. aureus bacteremia.

Following administration of multiple doses, daptomycin exposure (AUC ss and Cmax,ss ) was similar across different age groups after dose adjustment based on body weight and age (Table 14).

Simulation using a population pharmacokinetic model demonstrated that the AUCss of daptomycin in pediatric patients 1 to <2 years of age receiving 12 mg/kg once daily would be comparable to that in adult patients receiving 6 mg/kg once daily. Drug Interactions Studies In Vitro Studies In vitro studies with human hepatocytes indicate that daptomycin does not inhibit or induce the activities of the following human cytochrome P450 isoforms: 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. It is unlikely that daptomycin will inhibit or induce the metabolism of drugs metabolized by the P450 system. Aztreonam In a study in which 15 healthy adult subjects received a single dose of daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV and a combination dose of daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV and aztreonam 1 g IV, administered over a 30-minute period, the C max and AUC 0 to \u221e of daptomycin were not significantly altered by aztreonam. Tobramycin In a study in which 6 healthy adult males received a single dose of daptomycin 2 mg/kg IV, tobramycin 1 mg/kg IV, and both in combination, administered over a 30-minute period, the mean C max and AUC 0 to \u221e of daptomycin were 12.7% and 8.7% higher, respectively, when daptomycin was coadministered with tobramycin. The mean C max and AUC 0 to \u221e of tobramycin were 10.7% and 6.6% lower, respectively, when tobramycin was coadministered with daptomycin. These differences were not statistically significant. The interaction between daptomycin and tobramycin with a clinical dose of daptomycin is unknown. Warfarin In 16 healthy adult subjects, administration of daptomycin 6 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 5 days, with coadministration of a single oral dose of warfarin (25 mg) on the 5th day, had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug and did not significantly alter the INR (International Normalized Ratio). Simvastatin In 20 healthy adult subjects on a stable daily dose of simvastatin 40 mg, administration of daptomycin 4 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 14 days (N=10) had no effect on plasma trough concentrations of simvastatin and was not associated with a higher incidence of adverse events, including skeletal myopathy, than in subjects receiving placebo once daily (N=10) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid (500 mg 4 times daily) and a single dose of daptomycin 4 mg/kg by IV infusion over a 30-minute period in adults did not significantly alter the C max or AUC 0 to \u221e of daptomycin. 12.4 Microbiology Daptomycin belongs to the cyclic lipopeptide class of antibacterials. Daptomycin has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of daptomycin encompasses most clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro. This has been demonstrated both by time-kill curves and by MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. Daptomycin maintained bactericidal activity in vitro against stationary phase S. aureus in simulated endocardial vegetations. The clinical significance of this is not known. Mechanism of Action Daptomycin binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death. Resistance The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is not fully understood. Currently, there are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to daptomycin. Interactions with Other Antibacterials In vitro studies have investigated daptomycin interactions with other antibacterials. Antagonism, as determined by kill curve studies, has not been observed. In vitro synergistic interactions of daptomycin with aminoglycosides, \u03b2-lactam antibacterials, and rifampin have been shown against some isolates of staphylococci (including some methicillin-resistant isolates) and enterococci (including some vancomycin-resistant isolates). Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI in adult patients. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received daptomycin at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial. S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis and Other Post-Approval Trials in Adults In subsequent clinical trials in adult patients, non-susceptible isolates were recovered. S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a compassionate-use trial and from 7 patients in the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . An E. faecium was isolated from a patient in a vancomycin-resistant enterococci trial. Antimicrobial Activity Daptomycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )]. Gram-Positive Bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant isolates) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis Streptococcus pyogenes The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for daptomycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of daptomycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-Positive Bacteria Corynebacterium jeikeium Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-resistant isolates) Enterococcus faecium (including vancomycin-resistant isolates) Staphylococcus epidermidis (including methicillin-resistant isolates) Staphylococcus haemolyticus Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."], "manufacturer_name": ["Camber Pharmaceuticals, Inc."], "substance_name": ["DAPTOMYCIN"], "effective_time": "20230104", "product_ndc": ["31722-215"], "brand_name": ["Daptomycin"]}

Scintigraphic images obtained in humans after the intravenous administration of the drug have been comparable to those obtained with thallous chloride TI-201 in normal and abnormal myocardial tissue. Animal studies have shown that myocardial uptake is not blocked when the sodium pump mechanism is inhibited. Although studies of subcellular fractionation and electron micrographic analysis of heart cell aggregates suggest that Tc 99m Sestamibi cellular retention occurs specifically within the mitochondria as a result of electrostatic interactions, the clinical relevance of these findings has not been determined. The mechanism of Tc 99m Sestamibi localization in various types of breast tissue (e.g., benign, inflammatory, malignant, fibrous) has not been established. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pulmonary activity is negligible even immediately after injection. Blood clearance studies indicate that the fast clearing component clears with a t 1/2 of 4.3 minutes at rest, and clears with a t 1/2 of 1.6 minutes under exercise conditions. At five minutes post injection about 8 % of the injected dose remains in circulation. There is less than 1% protein binding of Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi in plasma. The myocardial biological half-life is approximately six hours after a rest or exercise injection. The biological half-life for the liver is approximately 30 minutes after a rest or exercise injection. The effective half-life of clearance (which includes both the biological half-life and radionuclide decay) for the heart is approximately 3 hours, and for the liver is approximately 30 minutes, after a rest or exercise injection. The ideal imaging time reflects the best compromise between heart count rate and surrounding organ uptake. Myocardial uptake which is coronary flow dependent is 1.2 % of the injected dose at rest and 1.5 % of the injected dose at exercise. Table 6 illustrates the biological clearance as well as effective clearance (which includes biological clearance and radionuclide decay) of Tc 99m Sestamibi from the heart and liver.

Milrinone lactate is designated chemically as 1,6-dihydro-2-methyl-6-oxo-[3,4'-bipyridine]-5-carbonitrile lactate and has the following structure: Milrinone is an off-white to tan crystalline compound with a molecular weight of 211.2 and an empirical formula of C 12 H 9 N 3 O. It is slightly soluble in methanol, and very slightly soluble in chloroform and in water. As the lactate salt, it is stable and colorless to pale yellow in solution. Milrinone lactate is available as sterile aqueous solutions of the lactate salt of milrinone for injection or infusion intravenously. Sterile, single-dose vials: Single-dose vials of 10 and 20 mL contain in each mL milrinone lactate equivalent to 1 mg milrinone and 47 mg Dextrose, Anhydrous, USP, in Water for Injection, USP. The pH is adjusted to between 3.2 and 4.0 with lactic acid or sodium hydroxide. The total concentration of lactic acid can vary between 0.95 mg/mL and 1.29 mg/mL. These vials require preparation of dilutions prior to administration to patients intravenously. structure CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Milrinone lactate is a positive inotrope and vasodilator, with little chronotropic activity different in structure and mode of action from either the digitalis glycosides or catecholamines. Milrinone lactate, at relevant inotropic and vasorelaxant concentrations, is a selective inhibitor of peak III cAMP phosphodiesterase isozyme in cardiac and vascular muscle. This inhibitory action is consistent with cAMP mediated increases in intracellular ionized calcium and contractile force in cardiac muscle, as well as with cAMP dependent contractile protein phosphorylation and relaxation in vascular muscle. Additional experimental evidence also indicates that milrinone lactate is not a beta-adrenergic agonist nor does it inhibit sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase activity as do the digitalis glycosides. Clinical studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that milrinone lactate produces dose-related and plasma drug concentration-related increases in the maximum rate of increase of left ventricular pressure. Studies in normal subjects have shown that milrinone lactate produces increases in the slope of the left ventricular pressure-dimension relationship, indicating a direct inotropic effect of the drug. Milrinone lactate also produces dose-related and plasma concentration-related increases in forearm blood flow in patients with congestive heart failure, indicating a direct arterial vasodilator activity of the drug. Both the inotropic and vasodilatory effects have been observed over the therapeutic range of plasma milrinone concentrations of 100 ng/mL to 300 ng/mL. In addition to increasing myocardial contractility, milrinone lactate improves diastolic function as evidenced by improvements in left ventricular diastolic relaxation. The acute administration of intravenous milrinone has also been evaluated in clinical trials in excess of 1600 patients, with chronic heart failure, heart failure associated with cardiac surgery, and heart failure associated with myocardial infarction.

Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce PTH levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Within two hours after administering paricalcitol injection intravenous doses ranging from 0.04 to 0.24 mcg/kg, concentrations of paricalcitol decreased rapidly; thereafter, concentrations of paricalcitol declined log-linearly. No accumulation of paricalcitol was observed with three times a week dosing. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u226599.8%). In healthy subjects, the steady state volume of distribution is approximately 23.8 L. The mean volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 5 subjects requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) is between 31 and 35 L. Elimination Metabolism After intravenous administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces and no parent drug found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation (present at low levels in plasma), as well as 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Excretion Paricalcitol is excreted primarily by hepatobiliary excretion. Approximately 63% of the radioactivity was eliminated in the feces and 19% was recovered in the urine in healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is about five to seven hours over the studied dose range of 0.04 to 0.16 mcg/kg. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has been studied in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). The mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol after administration of 0.24 mcg/kg paricalcitol IV bolus dose in CKD HD and PD patients is 13.9 and 15.4 hours, respectively (Table 5). Table 5.

The degree of accumulation was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. Specific Populations The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric and pediatric patients. Male and Female Patients The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were gender independent. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n=5) and moderate (n=5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n=10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol were similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol have been studied in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Hemodialysis procedure has essentially no effect on paricalcitol elimination. However, compared to healthy subjects, CKD patients on dialysis showed a decreased CL and increased half-life. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A at concentrations up to 50 nM (21 ng/mL) (approximately 20-fold greater than that obtained after highest tested dose). In fresh primary cultured hepatocytes, the induction observed at paricalcitol concentrations up to 50 nM was less than two-fold for CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A, where the positive controls rendered a six- to nineteen-fold induction. Hence, paricalcitol is not expected to inhibit or induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Drug interactions with paricalcitol injection have not been studied. The following studies have been performed with oral paricalcitol capsules. Omeprazole The pharmacokinetic interaction between paricalcitol capsule (16 mcg) and omeprazole (40 mg; oral), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were unaffected when omeprazole was administrated approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days, on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol capsule has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc."], "substance_name": ["PARICALCITOL"], "effective_time": "20190531", "product_ndc": ["43598-562", "43598-563", "43598-564", "43598-565"], "brand_name": ["Paricalcitol"]}

Fludeoxyglucose F-18 is transported through the cell membrane by facilitative glucose transporter proteins and is phosphorylated within the cell to [ 18 F] FDG-6-phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase. Once phosphorylated it cannot exit until it is dephosphorylated by glucose-6-phosphatase. Therefore, within a given tissue or pathophysiological process, the retention and clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F-18 reflect a balance involving glucose transporter, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities. When allowance is made for the kinetic differences between glucose and Fludeoxyglucose F-18 transport and phosphorylation (expressed as the ''lumped constant'' ratio), Fludeoxyglucose F-18 is used to assess glucose metabolism. In comparison to background activity of the specific organ or tissue type, regions of decreased or absent uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F-18 reflect the decrease or absence of glucose metabolism. Regions of increased uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F-18 reflect greater than normal rates of glucose metabolism. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Fludeoxyglucose F-18 Injection is rapidly distributed to all organs of the body after intravenous administration. After background clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F-18 Injection, optimal PET imaging is generally achieved between 30 to 40 minutes after administration. In cancer, the cells are generally characterized by enhanced glucose metabolism partially due to (1) an increase in activity of glucose transporters, (2) an increased rate of phosphorylation activity, (3) a reduction of phosphatase activity, or (4) a dynamic alteration in the balance among all these processes. However, glucose metabolism of cancer as reflected by Fludeoxyglucose F-18 accumulation shows considerable variability. Depending on tumor type, stage, and location, Fludeoxyglucose F-18 accumulation may be increased, normal, or decreased. Also, inflammatory cells can have the same variability of uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F-18. In the heart, under normal aerobic conditions, the myocardium meets the bulk of its energy requirements by oxidizing free fatty acids. Most of the exogenous glucose taken up by the myocyte is converted into glycogen. However, under ischemic conditions, the oxidation of free fatty acids decreases, exogenous glucose becomes the preferred myocardial substrate, glycolysis is stimulated, and glucose taken up by the myocyte is metabolized immediately instead of being converted into glycogen. Under these conditions, phosphorylated Fludeoxyglucose F-18 accumulates in the myocyte and can be detected with PET imaging. In the brain, cells normally rely on aerobic metabolism. In epilepsy, the glucose metabolism varies. Generally, during a seizure, glucose metabolism increases. Interictally, the seizure focus tends to be hypometabolic. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution: In four healthy male volunteers, receiving an intravenous administration of 30 seconds in duration, the arterial blood level profile for Fludeoxyglucose F-18 decayed triexponentially. The effective half-life ranges of the three phases were 0.2-0.3 minutes, 10-13 minutes with a mean and standard deviation (STD) of 11.6 (\u00b1) 1.1 min, and 80-95 minutes with a mean and STD of 88 (\u00b1) 4 min. Plasma protein binding of Fludeoxyglucose F-18 has not been studied. Metabolism: Fludeoxyglucose F-18 is transported into cells and phosphorylated to [ 18 F]-FDG-6- phosphate at a rate proportional to the rate of glucose utilization within that tissue. [F-18]-FDG-6-phosphate presumably is metabolized to 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-6-phospho-D-mannose([F-18]FDM-6-phosphate). Fludeoxyglucose F-18 Injection may contain several impurities (e.g., 2-deoxy-2-chloro-D-glucose (ClDG)). Biodistribution and metabolism of ClDG are presumed to be similar to Fludeoxyglucose F-18 and would be expected to result in intracellular formation of 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-glucose (ClDG-6-phosphate) and 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-mannose (ClDM-6-phosphate). The phosphorylated deoxyglucose compounds are dephosphorylated and the resulting compounds (FDG, FDM, ClDG, and ClDM) presumably leave cells by passive diffusion. Fludeoxyglucose F-18 and related compounds are cleared from non-cardiac tissues within 3 to 24 hours after administration. Clearance from the cardiac tissue may require more than 96 hours. Fludeoxyglucose F-18 that is not involved in glucose metabolism in any tissue is then excreted in the urine. Elimination: Fludeoxyglucose F-18 is cleared from most tissues within 24 hours and can be eliminated from the body unchanged in the urine. Three elimination phases have been identified in the reviewed literature. Within 33 minutes, a mean of 3.9% of the administrated radioactive dose was measured in the urine. The amount of radiation exposure of the urinary bladder at two hours post-administration suggests that 20.6% (mean) of the radioactive dose was present in the bladder. Special Populations: The pharmacokinetics of Fludeoxyglucose F-18 Injection have not been studied in renally-impaired, hepatically impaired or pediatric patients. Fludeoxyglucose F-18 is eliminated through the renal system. Avoid excessive radiation exposure to this organ system and adjacent tissues. The effects of fasting, varying blood sugar levels, conditions of glucose intolerance, and diabetes mellitus on Fludeoxyglucose F-18 distribution in humans have not been ascertained [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]."], "manufacturer_name": ["Cardinal Health 414, LLC"], "substance_name": ["FLUDEOXYGLUCOSE F-18"], "effective_time": "20201204", "product_ndc": ["65857-150"], "brand_name": ["Fludeoxyglucose F-18"]}

Intravenous injection of etomidate produces anesthesia characterized by a rapid onset of action, usually within one minute. Duration of anesthesia is dose dependent but relatively brief, usually three to five minutes when an average dose of 0.3 mg/kg is employed. Immediate recovery from anesthesia (as assessed by awakening time, time needed to follow simple commands and time to perform simple tests after anesthesia as well as they were performed before anesthesia), based upon data derived from short operative procedures where intravenous etomidate was used for both induction and maintenance of anesthesia, is about as rapid as, or slightly faster than, immediate recovery after similar use of thiopental. These same data revealed that the immediate recovery period will usually be shortened in adult patients by the intravenous administration of approximately 0.1 mg of intravenous fentanyl, one or two minutes before induction of anesthesia, probably because less etomidate is generally required under these circumstances (consult the package insert for fentanyl before using). The most characteristic effect of intravenous etomidate on the respiratory system is a slight elevation in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2 ) (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Reduced cortisol plasma levels have been reported with induction doses of 0.3 mg/kg etomidate. These persist for approximately 6 to 8 hours and appear to be unresponsive to ACTH administration. The intravenous administration of up to 0.6 mg/kg of etomidate to patients with severe cardiovascular disease has little or no effect on myocardial metabolism, cardiac output, peripheral circulation or pulmonary circulation. The hemodynamic effects of etomidate have in most cases been qualitatively similar to those of thiopental sodium, except that the heart rate tended to increase by a moderate amount following administration of thiopental under conditions where there was little or no change in heart rate following administration of etomidate. However, clinical data indicates that etomidate administration in geriatric patients, particularly those with hypertension, may result in decreases in heart rate, cardiac index, and mean arterial blood pressure. There are insufficient data concerning use of etomidate in patients with recent severe trauma or hypovolemia to predict cardiovascular response under such circumstances. Clinical experience and special studies to date suggest that standard doses of intravenous etomidate ordinarily neither elevate plasma histamine nor cause signs of histamine release. Limited clinical experience, as well as animal studies, suggests that inadvertent intra-arterial injection of etomidate, unlike thiobarbiturates, will not usually be followed by necrosis of tissue distal to the injection site. Intra-arterial injection of etomidate is, however, not recommended. Etomidate induction is associated with a transient 20% to 30% decrease in cerebral blood flow. This reduction in blood flow appears to be uniform in the absence of intracranial space occupying lesions. As with other intravenous induction agents, reduction in cerebral oxygen utilization is roughly proportional to the reduction in cerebral blood flow. In patients with and without intracranial space occupying lesions, etomidate induction is usually followed by a moderate lowering of intracranial pressure, lasting several minutes. All of these studies provided for avoidance of hypercapnia. Information concerning regional cerebral perfusion in patients with intracranial space occupying lesions is too limited to permit definitive conclusions. Preliminary data suggests that etomidate will usually lower intraocular pressure moderately. Etomidate is rapidly metabolized in the liver. Minimal anesthetic plasma levels of unchanged drug are equal to or higher than 0.23 mcg/mL; they decrease rapidly up to 30 minutes following injection and thereafter more slowly with a half-life value of about 75 minutes. Approximately 75% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine during the first day after injection. The chief metabolite is R-(+)-1-(1-phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylic acid, resulting from hydrolysis of etomidate, and accounts for about 80% of the urinary excretion. Limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices suggest that the volume of distribution and elimination half-life of etomidate are approximately double that seen in healthy subjects. In clinical studies, elderly patients demonstrated decreased initial distribution volumes and total clearance of etomidate. Protein binding of etomidate to serum albumin was also significantly decreased in these individuals. Reduced plasma cortisol and aldosterone levels have been reported following induction doses of etomidate.

Tromethamine Injection has been found to be primarily beneficial in correcting metabolic acidosis which may occur during or immediately following cardiac bypass surgical procedures. Correction of Acidity of ACD Blood in Cardiac Bypass Surgery. It is well known that ACD blood is acidic and becomes more acidic on storage. Tromethamine effectively corrects this acidity. Tromethamine Injection may be added directly to the blood used to prime the pump-oxygenator. When ACD blood is brought to a normal pH range the patient is spared an initial acid load. Additional tromethamine may be indicated during cardiac bypass surgery should metabolic acidosis appear. Metabolic Acidosis Associated with Cardiac Arrest. Acidosis is nearly always one of the consequences of cardiac arrest and, in some instances, may even be a causative factor in arrest. It is important therefore, that the correction of acidosis should be started promptly with other resuscitative efforts. By correcting acidosis, Tromethamine injection has caused the arrested heart to respond to resuscitative efforts after standard methods alone had failed. In these cases, tromethamine was given intraventricularly. It is to be noted, however, that such precariously ill patients often have died subsequently of causes unrelated to the administration of tromethamine.

This interaction provides a costimulatory signal necessary for full activation of T lymphocytes. Activated T lymphocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of RA, pJIA and PsA and are found in the synovium of patients with RA, pJIA and PsA. In vitro , abatacept decreases T-cell proliferation and inhibits the production of the cytokines TNF alpha (TNF\u03b1), interferon-\u03b3, and interleukin-2. In a rat collagen-induced arthritis model, abatacept suppresses inflammation, decreases anti-collagen antibody production, and reduces antigen specific production of interferon-\u03b3. The relationship of these biological response markers to the mechanisms by which ORENCIA exerts its clinical effects is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical trials with ORENCIA at doses approximating 10 mg/kg, decreases were observed in serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), interleukin-6 (IL-6), rheumatoid factor (RF), C-reactive protein (CRP), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3), and TNF\u03b1. The relationship of these biological response markers to the mechanisms by which ORENCIA exerts its clinical effects is unknown. No formal pharmacodynamic analyses of biologic response markers have been performed in patients exposed to ORENCIA as prophylaxis for aGVHD. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Healthy Adults and Adult RA - Intravenous Administration The pharmacokinetics of abatacept were studied in healthy adult subjects after a single 10 mg/kg intravenous infusion and in RA patients after multiple 10 mg/kg intravenous infusions of ORENCIA (see Table 7). Table 7: Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Mean, Range) in Healthy Subjects and RA Patients After 10 mg/kg ORENCIA Intravenous Infusion(s) PK Parameter Healthy Subjects (After 10 mg/kg Single Dose) n=13 RA Patients (After 10 mg/kg Multiple Doses a ) n=14 a Multiple intravenous infusions of ORENCIA were administered at days 1, 15, 30, and monthly thereafter. Peak Concentration (C max ) [mcg/mL] 292 (175-427) 295 (171-398) Terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) [days] 16.7 (12-23) 13.1 (8-25) Systemic clearance (CL) [mL/h/kg] 0.23 (0.16-0.30) 0.22 (0.13-0.47) Volume of distribution (Vss) [L/kg] 0.09 (0.06-0.13) 0.07 (0.02-0.13) The pharmacokinetics of abatacept in RA patients and healthy subjects appeared to be comparable. In RA patients, after multiple intravenous infusions, the pharmacokinetics of abatacept showed proportional increases of C max and AUC over the dose range of 2 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. At 10 mg/kg, serum concentration appeared to reach a steady state by day 60 with a mean (range) trough concentration of 24 mcg/mL (1 to 66 mcg/mL). No systemic accumulation of abatacept occurred upon continued repeated treatment with 10 mg/kg at monthly intervals in RA patients. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in RA patients revealed that there was a trend toward higher clearance of abatacept with increasing body weight. Age and gender (when corrected for body weight) did not affect clearance. Concomitant methotrexate, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and TNF antagonists did not influence abatacept clearance. No formal studies were conducted to examine the effects of either renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of abatacept. Adult RA - Subcutaneous Administration Abatacept exhibited linear pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous administration. The mean (range) for C min and C max at steady state observed after 85 days of treatment was 32.5 mcg/mL (6.6 to 113.8 mcg/mL) and 48.1 mcg/mL (9.8 to 132.4 mcg/mL), respectively. The bioavailability of abatacept following subcutaneous administration relative to intravenous administration was 79%. Mean estimates for systemic clearance (0.28 mL/h/kg), volume of distribution (0.11 L/kg), and terminal half-life (14.3 days) were comparable between subcutaneous and intravenous administration. Study SC-2 was conducted to determine the effect of subcutaneous monotherapy use of ORENCIA on immunogenicity (without an intravenous loading dose) in 100 RA patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] . In this study, a mean trough concentration of 12.6 mcg/mL was achieved after 2 weeks of dosing. Consistent with the intravenous data, population pharmacokinetic analyses for subcutaneous ORENCIA in RA patients revealed that there was a trend toward higher clearance of abatacept with increasing body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Age and gender (when corrected for body weight) did not affect apparent clearance. Concomitant medication, such as methotrexate, corticosteroids, and NSAIDs, did not influence abatacept apparent clearance. Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis - Intravenous Administration In Study JIA-1 among patients 6 to 17 years of age, the mean (range) steady state serum peak and trough concentrations of abatacept were 217 mcg/mL (57 to 700 mcg/mL) and 11.9 mcg/mL (0.15 to 44.6 mcg/mL) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Population pharmacokinetic analyses of the serum concentration data showed that clearance of abatacept increased with baseline body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . The estimated mean (range) clearance of abatacept in the juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients was 0.4 mL/h/kg (0.20 to 1.12 mL/h/kg). After accounting for the effect of body weight, the clearance of abatacept was not related to age and gender. Concomitant methotrexate, corticosteroids, and NSAIDs were also shown not to influence abatacept clearance. Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis - Subcutaneous Administration In Study JIA-2 among patients 2 to 17 years of age, steady state of abatacept was achieved by Day 85 following the weekly body-weight\u2013tiered subcutaneous ORENCIA dosing [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Comparable trough concentrations across weight tiers and age groups were achieved by the body-weight\u2013tiered subcutaneous dosing regimen. The mean (range) trough concentration of abatacept at Day 113 was 44.4 mcg/mL (13.4 to 88.1 mcg/mL), 46.6 mcg/mL (22.4 to 97.0 mcg/mL), and 38.5 mcg/mL (9.3 to 73.2 mcg/mL) in pediatric JIA patients weighing 10 to <25 kg, 25 to <50 kg, and \u226550 kg, respectively. Consistent with the intravenous data, population pharmacokinetic analyses for subcutaneous ORENCIA in JIA patients revealed that there was a trend toward higher clearance of abatacept with increasing body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Age and gender (when corrected for body weight) did not affect apparent clearance. Concomitant medication, such as methotrexate, corticosteroids, and NSAIDs, did not influence abatacept apparent clearance. Adult Psoriatic Arthritis - Intravenous and Subcutaneous Administration In Study PsA-I, a dose ranging study, intravenous ORENCIA was administered at 3 mg/kg, weight range-based dosing: 500 mg for patients weighing less than 60 kg, 750 mg for patients weighing 60 to 100 kg, and 1,000 mg for patients weighing greater than 100 kg, or doses of 30 mg/kg on Days 1 and 15 followed by weight-range-based dosing [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Following monthly intravenous ORENCIA administration, abatacept showed linear PK over the dose range in this study. At the weight-range-based dosing (see above), the steady state of abatacept was reached by Day 57 and the geometric mean (CV%) trough concentration (C min ) was 24.3 mcg/mL (40.8%) at Day 169. In Study PsA-II following weekly subcutaneous administration of ORENCIA at 125 mg, the steady state of abatacept was reached at Day 57 and the geometric mean (CV%) C min was 25.6 mcg/mL (47.7%) at Day 169. Consistent with the RA results, population pharmacokinetic analyses for abatacept in PsA patients revealed that there was a trend toward higher clearance (L/h) of abatacept with increasing body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In addition, relative to the RA patients with the same body weight, abatacept clearance in PsA patients was approximately 8% lower, resulting in higher abatacept exposures in patients with PsA. This slight difference in exposures, however, is not considered to be clinically meaningful.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with aGVHD demonstrated that 7 of 8 HLA-matched HSCT recipients had 29% lower clearance compared to 8 of 8 HLA-matched HSCT recipients. Consistent with previous data, increasing body weight was associated with higher clearance of abatacept, while age (when corrected for body weight) did not affect apparent clearance. Concomitant medication, such as methotrexate and calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine and tacrolimus), did not influence abatacept clearance. Based on population PK modeling and simulation with data from patients aged 6 and older, simulated exposures of abatacept following the first and last dose in pediatric subjects 2 to less than 6 years of age who received 15 mg/kg of ORENCIA via 60-minute intravenous infusion on Day -1, followed by 12 mg/kg via 60-minute intravenous infusion on Day 5, 14, and 28 are comparable to those in pediatric patients 6 to less than 17 years of age and adults patients who received 10 mg/kg via 60-minute intravenous infusion on Day -1, 5, 14, and 28."], "manufacturer_name": ["E.R.

Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1 mg bumetanide has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg furosemide. The major site of bumetanide action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The mode of action has been determined through various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. Bumetanide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as shown by marked reduction of free-water clearance (CH 2 O) during hydration and tubular free-water reabsorption (T c H 2 O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by bumetanide, and bumetanide is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic. Potassium excretion is also increased by bumetanide, in a dose-related fashion. Bumetanide may have an additional action in the proximal tubule. Since phosphate reabsorption takes place largely in the proximal tubule, phosphaturia during bumetanide-induced diuresis is indicative of this additional action. This is further supported by the reduction in the renal clearance of bumetanide by probenecid, associated with diminution in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Bumetanide does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule. Bumetanide decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid. Diuresis starts within minutes following an intravenous injection and reaches maximum levels within 15 to 30 minutes. Several pharmacokinetic studies have shown that bumetanide, administered orally or parenterally, is eliminated rapidly in humans, with a half-life of between 1 and 1 \u00bd hours. Plasma protein-binding is in the range of 94% to 96%. Oral administration of carbon-14 labeled bumetanide to human volunteers revealed that 81% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine, 45% of it as unchanged drug. Urinary and biliary metabolites identified in this study were formed by oxidation of the N-butyl side chain. Biliary excretion of bumetanide amounted to only 2% of the administered dose. Pediatric Pharmacology Elimination of bumetanide appears to be considerably slower in neonatal patients compared with adults, possibly because of immature renal and hepatobiliary function in this population. Small pharmacokinetic studies of intravenous bumetanide in preterm and full-term neonates with respiratory disorders have reported an apparent half-life of approximately 6 hours, with a range up to 15 hours and a serum clearance ranging from 0.2 to 1.1 mL/min/kg. In a population of neonates receiving bumetanide for volume overload, mean serum clearance rates were 2.17 mL/min/kg in patients less than 2 months of age and 3.8 mL/min/kg in patients aged 2 to 6 months. Mean serum half-life of bumetanide was 2.5 hours and 1.5 hours in patients aged less than 2 months and those aged 2 to 6 months, respectively. Elimination half-life decreased considerably during the first month of life, from a mean of approximately 6 hours at birth to approximately 2.4 hours at 1 month of age. In preterm neonates, mean serum concentrations following a single 0.05 mg/kg dose ranged from 126 mcg/L at 1 hour to 57 mcg/L at 8 hours. In another study, mean serum concentrations following a single 0.05 mg/kg dose were 338 ng/mL at 30 minutes and 176 ng/mL after 4 hours. A single dose of 0.1 mg/kg produced mean serum levels of 314 ng/mL at 1 hour, and 195 ng/mL at 6 hours. Mean volume of distribution in neonates and infants has been reported to range from 0.26 L/kg to 0.39 L/kg. The degree of protein binding of bumetanide in cord sera from healthy neonates was approximately 97%, suggesting the potential for bilirubin displacement. A study using pooled sera from critically ill neonates found that bumetanide at concentrations of 0.5 to 50 mcg/mL, but not 0.25 mcg/mL, caused a linear increase in unbound bilirubin concentrations. In 56 infants aged 4 days to 6 months, bumetanide doses ranging from 0.005 mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg were studied for pharmacodynamic effect. Peak bumetanide excretion rates increased linearly with increasing doses of drug. Maximal diuretic effect was observed at a bumetanide excretion rate of about 7 mcg/kg/hr, corresponding to doses of 0.035 to 0.040 mg/kg. Higher doses produced a higher bumetanide excretion rate but no increase in diuretic effect. Urine flow rate peaked during the first hour after drug administration in 80% of patients and by 3 hours in all patients. Geriatric Pharmacology In a group of ten geriatric subjects between the ages of 65 and 73 years, total bumetanide clearance was significantly lower (1.8 \u00b1 0.3 mL/min.kg) compared with younger subjects (2.9 \u00b1 0.2 mL/min.kg) after a single oral bumetanide 0.5 mg dose. Maximum plasma concentrations were higher in geriatric subjects (16.9 \u00b1 1.8 ng/mL) compared with younger subjects (10.3 \u00b1 1.5 ng/mL).

Each mL contains 25 mg Bendamustine hydrochloride, which is equivalent to 22.7 mg Bendamustine free base. Structural-Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bendamustine is a bifunctional mechlorethamine derivative containing a purine-like benzimidazole ring. Mechlorethamine and its derivatives form electrophilic alkyl groups. These groups form covalent bonds with electron-rich nucleophilic moieties, resulting in interstrand DNA crosslinks. The bifunctional covalent linkage can lead to cell death via several pathways. Bendamustine is active against both quiescent and dividing cells. The exact mechanism of action of bendamustine remains unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics analyses of data from adult NHL patients, nausea increased with increasing bendamustine C max . Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of bendamustine on the QTc interval was evaluated in 53 patients with indolent NHL and mantle cell lymphoma on Day 1 of Cycle 1 after administration of rituximab at 375 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion followed by a 30-minute intravenous infusion of bendamustine at 90 mg/m 2 /day. No mean changes greater than 20 milliseconds were detected up to one hour post infusion. The potential for delayed effects on the QT interval after one hour was not evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single IV dose of bendamustine hydrochloride C max typically occurred at the end of infusion. The dose proportionality of bendamustine has not been studied. Distribution The protein binding of bendamustine ranged from 94% to 96% and was concentration independent from 1 to 50 mcg/mL. The blood to plasma concentration ratios in human blood ranged from 0.84 to 0.86 over a concentration range of 10 to 100 mcg/mL. The mean steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of bendamustine was approximately 20 to 25 L. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 120 mg/m 2 of bendamustine over 1 hour, the intermediate half-life (t \u00bd ) of the parent compound is approximately 40 minutes. The mean terminal elimination t \u00bd of two active metabolites, \u03b3-hydroxybendamustine (M3) and N-desmethylbendamustine (M4) are approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes, respectively. Bendamustine clearance in humans is approximately 700 mL/min. Metabolism Bendamustine is extensively metabolized via hydrolytic, oxidative, and conjugative pathways. Bendamustine is primarily metabolized via hydrolysis to monohydroxy (HP1) and dihydroxy-bendamustine (HP2) metabolites with low cytotoxic activity in vitro . Two active minor metabolites, M3 and M4, are primarily formed via CYP1A2 in vitro . M3 and M4 concentrations of these metabolites in plasma are 1/10 th and 1/100 th that of the parent compound, respectively. Excretion Following IV infusion of radiolabeled bendamustine hydrochloride in cancer patients, approximately 76% of the dose was recovered. Approximately 50% of the dose was recovered in the urine (3.3% unchanged) and approximately 25% of the dose was recovered in the feces. Less than 1% of the dose was recovered in the urine as M3 and M4, and less than 5% of the dose was recovered in the urine as HP2. Specific Populations No clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine were observed based on age (31 to 84 years), sex, mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr \u2265 30 mL/min), or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1.5 < ULN and AST or ALT < 2.5 \u00d7 ULN. The effects of severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1.5-3 \u00d7 ULN and AST or ALT 2.5-10 \u00d7 ULN or total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine is unknown. Race/Ethnicity Exposures in Japanese subjects (n=6) were 40% higher than that in non-Japanese subjects receiving the same dose. The clinical importance of this difference on the safety and efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride in Japanese subjects has not been established.

Lacosamide injection, USP has a pH of 3.8 to 5.0."], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which Lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be fully elucidated. In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data from the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. Lacosamide exposure is correlated with the reduction in seizure frequency. However, doses above 400 mg/day do not appear to confer additional benefit in group analyses. Cardiac Electrophysiology Electrocardiographic effects of Lacosamide were determined in a double-blind, randomized clinical pharmacology trial of 247 healthy subjects. Chronic oral doses of 400 and 800 mg/day (equal to and two times the maximum daily recommended dose, respectively) were compared with placebo and a positive control (400 mg moxifloxacin). Lacosamide did not prolong QTc interval and did not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. Lacosamide produced a small, dose-related increase in mean PR interval. At steady-state, the time of the maximum observed mean PR interval corresponded with t max . The placebo-subtracted maximum increase in PR interval (at t max ) was 7.3 ms for the 400 mg/day group and 11.9 ms for the 800 mg/day group. For patients who participated in the controlled trials, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum increase in PR interval for a 400 mg/day Lacosamide dose was 3.1 ms in patients with partial-onset seizures and 9.4 ms for patients with diabetic neuropathy. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of Lacosamide have been studied in healthy adult subjects (age range 18 to 87), adults with partial-onset seizures, adults with diabetic neuropathy, and subjects with renal and hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of Lacosamide are similar in healthy subjects, patients with partial-onset seizures, and patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass effect with a high absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. The maximum lacosamide plasma concentrations occur approximately 1-to 4-hour post-dose after oral dosing, and elimination half-life is approximately 13 hours. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice daily repeated administration. Pharmacokinetics of Lacosamide Injection are dose proportional (100-800 mg) and time invariant, with low inter- and intra-subject variability. Compared to lacosamide the major metabolite, O-desmethyl metabolite, has a longer T max (0.5 to 12 hours) and elimination half-life (15-23 hours). Absorption and Bioavailability Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration. The oral bioavailability of Lacosamide tablets is approximately 100%. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption. After intravenous administration, C max is reached at the end of infusion. The 30- and 60-minute intravenous infusions are bioequivalent to the oral tablet. For the 15-minute intravenous infusion, bioequivalence was met for AUC (0-tz) but not for C max . The point estimate of C max was 20% higher than C max for oral tablet and the 90% CI for C max exceeded the upper boundary of the bioequivalence range. In a trial comparing the oral tablet with an oral solution containing 10 mg/mL lacosamide, bioequivalence between both formulations was shown. A single loading dose of 200 mg approximates steady-state concentrations comparable to the 100 mg twice daily oral administration. Distribution The volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/kg and thus close to the volume of total body water. Lacosamide is less than 15% bound to plasma proteins. Metabolism and Elimination Lacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation. After oral and intravenous administration of 100 mg [14C]-lacosamide approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces. The major compounds excreted were unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose), its O-desmethyl metabolite (approximately 30%), and a structurally unknown polar fraction (~20%). The plasma exposure of the major human metabolite, O-desmethyl-lacosamide, is approximately 10% of that of lacosamide. This metabolite has no known pharmacological activity. The CYP isoforms mainly responsible for the formation of the major metabolite (O-desmethyl) are CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours and is not altered by different doses, multiple dosing or intravenous administration. There is no enantiomeric interconversion of lacosamide. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Lacosamide and its major metabolite are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion. The AUC of Lacosamide was increased approximately 25% in mildly (CL CR 50-80 mL/min) and moderately (CL CR 30-50 mL/min) and 60% in severely (CL CR \u226430 mL/min) renally impaired patients compared to subjects with normal renal function (CL CR >80 mL/min), whereas C max was unaffected. Lacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis. Following a 4-hour hemodialysis treatment, AUC of Lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50% [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Hepatic Impairment Lacosamide undergoes metabolism. Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of lacosamide (approximately 50-60% higher AUC compared to healthy subjects). The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide have not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Pediatric Patients (4 to less than 17 Years of Age) The pediatric pharmacokinetic profile of lacosamide was determined in a population pharmacokinetic analysis using sparse plasma concentration data obtained in two open-label studies in 79 pediatric patients with epilepsy aged 4 years to less than 17 years. A weight based dosing regimen is necessary to achieve lacosamide exposures in pediatric patients 4 years to less than 17 years of age similar to those observed in adults treated at effective doses of lacosamide [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. For patients weighing 11 kg, 28.9 kg (the mean population body weight), and 70 kg the typical plasma half-life(t 1/2 ) is 7.4 hours, 10.6 hours, and 14.8 hours, respectively. Steady state plasama concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice daily repeated administration. The pharmacokinetics of Lacosamide in pediatric patients are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures and as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Pediatric use information is approved for UCB, Inc.'s VIMPAT \u00ae (lacosamide) injection. However, due to UCB, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Geriatric Patients In the elderly (>65 years), dose and body-weight normalized AUC and C max is about 20% increased compared to young subjects (18-64 years). This may be related to body weight and decreased renal function in elderly subjects. Gender Lacosamide clinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically relevant influence on the pharmacokinetics of Lacosamide. Race There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of Lacosamide between Asian, Black, and Caucasian subjects. CYP2C19 Polymorphism There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of Lacosamide between CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers. Results from a trial in poor metabolizers (PM) (N=4) and extensive metabolizers (EM) (N=8) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 showed that lacosamide plasma concentrations were similar in PMs and EMs, but plasma concentrations and the amount excreted into urine of the O-desmethyl metabolite were about 70% reduced in PMs compared to EMs. Drug Interactions In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In vitro metabolism studies indicate that lacosamide does not induce the enzyme activity of drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4. Lacosamide did not inhibit CYP 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5 at plasma concentrations observed in clinical studies. In vitro data suggest that lacosamide has the potential to inhibit CYP2C19 at therapeutic concentrations. However, an in vivo study with omeprazole did not show an inhibitory effect on omeprazole pharmacokinetics. Lacosamide was not a substrate or inhibitor for P-glycoprotein. Lacosamide is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have increased exposure to lacosamide. Since <15% of lacosamide is bound to plasma proteins, a clinically relevant interaction with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites is unlikely. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with AEDs Effect of Lacosamide on concomitant AEDs Lacosamide 400 mg/day had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of 600 mg/day valproic acid and 400 mg/day carbamazepine in healthy subjects. The placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients with partial-onset seizures showed that steady-state plasma concentrations of levetiracetam, carbamazepine, carbamazepine epoxide, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine monohydroxy derivative (MHD), phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, gabapentin, clonazepam, and zonisamide were not affected by concomitant intake of Lacosamide at any dose. Effect of concomitant AEDs on Lacosamide Drug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects showed that 600 mg/day valproic acid had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of 400 mg/day Lacosamide. Likewise, 400 mg/day carbamazepine had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of Lacosamide in a healthy subject study. Population pharmacokinetics results in patients with partial-onset seizures showed small reductions (15% to 20% lower) in lacosamide plasma concentrations when Lacosamide was coadministered with carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin. Drug-drug interaction studies with other drugs Digoxin There was no effect of Lacosamide (400 mg/day) on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.5 mg once daily) in a study in healthy subjects. Metformin There were no clinically relevant changes in metformin levels following coadministration of Lacosamide (400 mg/day). Metformin (500 mg three times a day) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of Lacosamide (400 mg/day). Omeprazole Omeprazole is a CYP2C19 substrate and inhibitor. There was no effect of Lacosamide (600 mg/day) on the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole (40 mg single dose) in healthy subjects. The data indicated that lacosamide had little in vivo inhibitory or inducing effect on CYP2C19. Omeprazole at a dose of 40 mg once daily had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of Lacosamide (300 mg single dose). However, plasma levels of the O-desmethyl metabolite were reduced about 60% in the presence of omeprazole. Midazolam Midazolam is a 3A4 substrate.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Voriconazole is an antifungal drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationship For Efficacy and Safety In 10 clinical trials (N=1121), the median values for the average and maximum voriconazole plasma concentrations in individual patients across these studies was 2.51 \u00b5g/mL (inter-quartile range 1.21 to 4.44 \u00b5g/mL) and 3.79 \u00b5g/mL (inter-quartile range 2.06 to 6.31 \u00b5g/mL), respectively. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of patient data from 6 of these 10 clinical trials (N=280) could not detect a positive association between mean, maximum or minimum plasma voriconazole concentration and efficacy. However, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses of the data from all 10 clinical trials identified positive associations between plasma voriconazole concentrations and rate of both liver function test abnormalities and visual disturbances [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Cardiac Electrophysiology A placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study to evaluate the effect on the QT interval of healthy male and female subjects was conducted with three single oral doses of voriconazole and ketoconazole. Serial ECGs and plasma samples were obtained at specified intervals over a 24-hour post dose observation period. The placebo-adjusted mean maximum increases in QTc from baseline after 800, 1200, and 1600 mg of voriconazole and after ketoconazole 800 mg were all <10 msec. Females exhibited a greater increase in QTc than males, although all mean changes were <10 msec. Age was not found to affect the magnitude of increase in QTc. No subject in any group had an increase in QTc of \u226560 msec from baseline. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec. However, the QT effect of voriconazole combined with drugs known to prolong the QT interval is unknown [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of voriconazole have been characterized in healthy subjects, special populations and patients. The pharmacokinetics of voriconazole are non-linear due to saturation of its metabolism. The interindividual variability of voriconazole pharmacokinetics is high. Greater than proportional increase in exposure is observed with increasing dose. It is estimated that, on average, increasing the oral dose from 200 mg every 12 hours to 300 mg every 12 hours leads to an approximately 2.5-fold increase in exposure (AUC \u03c4 ); similarly, increasing the intravenous dose from 3 mg/kg every 12 hours to 4 mg/kg every 12 hours produces an approximately 2.5-fold increase in exposure (Table 12). Table 12: Geometric Mean (%CV) Plasma Voriconazole Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults Receiving Different Dosing Regimens Note: Parameters were estimated based on non-compartmental analysis from 5 pharmacokinetic studies. AUC 12 = area under the curve over 12 hour dosing interval, C max = maximum plasma concentration, C min = minimum plasma concentration. CV = coefficient of variation. 6 mg/kg IV (loading dose) 3 mg/kg IV every 12 hours 4 mg/kg IV every 12 hours 400 mg Oral (loading dose) 200 mg Oral every 12 hours 300 mg Oral every 12 hours N 35 23 40 17 48 16 AUC 12 (\u03bcg\u2219h/mL) 13.9 (32) 13.7 (53) 33.9 (54) 9.31 (38) 12.4 (78) 34.0 (53) C max (\u03bcg/mL) 3.13 (20) 3.03 (25) 4.77 (36) 2.30 (19) 2.31 (48) 4.74 (35) C min (\u03bcg/mL) -- 0.46 (97) 1.73 (74) -- 0.46 (120) 1.63 (79) When the recommended intravenous loading dose regimen is administered to healthy subjects, plasma concentrations close to steady state are achieved within the first 24 hours of dosing (e.g., 6 mg/kg IV every 12 hours on day 1 followed by 3 mg/kg IV every 12 hours). Without the loading dose, accumulation occurs during twice daily multiple dosing with steady- state plasma voriconazole concentrations being achieved by day 6 in the majority of subjects. Absorption The pharmacokinetic properties of voriconazole are similar following administration by the intravenous and oral routes. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled data in healthy subjects (N=207), the oral bioavailability of voriconazole is estimated to be 96% (CV 13%). Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved 1\u20132 hours after dosing. When multiple doses of voriconazole are administered with high-fat meals, the mean C max and AUC \u03c4 are reduced by 34% and 24%, respectively when administered as a tablet and by 58% and 37% respectively when administered as the oral suspension [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . In healthy subjects, the absorption of voriconazole is not affected by coadministration of oral ranitidine, cimetidine, or omeprazole, drugs that are known to increase gastric pH. Distribution The volume of distribution at steady state for voriconazole is estimated to be 4.6 L/kg, suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Plasma protein binding is estimated to be 58% and was shown to be independent of plasma concentrations achieved following single and multiple oral doses of 200 mg or 300 mg (approximate range: 0.9\u201315 \u00b5g/mL). Varying degrees of hepatic and renal impairment do not affect the protein binding of voriconazole. Elimination Metabolism In vitro studies showed that voriconazole is metabolized by the human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vivo studies indicated that CYP2C19 is significantly involved in the metabolism of voriconazole. This enzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The major metabolite of voriconazole is the N-oxide, which accounts for 72% of the circulating radiolabelled metabolites in plasma. Since this metabolite has minimal antifungal activity, it does not contribute to the overall efficacy of voriconazole. Excretion Voriconazole is eliminated via hepatic metabolism with less than 2% of the dose excreted unchanged in the urine. After administration of a single radiolabelled dose of either oral or IV voriconazole, preceded by multiple oral or IV dosing, approximately 80% to 83% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine. The majority (>94%) of the total radioactivity is excreted in the first 96 hours after both oral and intravenous dosing. As a result of non-linear pharmacokinetics, the terminal half-life of voriconazole is dose dependent and therefore not useful in predicting the accumulation or elimination of voriconazole. Specific Populations Male and Female Patients In a multiple oral dose study, the mean C max and AUC \u03c4 for healthy young females were 83% and 113% higher, respectively, than in healthy young males (18\u201345 years), after tablet dosing. In the same study, no significant differences in the mean C max and AUC \u03c4 were observed between healthy elderly males and healthy elderly females (>65 years). In a similar study, after dosing with the oral suspension, the mean AUC for healthy young females was 45% higher than in healthy young males whereas the mean C max was comparable between genders. The steady state trough voriconazole concentrations (C min ) seen in females were 100% and 91% higher than in males receiving the tablet and the oral suspension, respectively. In the clinical program, no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of gender. The safety profile and plasma concentrations observed in male and female subjects were similar. Therefore, no dosage adjustment based on gender is necessary. Geriatric Patients In an oral multiple dose study the mean C max and AUC \u03c4 in healthy elderly males (\u226565 years) were 61% and 86% higher, respectively, than in young males (18\u201345 years). No significant differences in the mean C max and AUC \u03c4 were observed between healthy elderly females (\u226565 years) and healthy young females (18\u201345 years). In the clinical program, no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of age. An analysis of pharmacokinetic data obtained from 552 patients from 10 voriconazole clinical trials showed that the median voriconazole plasma concentrations in the elderly patients (>65 years) were approximately 80% to 90% higher than those in the younger patients (\u226465 years) after either IV or oral administration. However, the safety profile of voriconazole in young and elderly subjects was similar and, therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly [see Use in Special Populations (8.5) ] . Pediatric Patients The recommended doses in pediatric patients were based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data obtained from 112 immunocompromised pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years and 26 immunocompromised pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 17 years. A comparison of the pediatric and adult population pharmacokinetic data indicated that the predicted total exposure (AUC 12 ) in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years following administration of a 9 mg/kg intravenous loading dose was comparable to that in adults following a 6 mg/kg intravenous loading dose. The predicted total exposures in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years following intravenous maintenance doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg twice daily were comparable to those in adults following 3 and 4 mg/kg IV twice daily, respectively. The predicted total exposure in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years following an oral maintenance dose of 9 mg/kg (maximum of 350 mg) twice daily was comparable to that in adults following 200 mg oral twice daily. An 8 mg/kg intravenous dose will provide voriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a 9 mg/kg oral dose in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years. Voriconazole exposures in the majority of pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 17 years were comparable to those in adults receiving the same dosing regimens. However, lower voriconazole exposure was observed in some pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 17 years with low body weight compared to adults [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Limited voriconazole trough plasma samples were collected in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years with IA or invasive candidiasis including candidemia, and EC in two prospective, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter clinical studies. In eleven pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years and aged 12 to 14 years, with body weight less than 50 kg, who received 9 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours as a loading dose on the first day of treatment, followed by 8 mg/kg every 12 hours as an intravenous maintenance dose, or 9 mg/kg every 12 hours as an oral maintenance dose, the mean trough concentration of voriconazole was 3.6 mcg/mL (range 0.3 to 10.7 mcg/mL). In four pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years and aged 12 to 14 years, with body weight less than 50 kg, who received 4 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours, the mean trough concentration of voriconazole was 0.9 mcg/mL (range 0.3 to 1.6 mcg/mL) [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose (200 mg) of voriconazole in 8 patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) and 4 patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, the mean systemic exposure (AUC) was 3.2-fold higher than in age and weight matched controls with normal hepatic function. There was no difference in mean peak plasma concentrations (C max ) between the groups. When only the patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment were compared to controls, there was still a 2.3-fold increase in the mean AUC in the group with hepatic impairment compared to controls. In an oral multiple dose study, AUC \u03c4 was similar in 6 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) given a lower maintenance dose of 100 mg twice daily compared to 6 subjects with normal hepatic function given the standard 200 mg twice daily maintenance dose. The mean peak plasma concentrations (C max ) were 20% lower in the hepatically impaired group. No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In a single oral dose (200 mg) study in 24 subjects with normal renal function and mild to severe renal impairment, systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (C max ) of voriconazole were not significantly affected by renal impairment. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for oral dosing in patients with mild to severe renal impairment. In a multiple dose study of IV voriconazole (6 mg/kg IV loading dose \u00d7 2, then 3 mg/kg IV \u00d7 5.5 days) in 7 patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30\u201350 mL/min), the systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (C max ) were not significantly different from those in 6 subjects with normal renal function. However, in patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30\u201350 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. The mean systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of SBECD were increased 4-fold and almost 50%, respectively, in the moderately impaired group compared to the normal control group. A pharmacokinetic study in subjects with renal failure undergoing hemodialysis showed that voriconazole is dialyzed with clearance of 121 mL/min. The intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is hemodialyzed with clearance of 55 mL/min. A 4-hour hemodialysis session does not remove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Patients at Risk of Aspergillosis The observed voriconazole pharmacokinetics in patients at risk of aspergillosis (mainly patients with malignant neoplasms of lymphatic or hematopoietic tissue) were similar to healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Effects of Other Drugs on Voriconazole Voriconazole is metabolized by the human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Results of in vitro metabolism studies indicate that the affinity of voriconazole is highest for CYP2C19, followed by CYP2C9, and is appreciably lower for CYP3A4. Inhibitors or inducers of these three enzymes may increase or decrease voriconazole systemic exposure (plasma concentrations), respectively. The systemic exposure to voriconazole is significantly reduced by the concomitant administration of the following agents and their use is contraindicated: Rifampin (potent CYP450 inducer) \u2013Rifampin (600 mg once daily) decreased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of voriconazole (200 mg every 12 hours \u00d7 7 days) by an average of 93% and 96%, respectively, in healthy subjects. Doubling the dose of voriconazole to 400 mg every 12 hours does not restore adequate exposure to voriconazole during coadministration with rifampin [see Contraindications (4) ] . Ritonavir (potent CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate) \u2013The effect of the coadministration of voriconazole and ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg) was investigated in two separate studies. High-dose ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours for 9 days) decreased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 8 days) by an average of 66% and 82%, respectively, in healthy subjects. Low-dose ritonavir (100 mg every 12 hours for 9 days) decreased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 8 days) by an average of 24% and 39%, respectively , in healthy subjects. Although repeat oral administration of voriconazole did not have a significant effect on steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of high-dose ritonavir in healthy subjects, steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of low-dose ritonavir decreased slightly by 24% and 14% respectively, when administered concomitantly with oral voriconazole in healthy subjects [see Contraindications (4) ] . St. John's Wort (CYP450 inducer; P-gp inducer) \u2013In an independent published study in healthy volunteers who were given multiple oral doses of St. John's Wort (300 mg LI 160 extract three times daily for 15 days) followed by a single 400 mg oral dose of voriconazole, a 59% decrease in mean voriconazole AUC 0\u2013\u221e was observed. In contrast, coadministration of single oral doses of St. John's Wort and voriconazole had no appreciable effect on voriconazole AUC 0\u2013\u221e . Long-term use of St. John's Wort could lead to reduced voriconazole exposure [see Contraindications (4) ] . Significant drug interactions that may require voriconazole dosage adjustment, or frequent monitoring of voriconazole-related adverse reactions/toxicity: Fluconazole (CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor): Concurrent administration of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 2.5 days) and oral fluconazole (400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg every 24 hours for 4 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in an increase in C max and AUC \u03c4 of voriconazole by an average of 57% (90% CI: 20%, 107%) and 79% (90% CI: 40%, 128%), respectively. In a follow-on clinical study involving 8 healthy male subjects, reduced dosing and/or frequency of voriconazole and fluconazole did not eliminate or diminish this effect [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Letermovir (CYP2C9/2C19 inducer) \u2013Coadministration of oral letermovir with oral voriconazole decreased the steady state C max and AUC 0\u201312 of voriconazole by an average of 39% and 44%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Minor or no significant pharmacokinetic interactions that do not require dosage adjustment: Cimetidine (non-specific CYP450 inhibitor and increases gastric pH) \u2013Cimetidine (400 mg every 12 hours \u00d7 8 days) increased voriconazole steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 by an average of 18% (90% CI: 6%, 32%) and 23% (90% CI: 13%, 33%), respectively, following oral doses of 200 mg every 12 hours \u00d7 7 days to healthy subjects. Ranitidine (increases gastric pH) \u2013Ranitidine (150 mg every 12 hours) had no significant effect on voriconazole C max and AUC \u03c4 following oral doses of 200 mg every 12 hours \u00d7 7 days to healthy subjects. Macrolide antibiotics \u2013Coadministration of erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitor; 1 gram every 12 hours for 7 days) or azithromycin (500 mg every 24 hours for 3 days) with voriconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 14 days had no significant effect on voriconazole steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 in healthy subjects. The effects of voriconazole on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or azithromycin are not known. Effects of Voriconazole on Other Drugs In vitro studies with human hepatic microsomes show that voriconazole inhibits the metabolic activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. In these studies, the inhibition potency of voriconazole for CYP3A4 metabolic activity was significantly less than that of two other azoles, ketoconazole and itraconazole. In vitro studies also show that the major metabolite of voriconazole, voriconazole N-oxide, inhibits the metabolic activity of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to a greater extent than that of CYP2C19. Therefore, there is potential for voriconazole and its major metabolite to increase the systemic exposure (plasma concentrations) of other drugs metabolized by these CYP450 enzymes. The systemic exposure of the following drug is significantly increased by coadministration of voriconazole and their use is contraindicated: Sirolimus (CYP3A4 substrate) \u2013Repeat dose administration of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 8 days) increased the C max and AUC of sirolimus (2 mg single dose) an average of 7-fold (90% CI: 5.7, 7.5) and 11-fold (90% CI: 9.9, 12.6), respectively, in healthy male subjects [see Contraindications (4) ] . Coadministration of voriconazole with the following agents results in increased exposure to these drugs. Therefore, careful monitoring and/or dosage adjustment of these drugs is needed: Alfentanil (CYP3A4 substrate) \u2013Coadministration of multiple doses of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on day 1, 200 mg every 12 hours on day 2) with a single 20 mcg/kg intravenous dose of alfentanil with concomitant naloxone resulted in a 6-fold increase in mean alfentanil AUC 0\u2013\u221e and a 4-fold prolongation of mean alfentanil elimination half-life, compared to when alfentanil was given alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Fentanyl (CYP3A4 substrate): In an independent published study, concomitant use of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, then 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2) with a single intravenous dose of fentanyl (5 \u00b5g/kg) resulted in an increase in the mean AUC 0\u2013\u221e of fentanyl by 1.4-fold (range 0.81- to 2.04-fold) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Oxycodone (CYP3A4 substrate): In an independent published study, coadministration of multiple doses of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours, on Day 1 followed by five doses of 200 mg every 12 hours on Days 2 to 4) with a single 10 mg oral dose of oxycodone on Day 3 resulted in an increase in the mean C max and AUC 0\u2013\u221e of oxycodone by 1.7-fold (range 1.4- to 2.2-fold) and 3.6-fold (range 2.7- to 5.6-fold), respectively.

Two-Way Interactions Concomitant use of the following agents with voriconazole is contraindicated: Rifabutin (potent CYP450 inducer) \u2013Rifabutin (300 mg once daily) decreased the C max and AUC \u03c4 of voriconazole at 200 mg twice daily by an average of 67% (90% CI: 58%, 73%) and 79% (90% CI: 71%, 84%), respectively, in healthy subjects. During coadministration with rifabutin (300 mg once daily), the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of voriconazole following an increased dose of 400 mg twice daily were on average approximately 2 times higher, compared with voriconazole alone at 200 mg twice daily. Coadministration of voriconazole at 400 mg twice daily with rifabutin 300 mg twice daily increased the C max and AUC \u03c4 of rifabutin by an average of 3-times (90% CI: 2.2, 4.0) and 4 times (90% CI: 3.5, 5.4), respectively, compared to rifabutin given alone [see Contraindications (4) ] . Significant drug interactions that may require dosage adjustment, frequent monitoring of drug levels and/or frequent monitoring of drug-related adverse reactions/toxicity: Efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate) \u2013Standard doses of voriconazole and efavirenz (400 mg every 24 hours or higher) must not be coadministered [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Steady state efavirenz (400 mg PO every 24 hours) decreased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of voriconazole (400 mg PO every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg PO every 12 hours for 8 days) by an average of 61% and 77%, respectively, in healthy male subjects. Voriconazole at steady state (400 mg PO every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 8 days) increased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of efavirenz (400 mg PO every 24 hours for 9 days) by an average of 38% and 44%, respectively, in healthy subjects.

Coadministration of voriconazole 400 mg every 12 hours with efavirenz 300 mg every 24 hours, decreased voriconazole AUC \u03c4 by 7% (90% CI: -23%, 13%) and increased C max by 23% (90% CI: -1%, 53%); efavirenz AUC \u03c4 was increased by 17% (90% CI: 6%, 29%) and C max was equivalent [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Contraindications (4) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Phenytoin (CYP2C9 substrate and potent CYP450 inducer) \u2013Repeat dose administration of phenytoin (300 mg once daily) decreased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of orally administered voriconazole (200 mg every 12 hours \u00d7 14 days) by an average of 50% and 70%, respectively, in healthy subjects. Administration of a higher voriconazole dose (400 mg every 12 hours \u00d7 7 days) with phenytoin (300 mg once daily) resulted in comparable steady state voriconazole C max and AUC \u03c4 estimates as compared to when voriconazole was given at 200 mg every 12 hours without phenytoin [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Repeat dose administration of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours \u00d7 10 days) increased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of phenytoin (300 mg once daily) by an average of 70% and 80%, respectively, in healthy subjects. The increase in phenytoin C max and AUC when coadministered with voriconazole may be expected to be as high as 2 times the C max and AUC estimates when phenytoin is given without voriconazole [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .

No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was seen and no dosage adjustment of these drugs is recommended: Indinavir (CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate) \u2013Repeat dose administration of indinavir (800 mg TID for 10 days) had no significant effect on voriconazole C max and AUC following repeat dose administration (200 mg every 12 hours for 17 days) in healthy subjects. Repeat dose administration of voriconazole (200 mg every 12 hours for 7 days) did not have a significant effect on steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of indinavir following repeat dose administration (800 mg TID for 7 days) in healthy subjects. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Voriconazole is an azole antifungal drug. The primary mode of action of voriconazole is the inhibition of fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylation, an essential step in fungal ergosterol biosynthesis. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of voriconazole. Resistance A potential for development of resistance to voriconazole is well known. The mechanisms of resistance may include mutations in the gene ERG11 (encodes for the target enzyme, lanosterol 14-\u03b1-demethylase), upregulation of genes encoding the ATP-binding cassette efflux transporters i.e., Candida drug resistance (CDR) pumps and reduced access of the drug to the target, or some combination of those mechanisms. The frequency of drug resistance development for the various fungi for which this drug is indicated is not known. Fungal isolates exhibiting reduced susceptibility to fluconazole or itraconazole may also show reduced susceptibility to voriconazole, suggesting cross-resistance can occur among these azoles. The relevance of cross-resistance and clinical outcome has not been fully characterized. Clinical cases where azole cross-resistance is demonstrated may require alternative antifungal therapy. Antimicrobial Activity Voriconazole has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections. Aspergillus fumigatus Aspergillus flavus Aspergillus niger Aspergillus terreus Candida albicans Candida glabrata (In clinical studies, the voriconazole MIC 90 was 4 \u00b5g/mL) In clinical studies, voriconazole MIC 90 for C. glabrata baseline isolates was 4 \u00b5g/mL; 13/50 (26%) C. glabrata baseline isolates were resistant (MIC \u22654 \u00b5g/mL) to voriconazole. However, based on 1054 isolates tested in surveillance studies the MIC 90 was 1 \u00b5g/mL. Candida krusei Candida parapsilosis Candida tropicalis Fusarium spp. including Fusarium solani Scedosporium apiospermum The following data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following fungi exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for voriconazole against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the effectiveness of voriconazole in treating clinical infections due to these fungi has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials: Candida lusitaniae Candida guilliermondii Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C19, significantly involved in the metabolism of voriconazole, exhibits genetic polymorphism. Approximately 15\u201320% of Asian populations may be expected to be poor metabolizers. For Caucasians and Blacks, the prevalence of poor metabolizers is 3\u20135%. Studies conducted in Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects have shown that poor metabolizers have, on average, 4-fold higher voriconazole exposure (AUC \u03c4 ) than their homozygous extensive metabolizer counterparts. Subjects who are heterozygous extensive metabolizers have, on average, 2-fold higher voriconazole exposure than their homozygous extensive metabolizer counterparts [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Roerig"], "substance_name": ["VORICONAZOLE"], "effective_time": "20250328", "product_ndc": ["0049-4190"], "brand_name": ["VFEND"]}

It is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system, especially in the nigrostriatal tract, and in a few peripheral sympathetic nerves. Dopamine elicits its pharmacological action by activating dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, beta-1 receptors and alpha-1 receptors. The activation of different receptors leading to its effects are dependent on dopamine dose. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Dopamine's onset of action occurs within five minutes of intravenous administration and the duration of action is less than about ten minutes. Dopamine effects are dosage-dependent. \u2022 At <5 mcg/kg/minute, dopamine HCl activates dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the renal, mesenteric, and coronary vasculature causing vasodilation. \u2022 At 5 to 10 mcg/kg/minute, dopamine HCl activates beta-1 receptors enhancing heart rate and contractility. \u2022 At >10 mcg/kg/minute, dopamine HCl activates alpha-1 receptors causing vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Following intravenous administration, dopamine is widely distributed in the body but does not cross the blood-brain barrier to a significant extent. Elimination The half-life of dopamine in adults is less than 2 minutes.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and levothyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Levothyroxine sodium is a synthetic T4 hormone that exerts the same physiologic effect as endogenous T4, thereby maintaining normal T4 levels when a deficiency is present. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBA), whose capacities and affinities vary for each hormone. The higher affinity of both TBG and TBPA for T4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic clearance, and longer half life of T4 compared to T3. Protein bound thyroid hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone. Only unbound hormone is metabolically active. Many drugs and physiologic conditions affect the binding of thyroid hormones to serum proteins [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Metabolism T4 is slowly eliminated. The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately eighty percent of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3, with T4 deiodination also occurring at a number of additional sites, including the kidney and other tissues. Approximately 80% of the daily dose of T4 is deiodinated to yield equal amounts of T3 and reverse T3 (rT3). T3 and rT3 are further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys.

Pressor effects by direct alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor activation are mediated by increases in arterial pressures, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance. Indirect adrenergic stimulation is caused by norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Ephedrine stimulates heart rate and cardiac output and variably increases peripheral resistance; as a result, ephedrine usually increases blood pressure. Stimulation of the \u03b1-adrenergic receptors of smooth muscle cells in the bladder base may increase the resistance to the outflow of urine. Activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs promotes bronchodilation. The overall cardiovascular effect from ephedrine is the result of a balance among \u03b1-1 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction, \u03b2-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction, and \u03b2-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation.

Distribution Plasma concentrations of caspofungin decline in a polyphasic manner following single 1-hour IV infusions. A short \u03b1-phase occurs immediately postinfusion, followed by a \u03b2-phase (half-life of 9 to 11 hours) that characterizes much of the profile and exhibits clear log-linear behavior from 6 to 48 hours postdose during which the plasma concentration decreases 10-fold. An additional, longer half-life phase, \u03b3-phase, (half-life of 40 to 50 hours), also occurs. Distribution, rather than excretion or biotransformation, is the dominant mechanism influencing plasma clearance. Caspofungin is extensively bound to albumin (~97%), and distribution into red blood cells is minimal. Mass balance results showed that approximately 92% of the administered radioactivity was distributed to tissues by 36 to 48 hours after a single 70 mg dose of [ 3 H] caspofungin acetate. There is little excretion or biotransformation of caspofungin during the first 30 hours after administration. Metabolism Caspofungin is slowly metabolized by hydrolysis and N-acetylation. Caspofungin also undergoes spontaneous chemical degradation to an open-ring peptide compound, L-747969. At later time points (\u22655 days postdose), there is a low level (\u22647 picomoles/mg protein, or \u22641.3% of administered dose) of covalent binding of radiolabel in plasma following single-dose administration of [ 3 H] caspofungin acetate, which may be due to two reactive intermediates formed during the chemical degradation of caspofungin to L-747969. Additional metabolism involves hydrolysis into constitutive amino acids and their degradates, including dihydroxyhomotyrosine and N-acetyl-dihydroxyhomotyrosine. These two tyrosine derivatives are found only in urine, suggesting rapid clearance of these derivatives by the kidneys. Excretion Two single-dose radiolabeled pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. In one study, plasma, urine, and feces were collected over 27 days, and in the second study plasma was collected over 6 months. Plasma concentrations of radioactivity and of caspofungin were similar during the first 24 to 48 hours postdose; thereafter drug levels fell more rapidly. In plasma, caspofungin concentrations fell below the limit of quantitation after 6 to 8 days postdose, while radiolabel fell below the limit of quantitation at 22.3 weeks postdose. After single intravenous administration of [ 3 H] caspofungin acetate, excretion of caspofungin and its metabolites in humans was 35% of dose in feces and 41% of dose in urine. A small amount of caspofungin is excreted unchanged in urine (~1.4% of dose). Renal clearance of parent drug is low (~0.15 mL/min) and total clearance of caspofungin is 12 mL/min. Special Populations Renal Impairment In a clinical study of single 70 mg doses, caspofungin pharmacokinetics were similar in healthy adult volunteers with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) and control subjects. Moderate (creatinine clearance 31 to 49 mL/min), severe (creatinine clearance 5 to 30 mL/min), and end-stage (creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min and dialysis dependent) renal impairment moderately increased caspofungin plasma concentrations after single-dose administration (range: 30 to 49% for AUC). However, in adult patients with invasive aspergillosis, candidemia, or other Candida infections (intra-abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, or pleural space infections) who received multiple daily doses of caspofungin 50 mg, there was no significant effect of mild to end-stage renal impairment on caspofungin concentrations. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. Caspofungin is not dialyzable, thus supplementary dosing is not required following hemodialysis. Hepatic Impairment Plasma concentrations of caspofungin after a single 70 mg dose in adult patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6) were increased by approximately 55% in AUC compared to healthy control subjects. In a 14-day multiple-dose study (70 mg on Day 1 followed by 50 mg daily thereafter), plasma concentrations in adult patients with mild hepatic impairment were increased modestly (19 to 25% in AUC) on Days 7 and 14 relative to healthy control subjects. No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) who received a single 70 mg dose of caspofungin had an average plasma caspofungin increase of 76% in AUC compared to control subjects. A dosage reduction is recommended for adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment based upon these pharmacokinetic data [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. There is no clinical experience in adult patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9) or in pediatric patients with any degree of hepatic impairment. Gender Plasma concentrations of caspofungin in healthy adult men and women were similar following a single 70 mg dose. After 13 daily 50 mg doses, caspofungin plasma concentrations in women were elevated slightly (approximately 22% in area under the curve [AUC]) relative to men. No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender. Race Regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data indicated that no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin were seen among Caucasians, Blacks, and Hispanics. No dosage adjustment is necessary on the basis of race. Geriatric Patients Plasma concentrations of caspofungin in healthy older men and women (65 years of age and older) were increased slightly (approximately 28% AUC) compared to young healthy men after a single 70 mg dose of caspofungin. In patients who were treated empirically or who had candidemia or other Candida infections (intra-abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, or pleural space infections), a similar modest effect of age was seen in older patients relative to younger patients. No dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Pediatric Patients Caspofungin has been studied in five prospective studies involving pediatric patients under 18 years of age, including three pediatric pharmacokinetic studies [initial study in adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) and children (2 to 11 years of age) followed by a study in younger patients (3 to 23 months of age) and then followed by a study in neonates and infants (less than 3 months of age)] [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )].

Caspofungin is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein and is a poor substrate for CYP enzymes. In clinical studies, caspofungin did not induce the CYP3A4 metabolism of other drugs. Clinical studies in adult healthy volunteers also demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin are not altered by itraconazole, amphotericin B, mycophenolate, nelfinavir, or tacrolimus. Caspofungin has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole, amphotericin B, or the active metabolite of mycophenolate. Cyclosporine : In two adult clinical studies, cyclosporine (one 4 mg/kg dose or two 3 mg/kg doses) increased the AUC of caspofungin by approximately 35%. Caspofungin did not increase the plasma levels of cyclosporine. There were transient increases in liver ALT and AST when caspofungin and cyclosporine were co-administered [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Tacrolimus : Caspofungin reduced the blood AUC 0-12 of tacrolimus (FK-506, Prograf \u00ae ) by approximately 20%, peak blood concentration (C max ) by 16%, and 12-hour blood concentration (C 12hr ) by 26% in healthy adult subjects when tacrolimus (2 doses of 0.1 mg/kg 12 hours apart) was administered on the 10th day of caspofungin 70 mg daily, as compared to results from a control period in which tacrolimus was administered alone. For patients receiving both therapies, standard monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations and appropriate tacrolimus dosage adjustments are recommended. Rifampin : A drug-drug interaction study with rifampin in adult healthy volunteers has shown a 30% decrease in caspofungin trough concentrations [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Other Inducers of Hepatic CYP Enzymes Adults : Results from regression analyses of adult patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other hepatic CYP enzyme inducers (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine) with caspofungin may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations. It is not known which drug clearance mechanism involved in caspofungin disposition may be inducible [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Pediatric patients: In pediatric patients, results from regression analyses of pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of dexamethasone with caspofungin may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin trough concentrations. This finding may indicate that pediatric patients will have similar reductions with inducers as seen in adults [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Caspofungin, an echinocandin, inhibits the synthesis of beta (1,3)-D-glucan, an essential component of the cell wall of susceptible Aspergillus species and Candida species. Beta (1,3)-D-glucan is not present in mammalian cells. Caspofungin has shown activity against Candida species and in regions of active cell growth of the hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus . Resistance There have been reports of clinical failures in patients receiving caspofungin therapy due to the development of drug resistant Candida or Aspergillus species. Some of these reports have identified specific mutations in the Fks subunits, encoded by the fks 1 and/or fks 2 genes, of the glucan synthase enzyme. These mutations are associated with higher MICs and breakthrough infection. Candida species that exhibit reduced susceptibility to caspofungin as a result of an increase in the chitin content of the fungal cell wall have also been identified, although the significance of this phenomenon in vivo is not well known. Interaction With Other Antimicrobials Studies in vitro and in vivo of caspofungin, in combination with amphotericin B, suggest no antagonism of antifungal activity against either A. fumigatus or C. albicans . The clinical significance of these results is unknown. Antimicrobial Activity Caspofungin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] : Aspergillus flavus Aspergillus fumigatus Aspergillus terreus Candida albicans Candida glabrata Candida guilliermondii Candida krusei Candida parapsilosis Candida tropicalis Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for caspofungin, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Sagent Pharmaceuticals"], "substance_name": ["CASPOFUNGIN ACETATE"], "effective_time": "20230502", "product_ndc": ["25021-194", "25021-195"], "brand_name": ["Caspofungin Acetate"]}

Formula1.jpg Image1.jpg"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["Clinical Pharmacology Mechanism of Action and Electrophysiology: Studies of the effects of therapeutic concentrations of lidocaine on the electrophysiological properties of mammalian Purkinje fibers have shown that lidocaine attenuates phase 4 diastolic depolarization, decreases automaticity and causes a decrease or no change in excitability and membrane responsiveness. Action potential duration and effective refractory period of Purkinje fibers are decreased while the ratio of effective refractory period to action potential duration is increased. Action potential duration and effective refractory period of ventricular muscle are also decreased. Effective refractory period of the AV node may increase, decrease or remain unchanged and atrial effective refractory period is unchanged. Lidocaine raises the ventricular fibrillation threshold. No significant interactions between lidocaine and the autonomic nervous system have been described and consequently lidocaine has little or no effect on autonomic tone. Clinical electrophysiological studies with lidocaine have demonstrated no change in sinus node recovery time or sinoatrial conduction time. AV nodal conduction time is unchanged or shortened and His-Purkinje conduction time is unchanged. Hemodynamics: At therapeutic doses, lidocaine has minimal hemodynamic effects in normal subjects and in patients with heart disease. Lidocaine has been shown to cause no, or minimal decrease in ventricular contractility, cardiac output, arterial pressure or heart rate. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Lidocaine is rapidly metabolized by the liver and less than 10% of a dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Oxidative Ndealkylation, a major pathway of metabolism, results in the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological activities of these metabolites are similar to but less potent than lidocaine. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. There are data that indicate that the half-life may be 3 hours or longer following infusions of greater than 24 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that alters liver function, including changes in liver blood flow, which could result from severe congestive heart failure or shock may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be twofold or more greater in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics, but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Therapeutic effects of lidocaine are generally associated with plasma levels of 6 to 25 mmole/L (1.5 to 6 mg free base per mL). The blood to plasma distribution ratio is approximately 0.84. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing plasma levels above 6 mg free base per mL. The plasma protein binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mg free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. In addition to lidocaine concentration, the binding is dependent on the plasma concentration of the a-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine readily crosses the placental and blood-brain barriers.

Doxorubicin consists of a naphthacenequinone nucleus linked through a glycosidic bond at ring atom 7 to an amino sugar, daunosamine. Chemically, doxorubicin hydrochloride is (8S,10S)-10-[(3-Amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-a-L-lyxo-hexopyranosyl)-oxy]-8-glycoloyl-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro- 6,8,11-trihydroxy-1-methoxy-5,12-naphthacenedione hydrochloride. The structural formula is as follows: Doxorubicin binds to nucleic acids, presumably by specific intercalation of the planar anthracycline nucleus with the DNA double helix. The anthracycline ring is lipophilic, but the saturated end of the ring system contains abundant hydroxyl groups adjacent to the amino sugar, producing a hydrophilic center. The molecule is amphoteric, containing acidic functions in the ring phenolic groups and a basic function in the sugar amino group. It binds to cell membranes as well as plasma proteins. It is supplied in the hydrochloride form as a sterile red-orange lyophilized powder containing lactose and as a sterile parenteral, isotonic solution with sodium chloride for intravenous use only.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin on malignant cells and its toxic effects on various organs are thought to be related to nucleotide base intercalation and cell membrane lipid binding activities of doxorubicin. Intercalation inhibits nucleotide replication and action of DNA and RNA polymerases. The interaction of doxorubicin with topoisomerase II to form DNA-cleavable complexes appears to be an important mechanism of doxorubicin cytocidal activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies conducted in patients with various types of tumors have shown that doxorubicin follows multiphasic disposition after intravenous injection. The distribution half-life is approximately 5 minutes, while the terminal half-life is 20 to 48 hours. In four patients, doxorubicin demonstrated dose-independent pharmacokinetics across a dose range of 30 to 70 mg/m 2 . Distribution Steady-state distribution volume ranges from 809 to 1214 L/m 2 . Binding of doxorubicin and its major metabolite, doxorubicinol, to plasma proteins is about 75% and is independent of plasma concentration of doxorubicin up to 1.1 mcg/mL. Doxorubicin was measured in the milk of one lactating patient after therapy with 70 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. The peak milk concentration at 24 hours after treatment was 4.4-fold greater than the corresponding plasma concentration. Doxorubicin was detectable in the milk up to 72 hours. Doxorubicin does not cross the blood brain barrier. Metabolism Enzymatic reduction at the 7 position and cleavage of the daunosamine sugar yields aglycones which are accompanied by free radical formation, the local production of which may contribute to the cardiotoxic activity of doxorubicin. Disposition of doxorubicinol in patients is formation rate limited, with the terminal half-life of doxorubicinol being similar to doxorubicin. The relative exposure of doxorubicinol, i.e., the ratio between the AUC of doxorubicinol and the AUC of doxorubicin is approximately 0.5. Excretion Plasma clearance is in the range 324 to 809 mL/min/m 2 and is predominately by metabolism and biliary excretion. Approximately 40% of the dose appears in the bile in 5 days, while only 5 to 12% of the drug and its metabolites appear in the urine during the same time period. In urine, <3% of the dose was recovered as doxorubicinol over 7 days. Systemic clearance of doxorubicin is significantly reduced in obese women with ideal body weight greater than 130%. There was a significant reduction in clearance without any change in volume of distribution in obese patients when compared with normal patients with less than 115% ideal body weight. Pediatric patients Following administration of doses ranging from 10 to 75 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin to 60 children and adolescents ranging from 2 months to 20 years of age, doxorubicin clearance averaged 1443 \u00b1 114 mL/min/m 2 . Further analysis demonstrated that clearance in 52 children greater than 2 years of age (1540 mL/min/m 2 ) was increased compared with adults. However, clearance in infants younger than 2 years of age (813 mL/min/m 2 ) was decreased compared with older children and approached the range of clearance values determined in adults [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Patient Gender There is no recommended dose adjustment based on gender. A published clinical study involving 6 men and 21 women with no prior anthracycline therapy reported a significantly higher median doxorubicin clearance in men compared to women (1088 mL/min/m 2 versus 433 mL/min/m 2 ). However, the terminal half-life of doxorubicin was longer in men compared to women (54 versus 35 hours). Patients with hepatic impairment The clearance of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol was reduced in patients with elevation in serum bilirubin [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc."], "substance_name": ["DOXORUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240411", "product_ndc": ["0143-9275", "0143-9277"], "brand_name": ["Adriamycin"]}

The mean area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) for nafcillin in this study was 18.06 mcg.h/mL. The serum half-life of nafcillin administered by the intravenous route ranged from 33 to 61 minutes as measured in three separate studies. In contrast to the other penicillinase-resistant penicillins, only about 30% of nafcillin is excreted as unchanged drug in the urine of normal volunteers, and most within the first six hours. Nafcillin is primarily eliminated by nonrenal routes, namely hepatic inactivation and excretion in the bile. Nafcillin binds to serum proteins, mainly albumin. The degree of protein binding reported for nafcillin is 89.9 \u00b1 1.5%. Reported values vary with the method of study and the investigator. The concurrent administration of probenecid with nafcillin increases and prolongs plasma concentrations of nafcillin. Probenecid significantly reduces the total body clearance of nafcillin with renal clearance being decreased to a greater extent than nonrenal clearance. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins are widely distributed in various body fluids, including bile, pleural, amniotic and synovial fluids. With normal doses insignificant concentrations are found in the aqueous humor of the eye. High nafcillin CSF levels have been obtained in the presence of inflamed meninges. Renal failure does not appreciably affect the serum half-life of nafcillin; therefore, no modification of the usual nafcillin dosage is necessary in renal failure with or without hemodialysis. Hemodialysis does not accelerate the rate of clearance of nafcillin from the blood. A study which assessed the effects of cirrhosis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction in man demonstrated that the plasma clearance of nafcillin was significantly decreased in patients with hepatic dysfunction. In these patients with cirrhosis and extrahepatic obstruction, nafcillin excretion in the urine was significantly increased from about 30 to 50% of the administered dose, suggesting that renal disease superimposed on hepatic disease could further decrease nafcillin clearance. PHARMACOKINETICS Intramuscular injections of nafcillin sodium, USP 1 gram produced peak serum levels in 0.5 to 1 hour of 7.61 mcg/mL. The degree of protein binding reported has been 89.9 +/-1.5%. With normal doses nafcillin is found in therapeutic concentrations in the pleural, bile, and amniotic fluids. Insignificant concentrations are found in the cerebrospinal fluid and aqueous humor. Blood concentrations may be tripled by the concurrent use of probenecid. Clinical studies with nafcillin sodium in infants under three days of age and prematures have revealed higher blood levels and slower rates of urinary excretion than in older children and adults. A high concentration of nafcillin sodium is excreted via the bile. About 30% of an intramuscular dose is excreted in the urine.

Methadone Hydrochloride Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Methadone hydrochloride is a mu-agonist; a synthetic opioid analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine, the most prominent of which involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. The principal therapeutic uses for methadone are for analgesia and for detoxification or maintenance in opioid addiction. The methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe. Some data also indicate that methadone acts as an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The contribution of NMDA receptor antagonism to methadone\u2019s efficacy is unknown. Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Methadone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Methadone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Some NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to produce neurotoxic effects in animals. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Methadone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Methadone produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of methadone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing methadone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Methadone Hydrochloride Injection is intended for parenteral (intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular) administration. Methadone pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration have not been systematically studied and differences among the various parenteral routes have not been well characterized. As with many drugs, absorption into the systemic circulation may vary with subcutaneous and intramuscular administration. Distribution Methadone is a lipophilic drug and the steady state volume of distribution ranges between 2 L/kg to 6 L/kg. In plasma, methadone is predominantly bound to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein (85% to 90%). Methadone is secreted in saliva, breast milk, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord plasma. Elimination Metabolism Methadone is primarily metabolized by N-demethylation to an inactive metabolite, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidene (EDDP). Cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, are responsible for conversion of methadone to EDDP and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted mainly in urine. Excretion Elimination of methadone is mediated by extensive biotransformation, followed by renal and fecal excretion. After single intravenous dose administration the plasma clearance of methadone ranged between 3 L/h to 10 L/h and the terminal half-life (t \u00bd ) ranged between 8 to 59 hours. Methadone has been known to persist in the liver and other tissues. Slow release from the liver and other tissues may prolong the duration of methadone action despite low plasma concentrations. Specific Populations Use During Pregnancy There are no pharmacokinetic studies of parenteral methadone in pregnancy. The disposition of oral methadone has been studied in approximately 30 pregnant patients in 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters. Elimination of methadone was significantly changed in pregnancy. Total body clearance of methadone was increased in pregnant patients compared to the same patients postpartum or to non-pregnant opioid-dependent women. The terminal half-life of methadone is decreased during second and third trimesters. The decrease in plasma half-life and increased clearance of methadone resulting in lower methadone trough levels during pregnancy can lead to withdrawal symptoms in some pregnant patients. The dosage may need to be increased or the dosing interval decreased in pregnant patients receiving methadone (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Impairment Methadone pharmacokinetics have not been extensively evaluated in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Methadone is metabolized in the liver and patients with liver impairment may be at risk of accumulating methadone after multiple dosing. Renal Impairment Methadone pharmacokinetics have not been extensively evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. Unchanged methadone and its metabolites are excreted in urine to a variable degree. Methadone is a basic (pKa = 9.2) compound and the luminal pH of the urinary tract can affect its extraction from plasma. Urine acidification has been shown to increase renal elimination of methadone. Forced diuresis, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been established as beneficial for increasing methadone or metabolite elimination. Sex The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated for sex specificity. Race The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated for race specificity. Age Geriatric Population: The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated in geriatric population. Pediatric Population: The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated in pediatric population. Drug Interaction Studies Cytochrome P450 Interactions Methadone undergoes hepatic N-demethylation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, principally CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. Co-administration of methadone with CYP inducers may result in more rapid metabolism and potential for decreased effects of methadone, whereas administration with CYP inhibitors may reduce metabolism and potentiate methadone\u2019s effects. Although antiretroviral drugs such as efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, lopinavir+ritonavir combination are known to inhibit some CYPs, they are shown to reduce the plasma levels of methadone, possibly due to CYP induction activity (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Cytochrome P450 Inducers The following drug interactions were reported following co-administration of methadone with known inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes: Rifampin In patients well-stabilized on methadone, concomitant administration of rifampin resulted in a marked reduction in serum methadone levels and a concurrent appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Phenytoin In a pharmacokinetic study with patients on methadone maintenance therapy, phenytoin administration (250 mg twice daily initially for 1 day followed by 300 mg daily for 3 to 4 days) resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in methadone exposure and withdrawal symptoms occurred concurrently. Upon discontinuation of phenytoin, the incidence of withdrawal symptoms decreased and methadone exposure increased to a level comparable to that prior to phenytoin administration. St. John\u2019s Wort, Phenobarbital, Carbamazepine Administration of methadone with other CYP3A4 inducers may result in withdrawal symptoms. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors Voriconazole Voriconazole can inhibit the activity of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Repeat dose administration of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 4 days) increased the peak plasma concentration (C max ) and AUC of (R)-methadone by 31% and 47%, respectively, in subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (30 mg to 100 mg daily. The C max and AUC of (S)-methadone increased by 65% and 103%, respectively. Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during co-administration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Antiretroviral Drugs Although antiretroviral drugs such as efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, telaprevir, lopinavir+ritonavir combination are known to inhibit some CYPs, they are shown to reduce the plasma levels of methadone, possibly due to CYP induction activity. Abacavir, amprenavir, darunavir+ritonavir, efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, telaprevir, lopinavir+ritonavir, saquinavir+ritonavir, tipranvir+ritonavir combination Co-administration of these anti-retroviral agents resulted in increased clearance or decreased plasma levels of methadone (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Didanosine and Stavudine Methadone decreased the AUC and peak levels for didanosine and stavudine, with a more significant decrease for didanosine. Methadone disposition was not substantially altered (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Zidovudine Methadone increased the AUC of zidovudine which could result in toxic effects (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ).

The disposition of oral methadone has been studied in approximately 30 pregnant patients in 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters. Elimination of methadone was significantly changed in pregnancy.

A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion.Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration( 2.2 )and Use in Specific Populations( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem I.V. is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group.

{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE Dopamine Hydrochloride, USP is indicated for the correction of hemodynamic imbalances present in the shock syndrome due to myocardial infarction, trauma, endotoxic septicemia, open-heart surgery, renal failure, and chronic cardiac decompensation as in congestive failure. Patients most likely to respond adequately to Dopamine Hydrochloride, USP are those in whom physiological parameters, such as urine flow, myocardial function, and blood pressure, have not undergone profound deterioration. Multiclinic trials indicate that the shorter the time interval between onset of signs and symptoms and initiation of therapy with blood volume correction and Dopamine Hydrochloride, USP, the better the prognosis. Where appropriate, blood volume restoration with a suitable plasma expander or whole blood should be accomplished prior to administration of Dopamine Hydrochloride, USP. Poor Perfusion of Vital Organs \u2013 Urine flow appears to be one of the better diagnostic signs by which adequacy of vital organ perfusion can be monitored. Nevertheless, the physician should also observe the patient for signs of reversal of confusion or reversal of comatose condition. Loss of pallor, increase in toe temperature, and/or adequacy of nail bed capillary filling may also be used as indices of adequate dosage. Clinical studies have shown that when Dopamine Hydrochloride, USP is administered before urine flow has diminished to levels of approximately 0.3 mL/minute, prognosis is more favorable. Nevertheless, in a number of oliguric or anuric patients, administration of Dopamine Hydrochloride, USP has resulted in an increase in urine flow, which in some cases reached normal levels. Dopamine Hydrochloride, USP may also increase urine flow in patients whose output is within normal limits and thus may be of value in reducing the degree of pre-existing fluid accumulation. It should be noted that at doses above those optimal for the individual patient, urine flow may decrease, necessitating reduction of dosage. Low Cardiac Output \u2013 Increased cardiac output is related to dopamine\u2019s direct inotropic effect on the myocardium. Increased cardiac output at low or moderate doses appears to be related to a favorable prognosis. Increase in cardiac output has been associated with either static or decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Static or decreased SVR associated with low or moderate movements in cardiac output is believed to be a reflection of differential effects on specific vascular beds with increased resistance in peripheral beds (e.g., femoral) and concomitant decreases in mesenteric and renal vascular beds. Redistribution of blood flow parallels these changes so that an increase in cardiac output is accompanied by an increase in mesenteric and renal blood flow. In many instances the renal fraction of the total cardiac output has been found to increase. Increase in cardiac output produced by dopamine is not associated with substantial decreases in systemic vascular resistance as may occur with isoproterenol. Hypotension \u2013 Hypotension due to inadequate cardiac output can be managed by administration of low to moderate doses of Dopamine Hydrochloride, USP which have little effect on SVR. At high therapeutic doses, dopamine\u2019s alpha-adrenergic activity becomes more prominent and thus may correct hypotension due to diminished SVR. As in the case of other circulatory decompensation states, prognosis is better in patients whose blood pressure and urine flow have not undergone profound deterioration.

(See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Dopamine is a natural catecholamine formed by the decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). It is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system, especially in the nigrostriatal tract, and in a few peripheral sympathetic nerves. Dopamine produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting an agonist action on beta-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings. Dopamine\u2019s onset of action occurs within five minutes of intravenous administration, and with dopamine\u2019s plasma half-life of about two minutes, the duration of action is less than ten minutes. However, if monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are present, the duration may increase to one hour. The drug is widely distributed in the body but does not cross the blood-brain barrier to a significant extent. Dopamine is metabolized in the liver, kidney, and plasma by MAO and catechol\u2011O-methyltransferase to the inactive compounds homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4\u2011dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. About 25% of the dose is taken up into specialized neurosecretory vesicles (the adrenergic nerve terminals), where it is hydroxylated to form norepinephrine. It has been reported that about 80% of the drug is excreted in the urine within 24 hours, primarily as HVA and its sulfate and glucuronide conjugates and as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. A very small portion is excreted unchanged. The predominant effects of dopamine are dose-related, although it should be noted that actual response of an individual patient will largely depend on the clinical status of the patient at the time the drug is administered. At low rates of infusion (0.5 \u2013 2 mcg/kg/min) dopamine causes vasodilation that is presumed to be due to a specific agonist action on dopamine receptors (distinct from alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors) in the renal, mesenteric, coronary, and intracerebral vascular beds. At these dopamine receptors, haloperidol is an antagonist. The vasodilation in these vascular beds is accompanied by increased glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, sodium excretion, and urine flow. Hypotension sometimes occurs. An increase in urinary output produced by dopamine is usually not associated with a decrease in osmolality of the urine. At intermediate rates of infusion (2 \u2013 10 mcg/kg/min) dopamine acts to stimulate the beta1-adrenoceptors, resulting in improved myocardial contractility, increased SA rate and enhanced impulse conduction in the heart. There is little, if any, stimulation of the beta2-adrenoceptors (peripheral vasodilation). Dopamine causes less increase in myocardial oxygen consumption than isoproterenol, and its use is not usually associated with a tachyarrhythmia. Clinical studies indicate that it usually increases systolic and pulse pressure with either no effect or a slight increase in diastolic pressure. Blood flow to the peripheral vascular beds may decrease while mesenteric flow increases due to increased cardiac output. Total peripheral resistance (alpha effects) at low and intermediate doses is usually unchanged. At higher rates of infusion (10 \u2013 20 mcg/kg/min) there is some effect on alpha-adrenoceptors, with consequent vasoconstrictor effects and a rise in blood pressure. The vasoconstrictor effects are first seen in the skeletal muscle vascular beds, but with increasing doses, they are also evident in the renal and mesenteric vessels. At very high rates of infusion (above 20 mcg/kg/min), stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors predominates and vasoconstriction may compromise the circulation of the limbs and override the dopaminergic effects of dopamine, reversing renal dilation and naturesis."], "manufacturer_name": ["Medical Purchasing Solutions, LLC"], "substance_name": ["DOPAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20231102", "product_ndc": ["71872-7305"], "brand_name": ["Dopamine Hydrochloride"]}

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Vasopressin causes vasoconstriction by binding to V 1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle coupled to the Gq/11-phospholipase C-phosphatidyl-inositol-triphosphate pathway, resulting in the release of intracellular calcium. In addition, vasopressin stimulates antidiuresis via stimulation of V 2 receptors which are coupled to adenyl cyclase. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics At therapeutic doses exogenous vasopressin elicits a vasoconstrictive effect in most vascular beds including the splanchnic, renal and cutaneous circulation. In addition, vasopressin at pressor doses triggers contractions of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract mediated by muscular V 1 -receptors and release of prolactin and ACTH via V 3 receptors. At lower concentrations typical for the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin inhibits water diuresis via renal V 2 receptors. In addition, vasopressin has been demonstrated to cause vasodilation in numerous vascular beds that are mediated by V 2 , V 3 , oxytocin and purinergic P2 receptors. In patients with vasodilatory shock vasopressin in therapeutic doses increases systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial blood pressure and reduces the dose requirements for norepinephrine. Vasopressin tends to decrease heart rate and cardiac output. The pressor effect is proportional to the infusion rate of exogenous vasopressin. The pressor effect reaches its peak within 15 minutes. After stopping the infusion the pressor effect fades within 20 minutes. There is no evidence for tachyphylaxis or tolerance to the pressor effect of vasopressin in patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Vasopressin plasma concentrations increase linearly with increasing infusion rates from 10 to 200 \u03bcU/kg/min. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 30 minutes of continuous intravenous infusion. Distribution Vasopressin does not appear to bind plasma protein. The volume of distribution is 140 mL/kg. Elimination At infusion rates used in vasodilatory shock (0.01 to 0.1 units/minute), the clearance of vasopressin is 9 to 25 mL/min/kg in patients with vasodilatory shock. The apparent t 1/2 of vasopressin at these levels is \u226410 minutes. Metabolism Serine protease, carboxipeptidase and disulfide oxido-reductase cleave vasopressin at sites relevant for the pharmacological activity of the hormone. Thus, the generated metabolites are not expected to retain important pharmacological activity. Excretion Vasopressin is predominantly metabolized and only about 6% of the dose is excreted unchanged into urine. Specific Populations Pregnancy: Because of a spillover into blood of placental vasopressinase, the clearance of exogenous and endogenous vasopressin increases gradually over the course of a pregnancy. During the first trimester of pregnancy, the clearance is only slightly increased. However, by the third trimester the clearance of vasopressin is increased about 4-fold and at term up to 5-fold. After delivery, the clearance of vasopressin returns to preconception baseline within two weeks .

These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, exocrine glands and, to a limited degree, in the autonomic ganglia. Thus, it diminishes the volume and free acidity of gastric secretions and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal, and bronchial secretions. Glycopyrrolate antagonizes muscarinic symptoms (e.g., bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, and intestinal hypermotility) induced by cholinergic drugs such as the anticholinesterases. The highly polar quaternary ammonium group of glycopyrrolate limits its passage across lipid membranes, such as the blood-brain barrier, in contrast to atropine sulfate and scopolamine hydrobromide, which are highly non-polar tertiary amines which penetrate lipid barriers easily. With intravenous injection, the onset of action is generally evident within one minute. Following intramuscular administration, the onset of action is noted in 15 to 30 minutes, with peak effects occurring within approximately 30 to 45 minutes. The vagal blocking effects persist for 2 to 3 hours and the antisialagogue effects persist up to 7 hours, periods longer than for atropine.

{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cosyntropin for Injection is intended for use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency. Because of its rapid effect on the adrenal cortex it may be utilized to perform a 30-minute test of adrenal function (plasma cortisol response) as an office or outpatient procedure, using only 2 venipunctures (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). Severe hypofunction of the pituitary - adrenal axis is usually associated with subnormal plasma cortisol values but a low basal level is not per se evidence of adrenal insufficiency and does not suffice to make the diagnosis. Many patients with proven insufficiency will have normal basal levels and will develop signs of insufficiency only when stressed. For this reason a criterion which should be used in establishing the diagnosis is the failure to respond to adequate corticotropin stimulation. When presumptive adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed by a subnormal Cosyntropin for Injection test, further studies are indicated to determine if it is primary or secondary. Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) is the result of an intrinsic disease process, such as tuberculosis within the gland. The production of adrenocortical hormones is deficient despite high ACTH levels (feedback mechanism). Secondary or relative insufficiency arises as the result of defective production of ACTH leading in turn to disuse atrophy of the adrenal cortex. It is commonly seen, for example, as result of corticosteroid therapy, Sheehan's syndrome and pituitary tumors or ablation. The differentiation of both types is based on the premise that a primarily defective gland cannot be stimulated by ACTH whereas a secondarily defective gland is potentially functional and will respond to adequate stimulation with ACTH. Patients selected for further study as the result of a subnormal Cosyntropin for Injection test should be given a 3 or 4 day course of treatment with Repository Corticotropin Injection USP and then retested. Suggested doses are 40 USP units twice daily for 4 days or 60 USP units twice daily for 3 days. Under these conditions little or no increase in plasma cortisol levels will be seen in Addison's disease whereas higher or even normal levels will be seen in cases with secondary adrenal insufficiency."], "generic_name": ["COSYNTROPIN"], "id": "094426f5-3a15-37e5-e063-6394a90aa985", "route": ["INTRAVENOUS"], "description": ["DESCRIPTION Cosyntropin for Injection is a sterile lyophilized powder in vials containing 0.25 mg of Cosyntropin and 10 mg of mannitol to be reconstituted with 1 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.

This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher plasma concentrations, metoprolol also inhibits beta 2 -adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature. Metoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity is detectable only at plasma concentrations much greater than required for beta-blockade. Animal and human experiments indicate that metoprolol slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction. The relative beta 1 -selectivity of metoprolol has been confirmed by the following: (1) In normal subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta 2 -mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of nonselective beta-blockers, which completely reverse the vasodilating effects of epinephrine. (2) In asthmatic patients, metoprolol reduces FEV 1 and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta 1 -receptor blocking doses. The precise mechanism of action of metoprolol tartrate injection in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction is not known. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics When the drug was infused over a 10-minute period, in normal volunteers, maximum beta blockade was achieved at approximately 20 minutes. Equivalent maximal beta-blocking effect is achieved with oral and intravenous doses in the ratio of approximately 2.5:1. There is a linear relationship between the log of plasma levels and reduction of exercise heart rate. In several studies of patients with acute myocardial infarction, intravenous followed by oral administration of metoprolol tartrate injection caused a reduction in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and cardiac output. Stroke volume, diastolic blood pressure and pulmonary artery end diastolic pressure remained unchanged. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution About 12% of the drug is bound to human serum albumin. Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous plasma concentration. Elimination Elimination is mainly by biotransformation in the liver, and the plasma half-life ranges from approximately 3 hours to 7 hours. Metabolism Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S- enantiomers, and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. When administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype. Excretion Less than 5% of an oral dose of metoprolol is recovered unchanged in the urine; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity. Following intravenous administration of metoprolol, the urinary recovery of unchanged drug is approximately 10%. Mean dialytic clearance of metoprolol following oral administration in patients receiving high-flux hemodialysis is 87 mL/min. Mean total systemic clearance of metoprolol following intravenous administration in patients with chronic renal failure is 1 L/min. Drug Interactions CYP2D6 Metoprolol is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6. In healthy subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype, co-administration of quinidine 100 mg, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and immediate-release metoprolol 200 mg tripled the concentration of S-metoprolol and doubled the metoprolol elimination half-life. In four patients with cardiovascular disease, co-administration of propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. with immediate-release metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d. resulted in steady-state concentration of metoprolol 2- to 5-fold what is seen with metoprolol alone. Extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2D6 is absent in about 8% of Caucasians (poor metabolizers) and about 2% of most other populations.

It has the following structural formula: Levetiracetam, USP is a white to off-white crystalline powder with a faint odor and a bitter taste. It is very soluble in water (104.0 g/100 mL). It is freely soluble in chloroform (65.3 g/100 mL) and in methanol (53.6 g/100 mL), soluble in ethanol (16.5 g/100 mL), sparingly soluble in acetonitrile (5.7 g/100 mL) and practically insoluble in n-hexane. (Solubility limits are expressed as g/100 mL solvent.) Levetiracetam Injection contains 100 mg of levetiracetam per mL. It is supplied in single-dose 5 mL vials containing 500 mg levetiracetam, water for injection, 45 mg sodium chloride, and buffered at approximately pH 5.5 with glacial acetic acid and 8.2 mg sodium acetate trihydrate. Levetiracetam Injection must be diluted prior to intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ]. chemical structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism(s) by which levetiracetam exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown. A saturable and stereoselective neuronal binding site in rat brain tissue has been described for levetiracetam. Experimental data indicate that this binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, thought to be involved in the regulation of vesicle exocytosis. Although the molecular significance of levetiracetam binding to synaptic vesicle protein SV2A is not understood, levetiracetam and related analogs showed a rank order of affinity for SV2A which correlated with the potency of their antiseizure activity in audiogenic seizure-prone mice. These findings suggest that the interaction of levetiracetam with the SV2A protein may contribute to the antiepileptic mechanism of action of the drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on QTc Interval The effect of Levetiracetam Injection on QTc prolongation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) and placebo-controlled crossover study of Levetiracetam Injection (1000 mg or 5000 mg) in 52 healthy subjects. The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc was below 10 milliseconds. Therefore, there was no evidence of significant QTc prolongation in this study. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) levetiracetam and oral levetiracetam result in equivalent C max , C min , and total systemic exposure to levetiracetam when the IV levetiracetam is administered as a 15-minute infusion. Overview Levetiracetam is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. Levetiracetam injection and tablets are bioequivalent. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (<10% bound) and its volume of distribution is close to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam (24% of dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. It is not liver cytochrome P450 dependent. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. Plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6-8 hours. It is increased in the elderly (primarily due to impaired renal clearance) and in subjects with renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures. Distribution The equivalence of levetiracetam injection and the oral formulation was demonstrated in a bioavailability study of 17 healthy volunteers. In this study, levetiracetam 1500 mg was diluted in 100 mL 0.9% sterile saline solution and was infused over 15 minutes. The selected infusion rate provided plasma concentrations of levetiracetam at the end of the infusion period similar to those achieved at T max after an equivalent oral dose. It is demonstrated that levetiracetam 1500 mg intravenous infusion is equivalent to levetiracetam 3 x 500 mg oral tablets. The time independent pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam was demonstrated following 1500 mg intravenous infusion for 4 days with BID dosing. The AUC (0-12) at steady-state was equivalent to AUCi nf following an equivalent single dose. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite are less than 10% bound to plasma proteins; clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are therefore unlikely. Metabolism Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose) and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The major metabolite is inactive in animal seizure models. Two minor metabolites were identified as the product of hydroxylation of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring (2% of dose) and opening of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring in position 5 (1% of dose). There is no enantiomeric interconversion of levetiracetam or its major metabolite. Elimination Levetiracetam plasma half-life in adults is 7 \u00b1 1 hour and is unaffected by either dose, route of administration or repeated administration. Levetiracetam is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug which represents 66% of administered dose. The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The mechanism of excretion is glomerular filtration with subsequent partial tubular reabsorption. The metabolite ucb L057 is excreted by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. Levetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance. Levetiracetam clearance is reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Specific Populations Elderly Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 16 elderly subjects (age 61-88 years) with creatinine clearance ranging from 30 to 74 mL/min. Following oral administration of twice-daily dosing for 10 days, total body clearance decreased by 38% and the half-life was 2.5 hours longer in the elderly compared to healthy adults. This is most likely due to the decrease in renal function in these subjects. Pediatric Patients \u2022 Intravenous Formulation A population pharmacokinetic analysis for the intravenous formulation was conducted in 49 pediatric patients (1 month to < 16 years of age) weighing 3-79 kg. Patients received levetiracetam as a 15-minute IV infusion at doses between 14 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day twice daily. Plasma concentrations and model derived steady-state exposure AUC (0-12) were within the range of the exposure observed in pediatric patients receiving equivalent doses of the oral solution. \u2022 Oral Formulations Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 24 pediatric patients (age 6-12 years) after single oral dose (20 mg/kg) of the immediate release formulation of Levetiracetam. The body weight adjusted apparent clearance of levetiracetam was approximately 40% higher than in adults. A repeat dose pharmacokinetic study was conducted in pediatric patients (age 4-12 years) at doses of 20 mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day, and 60 mg/kg/day of the immediate release formulation of Levetiracetam. The evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam and its metabolite (ucb L057) in 14 pediatric patients demonstrated rapid absorption of levetiracetam at all doses, with a T max of about 1 hour and a t 1/2 of 5 hours across all dosing levels. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam in pediatric patients was linear between 20 to 60 mg/kg/day. The potential interaction of levetiracetam with other AEDs was also evaluated in these patients. Levetiracetam had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate or lamotrigine. However, there was about a 22% increase of apparent clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with an enzyme-inducing AED (e.g., carbamazepine). Following single dose administration (20 mg/kg) of a 10% oral solution to pediatric patients with epilepsy (1 month to < 4 years), levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed and peak plasma concentrations were observed approximately 1 hour after dosing. Levetiracetam half-life in pediatric patients 1 month to < 4 years with epilepsy was shorter (5.3 h) than in adults (7.2 h), and apparent clearance (1.5 mL/min/kg) was faster than in adults (0.96 mL/min/kg). Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that body weight was significantly correlated to the clearance of levetiracetam in pediatric patients; clearance increased with an increase in body weight. Pregnancy Levetiracetam levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ]. Gender Levetiracetam C max and AUC were 20% higher in women (N=11) compared to men (N=12). However, clearances adjusted for body weight were comparable. Race Formal pharmacokinetic studies of the effects of race have not been conducted. Cross-study comparisons involving Caucasians (N=12) and Asians (N=12), however, show that pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were comparable between the two races. Because levetiracetam is primarily renally excreted and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected. Renal Impairment The disposition of levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with impaired renal function by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50-80 mL/min), 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30-50 mL/min) and 60% in the severe renal impairment group (CLcr <30 mL/min). Clearance of levetiracetam is correlated with creatinine clearance. In anuric (end stage renal disease) patients, the total body clearance decreased 70% compared to normal subjects (CLcr >80mL/min). Approximately 50% of the pool of levetiracetam in the body is removed during a standard 4 hour hemodialysis procedure [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) ]. Hepatic Impairment In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were unchanged. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), total body clearance was 50% that of normal subjects, but decreased renal clearance accounted for most of the decrease. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions In vitro data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above C max levels achieved within the therapeutic dose range, are neither inhibitors of, nor high affinity substrates for, human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms, epoxide hydrolase or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes. In addition, levetiracetam does not affect the in vitro glucuronidation of valproic acid. Potential pharmacokinetic interactions of or with levetiracetam were assessed in clinical pharmacokinetic studies (phenytoin, valproate, warfarin, digoxin, oral contraceptive, probenecid) and through pharmacokinetic screening in the placebo-controlled clinical studies in epilepsy patients. Phenytoin Levetiracetam Injection (3000 mg daily) had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of phenytoin in patients with refractory epilepsy. Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were also not affected by phenytoin. Valproate Levetiracetam Injection (1500 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of valproate in healthy volunteers. Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption or its plasma clearance or urinary excretion. There also was no effect on exposure to and the excretion of the primary metabolite, ucb L057. Other Antiepileptic Drugs Potential drug interactions between Levetiracetam Injection and other AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and valproate) were also assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these AEDs during placebo-controlled clinical studies. These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs and that these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. Effect of AEDs in Pediatric Patients There was about a 22% increase of apparent total body clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with enzyme-inducing AEDs. Dose adjustment is not recommended. Levetiracetam had no effect on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, or lamotrigine. Oral Contraceptives Levetiracetam Injection (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, or of the luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. Digoxin Levetiracetam Injection (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (ECG) of digoxin given as a 0.25 mg dose every day. Co-administration of digoxin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. Warfarin Levetiracetam Injection (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of R and S warfarin. Prothrombin time was not affected by levetiracetam. Co-administration of warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. Probenecid Probenecid, a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, administered at a dose of 500 mg four times a day, did not change the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam 1000 mg twice daily. C ss max of the metabolite, ucb L057, was approximately doubled in the presence of probenecid while the fraction of drug excreted unchanged in the urine remained the same. Renal clearance of ucb L057 in the presence of probenecid decreased 60%, probably related to competitive inhibition of tubular secretion of ucb L057.

Chemical Structure 11.2 Physical Characteristics Fluorine F 18 has a physical half-life of 109.8 minutes and decays to Oxygen O 18 (stable) by positron decay. The principal photons useful for imaging are the dual 511 keV \"annihilation\" gamma photons that are produced and emitted simultaneously in opposite directions when the positron interacts with an electron (Table 2).

Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported through the cell membrane by facilitative glucose transporter proteins and is phosphorylated within the cell to [ 18 F] FDG-6-phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase. Once phosphorylated it cannot exit until it is dephosphorylated by glucose-6-phosphatase. Therefore, within a given tissue or pathophysiological process, the retention and clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect a balance involving glucose transporter, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is used to assess glucose metabolism. In comparison to background activity of the specific organ or tissue type, regions of decreased or absent uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect the decrease or absence of glucose metabolism. Regions of increased uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect greater than normal rates of glucose metabolism. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection is rapidly distributed to all organs of the body after intravenous administration. After background clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection, optimal PET imaging is generally achieved between 30 to 40 minutes after administration. In cancer, the cells are generally characterized by enhanced glucose metabolism partially due to (1) an increase in activity of glucose transporters, (2) an increased rate of phosphorylation activity, (3) a reduction of phosphatase activity or, (4) a dynamic alteration in the balance among all these processes. However, glucose metabolism of cancer as reflected by Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation shows considerable variability. Depending on tumor type, stage, and location, Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation may be increased, normal, or decreased. Also, inflammatory cells can have the same variability of uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18. In the heart, under normal aerobic conditions, the myocardium meets the bulk of its energy requirements by oxidizing free fatty acids. Most of the exogenous glucose taken up by the myocyte is converted into glycogen. However, under ischemic conditions, the oxidation of free fatty acids decreases, exogenous glucose becomes the preferred myocardial substrate, glycolysis is stimulated, and glucose taken up by the myocyte is metabolized immediately instead of being converted into glycogen. Under these conditions, phosphorylated Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulates in the myocyte and can be detected with PET imaging. In the brain, cells normally rely on aerobic metabolism. In epilepsy, the glucose metabolism varies. Generally, during a seizure, glucose metabolism increases. Interictally, the seizure focus tends to be hypometabolic. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution : In four healthy male volunteers, receiving an intravenous administration of 30 seconds in duration, the arterial blood level profile for Fludeoxyglucose F 18 decayed triexponentially. The effective half-life ranges of the three phases were 0.2 to 0.3 minutes, 10 to 13 minutes with a mean and standard deviation (STD) of 12 \u00b1(1) min, and 80 to 95 minutes with a mean and STD of 88 (\u00b1) 4 min. Plasma protein binding of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 has not been studied. Metabolism : Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported into cells and phosphorylated to [F 18]-FDG-6-phosphate at a rate proportional to the rate of glucose utilization within that tissue. [F 18]-FDG-6-phosphate presumably is metabolized to 2-deoxy-2-[F 18]fluoro-6-phospho-D-mannose ([F 18]FDM-6-phosphate). Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection may contain several impurities (e.g., 2-deoxy-2-chloro-D-glucose (C1DG)). Biodistribution and metabolism of C1DG are presumed to be similar to Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and would be expected to result in intracellular formation of 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-glucose (C1DG-6-phosphate) and 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-mannose (C1DM-6-phosphate). The phosphorylated deoxyglucose compounds are dephosphorylated and the resulting compounds (FDG, FDM, C1DG, and C1DM) presumably leave cells by passive diffusion. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and related compounds are cleared from non-cardiac tissues within 3 to 24 hours after administration. Clearance from the cardiac tissue may require more than 96 hours. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 that is not involved in glucose metabolism in any tissue is then excreted in the urine. Elimination : Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is cleared from most tissues within 24 hours and can be eliminated from the body unchanged in the urine. Within 33 minutes, a mean of 3.9% of the administered radioactive dose was measured in the urine. The amount of radiation exposure of the urinary bladder at two hours post-administration suggests that 20.6% (mean) of the radioactive dose was present in the bladder. Special Populations : The pharmacokinetics of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection have not been studied in renally-impaired, hepatically impaired or pediatric patients. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is eliminated through the renal system. Avoid excessive radiation exposure to this organ system and adjacent tissues. The effects of fasting, varying blood sugar levels, conditions of glucose intolerance, and diabetes mellitus on Fludeoxyglucose F 18 distribution in humans have not been ascertained [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]."], "manufacturer_name": ["Precision Nuclear, LLC"], "substance_name": ["FLUDEOXYGLUCOSE F-18"], "effective_time": "20240209", "product_ndc": ["52768-001"], "brand_name": ["Fludeoxyglucose F-18"]}

In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Gentamicin Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species (indole-positive and indole-negative), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia species, Citrobacter species and Staphylococcus species (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative). Clinical studies have shown gentamicin injection to be effective in bacterial neonatal sepsis; bacterial septicemia and serious bacterial infections of the central nervous system (meningitis), urinary tract, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract (including peritonitis), skin, bone and soft tissue (including burns). Aminoglycosides, including gentamicin, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are susceptible to these antibiotics and are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential for toxicity. Specimens for bacterial culture should be obtained to isolate and identify causative organisms and to determine their susceptibility to gentamicin. Gentamicin injection may be considered as initial therapy in suspected or confirmed gram-negative infections, and therapy may be instituted before obtaining results of susceptibility testing. The decision to continue therapy with this drug should be based on the results of susceptibility tests, the severity of the infection and the important additional concepts contained in the BOXED WARNINGS . If the causative organisms are resistant to gentamicin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In serious infections when the causative organisms are unknown, gentamicin injection may be administered as initial therapy in conjunction with a penicillin-type or cephalosporin-type drug before obtaining results of susceptibility testing. If anaerobic organisms are suspected as etiologic agents, consideration should be given to using other suitable antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with gentamicin.

While some variation is to be expected due to a number of variables such as age, body temperature, surface area and physiologic differences, the individual patient given the same dose tends to have similar levels in repeated determinations. Gentamicin administered at 1 mg/kg every eight hours for the usual 7 to 10 day treatment period to patients with normal renal function does not accumulate in the serum. Gentamicin, like all aminoglycosides, may accumulate in the serum and tissues of patients treated with higher doses and/or for prolonged periods, particularly in the presence of impaired renal function. In adult patients, treatment with gentamicin dosages of 4 mg/kg/day or higher for 7 to 10 days may result in a slight, progressive rise in both peak and trough concentrations. In patients with impaired renal function, gentamicin is cleared from the body more slowly than in patients with normal renal function. The more severe the impairment, the slower the clearance. (Dosage must be adjusted.) Since gentamicin is distributed in extra-cellular fluid, peak serum concentrations may be lower than usual in adult patients who have a large volume of this fluid. Serum concentrations of gentamicin in febrile patients may be lower than those in afebrile patients given the same dose. When body temperature returns to normal, serum concentrations of the drug may rise. Febrile and anemic states may be associated with a shorter than usual serum half-life. (Dosage adjustment is usually not necessary.) In severely burned patients, the half-life may be significantly decreased and resulting serum concentrations may be lower than anticipated from the mg/kg dose. Protein binding studies have indicated that the degree of gentamicin binding is low; depending upon the methods used for testing, this may be between 0 and 30%. After initial administration to patients with normal renal function, generally 70% or more of the gentamicin dose is recoverable in the urine in 24 hours; concentrations in urine above 100 mcg/mL may be achieved. Little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs; the drug is excreted principally by glomerular filtration. After several days of treatment, the amount of gentamicin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. As with other aminoglycosides, a small amount of the gentamicin dose may be retained in the tissues, especially in the kidneys. Minute quantities of aminoglycosides have been detected in the urine weeks after drug administration was discontinued. Renal clearance of gentamicin is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. In patients with marked impairment of renal function, there is a decrease in the concentration of aminoglycosides in urine and in their penetration into defective renal parenchyma. This decreased drug excretion, together with the potential nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides, should be considered when treating such patients who have urinary tract infections. Probenecid does not affect renal tubular transport of gentamicin. The endogenous creatinine clearance rate and the serum creatinine level have a high correlation with the half-life of gentamicin in serum. Results of these tests may serve as guides for adjusting dosage in patients with renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, gentamicin can be detected in serum, lymph, tissues, sputum and in pleural, synovial and peritoneal fluids. Concentrations in renal cortex sometimes may be eight times higher than the usual serum levels. Concentrations in bile, in general, have been low and have suggested minimal biliary excretion. Gentamicin crosses the peritoneal as well as the placental membranes. Since aminoglycosides diffuse poorly into the subarachnoid space after parenteral administration, concentrations of gentamicin in cerebrospinal fluid are often low and dependent upon dose, rate of penetration and degree of meningeal inflammation. There is minimal penetration of gentamicin into ocular tissues following IM or IV administration. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside, binds to the prokaryotic ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis in susceptible bacteria. It is bactericidal in vitro against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Resistance Bacterial resistance to gentamicin is generally developed slowly. Bacteria resistant to one aminoglycoside may be resistant to one or more other aminoglycosides. The following bacteria are usually resistant to the aminoglycosides, including gentamicin: most streptococcal species (including Streptococcus pneumoniae and the Group D streptococci), most enterococcal species (including Enterococcus faecalis , E. faecium , and E. durans ), and anaerobic organisms, such as Bacteroides species and Clostridium species. Aminoglycosides are known to be not effective against Salmonella and Shigella species in patients. Therefore, in vitro susceptibility test results should not be reported. Interactions with Other Antimicrobials In vitro studies show that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell wall synthesis may act synergistically against some enterococcal strains. The combination of gentamicin and penicillin G has a synergistic bactericidal effect against strains of Enterococcus faecalis , E. faecium and E. durans . An enhanced killing effect against many of these strains has also been shown in vitro with combinations of gentamicin and ampicillin, carbenicillin, nafcillin or oxacillin. The combined effect of gentamicin and carbenicillin is synergistic for many strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . In vitro synergism against other Gram-negative organisms has been shown with combinations of gentamicin and cephalosporins. Gentamicin may be active against clinical isolates of bacteria resistant to other aminoglycosides. Antibacterial Activity Gentamicin has been shown to be active against most of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ).

Dilution Technique Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs).

Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine, but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides.

Midazolam is a white to light yellow crystalline compound, insoluble in water. The hydrochloride salt of midazolam, which is formed in situ , is soluble in aqueous solutions. Chemically, midazolam HCl is 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4 H -imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine hydrochloride. Midazolam hydrochloride has the following structural formula: C 18 H 13 ClFN 3 \u2022 HCl M.W. 362.25 Under the acidic conditions required to solubilize midazolam in the product, midazolam is present as an equilibrium mixture (shown below) of the closed ring form shown above and an open-ring structure formed by the acid-catalyzed ring opening of the 4,5-double bond of the diazepine ring. The amount of open-ring form is dependent upon the pH of the solution. At the specified pH of the product, the solution may contain up to about 25% of the open-ring compound. At the physiologic conditions under which the product is absorbed (pH of 5 to 8) into the systemic circulation, any open-ring form present reverts to the physiologically active, lipophilic, closed-ring form (midazolam) and is absorbed as such. The following chart plots the percentage of midazolam present as the open-ring form as a function of pH in aqueous solutions. As indicated in the graph, the amount of open-ring compound present in solution is sensitive to changes in pH over the pH range specified for the product: 3.0 to 3.6 for the 5 mg/mL concentration.

Pharmacodynamics The effects of midazolam on the CNS are dependent on the dose administered, the route of administration, and the presence or absence of other medications. Onset time of sedative effects after IM administration in adults is 15 minutes, with peak sedation occurring 30 to 60 minutes following injection. In one adult study, when tested the following day, 73% of the patients who received midazolam intramuscularly had no recall of memory cards shown 30 minutes following drug administration; 40% had no recall of the memory cards shown 60 minutes following drug administration. Onset time of sedative effects in the pediatric population begins within 5 minutes and peaks at 15 to 30 minutes depending upon the dose administered. In pediatric patients, up to 85% had no recall of pictures shown after receiving intramuscular midazolam compared with 5% of the placebo controls. Sedation in adult and pediatric patients is achieved within 3 to 5 minutes after intravenous (IV) injection; the time of onset is affected by total dose administered and the concurrent administration of narcotic premedication. Seventy-one percent of the adult patients in endoscopy studies had no recall of introduction of the endoscope; 82% of the patients had no recall of withdrawal of the endoscope. In one study of pediatric patients undergoing lumbar puncture or bone marrow aspiration, 88% of patients had impaired recall vs 9% of the placebo controls. In another pediatric oncology study, 91% of midazolam treated patients were amnestic compared with 35% of patients who had received fentanyl alone. When midazolam is given IV as an anesthetic induction agent, induction of anesthesia occurs in approximately 1.5 minutes when narcotic premedication has been administered and in 2 to 2.5 minutes without narcotic premedication or other sedative premedication. Some impairment in a test of memory was noted in 90% of the patients studied. A dose response study of pediatric patients premedicated with 1 mg/kg intramuscular (IM) meperidine found that only 4 out of 6 pediatric patients who received 600 mcg/kg IV midazolam lost consciousness, with eye closing at 108 to 140 seconds. This group was compared with pediatric patients who were given thiopental 5 mg/kg IV; 6 out of 6 closed their eyes at 20 \u00b1 3.2 seconds. Midazolam did not dependably induce anesthesia at this dose despite concomitant opioid administration in pediatric patients. Midazolam, used as directed, does not delay awakening from general anesthesia in adults. Gross tests of recovery after awakening (orientation, ability to stand and walk, suitability for discharge from the recovery room, return to baseline Trieger competency) usually indicate recovery within 2 hours but recovery may take up to 6 hours in some cases. When compared with patients who received thiopental, patients who received midazolam generally recovered at a slightly slower rate. Recovery from anesthesia or sedation for procedures in pediatric patients depends on the dose of midazolam administered, coadministration of other medications causing CNS depression and duration of the procedure. In patients without intracranial lesions, induction of general anesthesia with IV midazolam is associated with a moderate decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure (lumbar puncture measurements), similar to that observed following IV thiopental. Preliminary data in neurosurgical patients with normal intracranial pressure but decreased compliance (subarachnoid screw measurements) show comparable elevations of intracranial pressure with midazolam and with thiopental during intubation. No similar studies have been reported in pediatric patients. The usual recommended intramuscular premedicating doses of midazolam do not depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation to a clinically significant extent in adults. Intravenous induction doses of midazolam depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation for 15 minutes or more beyond the duration of ventilatory depression following administration of thiopental in adults. Impairment of ventilatory response to carbon dioxide is more marked in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Sedation with IV midazolam does not adversely affect the mechanics of respiration (resistance, static recoil, most lung volume measurements); total lung capacity and peak expiratory flow decrease significantly but static compliance and maximum expiratory flow at 50% of awake total lung capacity (V max ) increase. In one study of pediatric patients under general anesthesia, intramuscular midazolam (100 mcg/kg or 200 mcg/kg) was shown to depress the response to carbon dioxide in a dose-related manner. In cardiac hemodynamic studies in adults, IV induction of general anesthesia with midazolam was associated with a slight to moderate decrease in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance. Slow heart rates (less than 65/minute), particularly in patients taking propranolol for angina, tended to rise slightly; faster heart rates (e.g., 85/minute) tended to slow slightly. In pediatric patients, a comparison of IV midazolam (500 mcg/kg) with propofol (2.5 mg/kg) revealed a mean 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure in patients who had received IV midazolam vs. a mean 25% decrease in systolic blood pressure following propofol. Pharmacokinetics Midazolam\u2019s activity is primarily due to the parent drug. Elimination of the parent drug takes place via hepatic metabolism of midazolam to hydroxylated metabolites that are conjugated and excreted in the urine. Six single-dose pharmacokinetic studies involving healthy adults yield pharmacokinetic parameters for midazolam in the following ranges: volume of distribution (Vd), 1.0 to 3.1 L/kg; elimination half-life, 1.8 to 6.4 hours (mean approximately 3 hours); total clearance (Cl), 0.25 to 0.54 L/hr/kg. In a parallel group study, there was no difference in the clearance, in subjects administered 0.15 mg/kg (n=4) and 0.30 mg/kg (n=4) IV doses indicating linear kinetics. The clearance was successively reduced by approximately 30% at doses of 0.45 mg/kg (n=4) and 0.6 mg/kg (n=5) indicating non-linear kinetics in this dose range. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of the intramuscular route was greater than 90% in a crossover study in which healthy subjects (n=17) were administered a 7.5 mg IV or IM dose. The mean peak concentration (C max ) and time to peak (T max ) following the IM dose was 90 ng/mL (20% CV) and 0.5 hour (50% CV). C max for the 1-hydroxy metabolite following the IM dose was 8 ng/mL (T max = 1.0 hour). Following IM administration, C max for midazolam and its 1-hydroxy metabolite were approximately one-half of those achieved after intravenous injection. Distribution The volume of distribution (Vd) determined from six single-dose pharmacokinetic studies involving healthy adults ranged from 1.0 to 3.1 L/kg. Female gender, old age, and obesity are associated with increased values of midazolam Vd. In humans, midazolam has been shown to cross the placenta and enter into fetal circulation and has been detected in human milk and CSF (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Special Populations ). In adults and pediatric patients older than 1 year, midazolam is approximately 97% bound to plasma protein, principally albumin and that for 1-hydroxy metabolite is about 89%. Metabolism In vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicate that the biotransformation of midazolam is mediated by cytochrome P450-3A4. This cytochrome also appears to be present in gastrointestinal tract mucosa as well as liver. Sixty to seventy percent of the biotransformation products is 1-hydroxy-midazolam (also termed alpha-hydroxy-midazolam) while 4-hydroxy-midazolam constitutes 5% or less. Small amounts of a dihydroxy derivative have also been detected but not quantified. The principal urinary excretion products are glucuronide conjugates of the hydroxylated derivatives. Drugs that inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450-3A4 may inhibit midazolam clearance and elevate steady-state midazolam concentrations. Studies of the intravenous administration of 1-hydroxy-midazolam in humans suggest that 1-hydroxy-midazolam is at least as potent as the parent compound and may contribute to the net pharmacologic activity of midazolam. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the affinities of 1- and 4-hydroxy-midazolam for the benzodiazepine receptor are approximately 20% and 7%, respectively, relative to midazolam. Excretion Clearance of midazolam is reduced in association with old age, congestive heart failure, liver disease (cirrhosis) or conditions which diminish cardiac output and hepatic blood flow. The principal urinary excretion product is 1-hydroxy-midazolam in the form of a glucuronide conjugate; smaller amounts of the glucuronide conjugates of 4-hydroxy- and dihydroxy-midazolam are detected as well. The amount of midazolam excreted unchanged in the urine after a single IV dose is less than 0.5% (n=5). Following a single IV infusion in 5 healthy volunteers, 45% to 57% of the dose was excreted in the urine as 1-hydroxymethyl midazolam conjugate. Pharmacokinetics-Continuous Infusion The pharmacokinetic profile of midazolam following continuous infusion, based on 282 adult subjects, has been shown to be similar to that following single-dose administration for subjects of comparable age, gender, body habitus and health status. However, midazolam can accumulate in peripheral tissues with continuous infusion. The effects of accumulation are greater after long-term infusions than after short-term infusions. The effects of accumulation can be reduced by maintaining the lowest midazolam infusion rate that produces satisfactory sedation. Infrequent hypotensive episodes have occurred during continuous infusion; however, neither the time to onset nor the duration of the episode appeared to be related to plasma concentrations of midazolam or alpha-hydroxy-midazolam. Further, there does not appear to be an increased chance of occurrence of a hypotensive episode with increased loading doses. Patients with renal impairment may have longer elimination half-lives for midazolam (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Special Populations , Renal Failure ). Special Populations Changes in the pharmacokinetic profile of midazolam due to drug interactions, physiological variables, etc., may result in changes in the plasma concentration-time profile and pharmacological response to midazolam in these patients. For example, patients with acute renal failure appear to have a longer elimination half-life for midazolam and may experience delayed recovery (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Special Populations, Renal Failure ). In other groups, the relationship between prolonged half-life and duration of effect has not been established. Pediatrics and Neonates: In pediatric patients aged 1 year and older, the pharmacokinetic properties following a single dose of midazolam reported in 10 separate studies of midazolam are similar to those in adults. Weight-normalized clearance is similar or higher (0.19 to 0.80 L/hr/kg) than in adults and the terminal elimination half-life (0.78 to 3.3 hours) is similar to or shorter than in adults. The pharmacokinetic properties during and following continuous intravenous infusion in pediatric patients in the operating room as an adjunct to general anesthesia and in the intensive care environment are similar to those in adults. In seriously ill neonates, however, the terminal elimination half-life of midazolam is substantially prolonged (6.5 to 12.0 hours) and the clearance reduced (0.07 to 0.12 L/hr/kg) compared to healthy adults or other groups of pediatric patients. It cannot be determined if these differences are due to age, immature organ function or metabolic pathways, underlying illness or debility. Obese: In a study comparing normals (n=20) and obese patients (n=20) the mean half-life was greater in the obese group (5.9 vs 2.3 hours). This was due to an increase of approximately 50% in the Vd corrected for total body weight. The clearance was not significantly different between groups. Geriatric: In three parallel group studies, the pharmacokinetics of midazolam administered IV or IM were compared in young (mean age 29, n=52) and healthy elderly subjects (mean age 73, n=53). Plasma half-life was approximately two-fold higher in the elderly. The mean Vd based on total body weight increased consistently between 15% to 100% in the elderly. The mean Cl decreased approximately 25% in the elderly in two studies and was similar to that of the younger patients in the other. Congestive Heart Failure: In patients suffering from congestive heart failure, there appeared to be a two-fold increase in the elimination half-life, a 25% decrease in the plasma clearance and a 40% increase in the volume of distribution of midazolam. Hepatic Impairment: Midazolam pharmacokinetics were studied after an IV single dose (0.075 mg/kg) was administered to 7 patients with biopsy proven alcoholic cirrhosis and 8 control patients. The mean half-life of midazolam increased 2.5-fold in the alcoholic patients. Clearance was reduced by 50% and the Vd increased by 20%. In another study in 21 male patients with cirrhosis, without ascites and with normal kidney function as determined by creatinine clearance, no changes in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam or 1-hydroxy-midazolam were observed when compared to healthy individuals. Renal Impairment: Patients with renal impairment may have longer elimination half-lives for midazolam and its metabolites which may result in slower recovery. Midazolam and 1-hydroxy-midazolam pharmacokinetics in 6 ICU patients who developed acute renal failure (ARF) were compared with a normal renal function control group. Midazolam was administered as an infusion (5 to 15 mg/hr). Midazolam clearance was reduced (1.9 vs 2.8 mL/min/kg) and the half-life was prolonged (7.6 vs 13 hours) in the ARF patients. The renal clearance of the 1-hydroxy-midazolam glucuronide was prolonged in the ARF group (4 vs 136 mL/min) and the half-life was prolonged (12 vs > 25 hours). Plasma levels accumulated in all ARF patients to about ten times that of the parent drug. The relationship between accumulating metabolite levels and prolonged sedation is unclear. In a study of chronic renal failure patients (n=15) receiving a single IV dose, there was a two-fold increase in the clearance and volume of distribution but the half-life remained unchanged. Metabolite levels were not studied. Plasma Concentration-Effect Relationship: Concentration-effect relationships (after an IV dose) have been demonstrated for a variety of pharmacodynamic measures (e.g., reaction time, eye movement, sedation) and are associated with extensive intersubject variability. Logistic regression analysis of sedation scores and steady-state plasma concentration indicated that at plasma concentrations greater than 100 ng/mL there was at least a 50% probability that patients would be sedated, but respond to verbal commands (sedation score = 3). At 200 ng/mL there was at least a 50% probability that patients would be asleep, but respond to glabellar tap (sedation score = 4).

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Epirubicin pharmacokinetics are linear over the dose range of 60 to 150 mg/m 2 and plasma clearance is not affected by the duration of infusion or administration schedule. Pharmacokinetic parameters for epirubicin following 6- to 10-minute, single-dose intravenous infusions of ELLENCE at doses of 60 to 150 mg/m 2 in patients with solid tumors are shown in Table 4. The plasma concentration declined in a triphasic manner with mean half-lives for the alpha, beta, and gamma phases of about 3 minutes, 2.5 hours, and 33 hours, respectively. Table 4.

Binding of epirubicin to plasma proteins, predominantly albumin, is about 77% and is not affected by drug concentration. Epirubicin also appears to concentrate in red blood cells; whole blood concentrations are approximately twice those of plasma. Metabolism Epirubicin is extensively and rapidly metabolized by the liver and is also metabolized by other organs and cells, including red blood cells. Four main metabolic routes have been identified: (1) reduction of the C-13 keto-group with the formation of the 13(S)-dihydro derivative, epirubicinol; (2) conjugation of both the unchanged drug and epirubicinol with glucuronic acid; (3) loss of the amino sugar moiety through a hydrolytic process with the formation of the doxorubicin and doxorubicinol aglycones; and (4) loss of the amino sugar moiety through a redox process with the formation of the 7-deoxy-doxorubicin aglycone and 7-deoxy-doxorubicinol aglycone. Epirubicinol has in vitro cytotoxic activity one-tenth that of epirubicin. As plasma levels of epirubicinol are lower than those of the unchanged drug, they are unlikely to reach in vivo concentrations sufficient for cytotoxicity. No significant activity or toxicity has been reported for the other metabolites. Excretion Epirubicin and its major metabolites are eliminated through biliary excretion and, to a lesser extent, by urinary excretion. Mass-balance data from 1 patient found about 60% of the total radioactive dose in feces (34%) and urine (27%). These data are consistent with those from 3 patients with extrahepatic obstruction and percutaneous drainage, in whom approximately 35% and 20% of the administered dose were recovered as epirubicin or its major metabolites in bile and urine, respectively, in the 4 days after treatment. Effect of Age A population analysis of plasma data from 36 cancer patients (13 males and 23 females, 20 to 73 years) showed that age affects plasma clearance of epirubicin in female patients. The predicted plasma clearance for a female patient of 70 years of age was about 35% lower than that for a female patient of 25 years of age. An insufficient number of males > 50 years of age were included in the study to draw conclusions about age-related alterations in clearance in males. Although a lower ELLENCE starting dose does not appear necessary in elderly female patients, and was not used in clinical trials, particular care should be taken in monitoring toxicity when ELLENCE is administered to female patients > 70 years of age . Effect of Gender In patients \u2264 50 years of age, mean clearance values in adult male and female patients were similar. The clearance of epirubicin is decreased in elderly women. Effect of Race The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of epirubicin has not been evaluated. Effect of Hepatic Impairment Epirubicin is eliminated by both hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion and clearance is reduced in patients with hepatic dysfunction. In a study of the effect of hepatic dysfunction, patients with solid tumors were classified into 3 groups. Patients in Group 1 (n=22) had serum AST (SGOT) levels above the upper limit of normal (median: 93 IU/L) and normal serum bilirubin levels (median: 0.5 mg/dL) and were given ELLENCE doses of 12.5 to 90 mg/m 2 . Patients in Group 2 had alterations in both serum AST (median: 175 IU/L) and bilirubin levels (median: 2.7 mg/dL) and were treated with an ELLENCE dose of 25 mg/m 2 (n=8). Their pharmacokinetics were compared to those of patients with normal serum AST and bilirubin values, who received ELLENCE doses of 12.5 to 120 mg/m 2 . The median plasma clearance of epirubicin was decreased compared to patients with normal hepatic function by about 30% in patients in Group 1 and by 50% in patients in Group 2. Patients with more severe hepatic impairment have not been evaluated [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Effect of Renal Impairment No significant alterations in the pharmacokinetics of epirubicin or its major metabolite, epirubicinol, have been observed in patients with serum creatinine < 5 mg/dL. A 50% reduction in plasma clearance was reported in four patients with serum creatinine \u2265 5 mg/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Dosing and Administration (2.2) ] . Patients on dialysis have not been studied. Effect of Paclitaxel The administration of paclitaxel (175\u2013225 mg/m 2 as a 3-hour infusion) immediately before or after epirubicin (90 mg/m 2 as bolus) caused variable increases in the systemic exposure (mean AUC) of epirubicin ranging from 5% to 109%. At same doses of epirubicin and paclitaxel, the mean AUC of the inactive metabolites of epirubicin (epirubicinol and 7-deoxy-aglycone) increased by 120% and 70%, respectively, when paclitaxel was immediately administered after epirubicin. Epirubicin had no effect on the exposure of paclitaxel whether it was administered before or after paclitaxel. Effect of Docetaxel The administration of docetaxel (70 mg/m 2 as 1-hour infusion) immediately before or after epirubicin (90 mg/m 2 as bolus) had no effect on the systemic exposure (mean AUC) of epirubicin. However, the mean AUC of epirubicinol and 7-deoxy-aglycone increased by 22.5% and 95%, respectively, when docetaxel was immediately administered after epirubicin compared to epirubicin alone. Epirubicin had no effect on the exposure of docetaxel whether it was administered before or after docetaxel. Effect of Cimetidine Coadministration of cimetidine (400 mg twice daily for 7 days starting 5 days before chemotherapy) increased the mean AUC of epirubicin (100 mg/m 2 ) by 50% and decreased its plasma clearance by 30% .

It has been demonstrated that furosemide inhibits primarily the reabsorption of sodium and chloride not only in the proximal and distal tubules but also in the loop of Henle. The high degree of efficacy is largely due to this unique site of action. The action on the distal tubule is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone. Recent evidence suggests that furosemide glucuronide is the only or at least the major biotransformation product of furosemide in man. Furosemide is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. Plasma concentrations ranging from 1 to 400 \u03bcg/mL are 91 to 99% bound in healthy individuals. The unbound fraction averages 2.3 to 4.1% at therapeutic concentrations. The onset of diuresis following intravenous administration is within 5 minutes and somewhat later after intramuscular administration. The peak effect occurs within the first half hour. The duration of diuretic effect is approximately 2 hours. In fasted normal men, the mean bioavailability of furosemide from furosemide tablets and furosemide oral solution is 64% and 60%, respectively, of that from an intravenous injection of the drug. Although furosemide is more rapidly absorbed from the oral solution (50 minutes) than from the tablet (87 minutes), peak plasma levels and area under the plasma concentration-time curves do not differ significantly. Peak plasma concentrations increase with increasing dose but times-to-peak do not differ among doses. The terminal half-life of furosemide is approximately 2 hours.

Microbiology Mechanism of Action Cefuroxime is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cefuroxime has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Mechanism of Resistance Resistance to cefuroxime is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In an in vitro study antagonistic effects have been observed with the combination of chloramphenicol and cefuroxime. Cefuroxime has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-negative bacteria Enterobacter spp. Escherichia coli Klebsiella spp. Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria meningitidis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

Figure Figure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection (I.V.) is a combination of imipenem and cilastatin. Imipenem is a penem antibacterial drug [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )] . Cilastatin is a renal dehydropeptidase inhibitor that limits the renal metabolism of imipenem. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Intravenous infusion of Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection (I.V.) over 20 minutes results in peak plasma levels of imipenem antimicrobial activity that range from 21 to 58 mcg/mL for the 500 mg dose, and from 41 to 83 mcg/mL for the 1,000 mg dose. At these doses, plasma levels of imipenem antimicrobial activity decline to below 1 mcg/mL or less in 4 to 6 hours. Peak plasma levels of cilastatin following a 20-minute intravenous infusion of Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection (I.V.) range from 31 to 49 mcg/mL for the 500 mg dose, and from 56 to 88 mcg/mL for the 1,000 mg dose. Distribution The binding of imipenem to human serum proteins is approximately 20% and that of cilastatin is approximately 40%. Imipenem has been shown to penetrate into human tissues, including vitreous humor, aqueous humor, lung, peritoneal fluid, CSF, bone, interstitial fluid, skin, and fascia. As there are no adequate and well-controlled studies of imipenem treatment in these additional body sites, the clinical significance of these tissue concentration data is unknown. After a 1 gram dose of Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection (I.V.), the following average levels of imipenem were measured (usually at 1 hour post dose except where indicated) in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 9 : Table 9: Average Levels of Imipenem Tissue or Fluid N Imipenem Level mcg/mL or mcg/g Range Vitreous Humor 3 3.4 (3.5 hours post dose) 2.88 to 3.6 Aqueous Humor 5 2.99 (2 hours post dose) 2.4 to 3.9 Lung Tissue 8 5.6 (median) 3.5 to 15.5 Sputum 1 2.1 \u2014 Pleural 1 22 \u2014 Peritoneal 12 23.9 S.D.\u00b15.3 (2 hours post dose) \u2014 Bile 2 5.3 (2.25 hours post dose) 4.6 to 6 CSF (uninflamed) 5 1 (4 hours post dose) 0.26 to 2 CSF (inflamed) 7 2.6 (2 hours post dose) 0.5 to 5.5 Fallopian Tubes 1 13.6 \u2014 Endometrium 1 11.1 \u2014 Myometrium 1 5 \u2014 Bone 10 2.6 0.4 to 5.4 Interstitial Fluid 12 16.4 10 to 22.6 Skin 12 4.4 NA Fascia 12 4.4 NA Metabolism Imipenem, when administered alone, is metabolized in the kidneys by dehydropeptidase I, resulting in relatively low levels in urine. Cilastatin, an inhibitor of this enzyme, effectively prevents renal metabolism of imipenem so that when imipenem and cilastatin sodium are given concomitantly, adequate antibacterial levels of imipenem are achieved in the urine. Elimination The plasma half-life of each component is approximately 1 hour. Approximately 70% of the administered imipenem is recovered in the urine within 10 hours after which no further urinary excretion is detectable. Urine concentrations of imipenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL can be maintained for up to 8 hours with Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection (I.V.) at the 500 mg dose. Approximately 70% of the cilastatin sodium dose is recovered in the urine within 10 hours of administration of Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection (I.V.). Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection (I.V.) is hemodialyzable [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . No accumulation of imipenem/cilastatin in plasma or urine is observed with regimens administered as frequently as every 6 hours in patients with normal renal function. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In healthy elderly volunteers (65 to 75 years of age with normal renal function for their age), the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of imipenem 500 mg and cilastatin 500 mg administered intravenously over 20 minutes are consistent with those expected in subjects with slight renal impairment for which no dosage alteration is considered necessary. The mean plasma half-lives of imipenem and cilastatin are 91 \u00b1 7 minutes and 69 \u00b1 15 minutes, respectively. Multiple dosing has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either imipenem or cilastatin, and no accumulation of imipenem/cilastatin is observed. Pediatric Patients Doses of 25 mg/kg/dose in patients 3 months to < 3 years of age, and 15 mg/kg/dose in patients 3 to 12 years of age were associated with mean trough plasma concentrations of imipenem of 1.1\u00b10.4 mcg/mL and 0.6\u00b10.2 mcg/mL following multiple 60-minute infusions, respectively; trough urinary concentrations of imipenem were in excess of 10 mcg/mL for both doses. These doses have provided adequate plasma and urine concentrations for the treatment of non-CNS infections. In a dose-ranging study of smaller premature infants (670 to 1,890 g) in the first week of life, a dose of 20 mg/kg q12h by 15 to 30 minutes infusion was associated with mean peak and trough plasma imipenem concentrations of 43 mcg/mL and 1.7 mcg/mL after multiple doses, respectively. However, moderate accumulation of cilastatin in neonates may occur following multiple doses of Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection (I.V.). The safety of this accumulation is unknown. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection (I.V.) is a combination of imipenem and cilastatin. The bactericidal activity of imipenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Its greatest affinity is for penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) 1A, 1B, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of Escherichia coli , and 1A, 1B, 2, 4 and 5 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The lethal effect is related to binding to PBP 2 and PBP 1B. Imipenem has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases produced by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It is a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamases from certain Gram-negative bacteria which are inherently resistant to most beta-lactam antibacterials, e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Serratia spp., and Enterobacter spp. Resistance Imipenem is inactive in vitro against Enterococcus faecium , Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and some isolates of Burkholderia cepacia . Methicillin-resistant staphylococci should be reported as resistant to imipenem. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show imipenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterials against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Imipenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] .

The sodium salts of amobarbital, pentobarbital, phenobarbital, and secobarbital are available as sterile parenteral solutions. Barbiturates are substituted pyrimidine derivatives in which the basic structure common to these drugs is barbituric acid, a substance which has no central nervous system (CNS) activity.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Barbiturates are capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration from excitation to mild sedation, to hypnosis, and deep coma. Overdosage can produce death. In high enough therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia. Barbiturates depress the sensory cortex, decrease motor activity, alter cerebellar function, and produce drowsiness, sedation, and hypnosis. Barbiturate-induced sleep differs from physiological sleep. Sleep laboratory studies have demonstrated that barbiturates reduce the amount of time spent in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase of sleep or dreaming stage. Also, Stages III and IV sleep are decreased. Following abrupt cessation of barbiturates used regularly, patients may experience markedly increased dreaming, nightmares, and/or insomnia. Therefore, withdrawal of a single therapeutic dose over 5 or 6 days has been recommended to lessen the REM rebound and disturbed sleep which contribute to drug withdrawal syndrome (for example, decrease the dose from 3 to 2 doses a day for 1 week). In studies, secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium have been found to lose most of their effectiveness for both inducing and maintaining sleep by the end of 2 weeks of continued drug administration at fixed doses. The short-, intermediate-, and, to a lesser degree, long-acting barbiturates have been widely prescribed for treating insomnia. Although the clinical literature abounds with claims that the short-acting barbiturates are superior for producing sleep while the intermediate-acting compounds are more effective in maintaining sleep, controlled studies have failed to demonstrate these differential effects. Therefore, as sleep medications, the barbiturates are of limited value beyond short-term use. Barbiturates have little analgesic action at subanesthetic doses. Rather, in subanesthetic doses these drugs may increase the reaction to painful stimuli. All barbiturates exhibit anticonvulsant activity in anesthetic doses. However, of the drugs in this class, only phenobarbital, mephobarbital, and metharbital have been clinically demonstrated to be effective as oral anticonvulsants in subhypnotic doses. Barbiturates are respiratory depressants. The degree of respiratory depression is dependent upon dose. With hypnotic doses, respiratory depression produced by barbiturates is similar to that which occurs during physiologic sleep with slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. Studies in laboratory animals have shown that barbiturates cause reduction in the tone and contractility of the uterus, ureters, and urinary bladder. However, concentrations of the drugs required to produce this effect in humans are not reached with sedative-hypnotic doses. Barbiturates do not impair normal hepatic function, but have been shown to induce liver microsomal enzymes, thus increasing and/or altering the metabolism of barbiturates and other drugs. (See \u201c Precautions-Drug Interactions \u201d section). Pharmacokinetics: Barbiturates are absorbed in varying degrees following oral, rectal, or parenteral administration. The salts are more rapidly absorbed than are the acids. The onset of action for oral or rectal administration varies from 20 to 60 minutes. For IM administration, the onset of action is slightly faster. Following IV administration, the onset of action ranges from almost immediately for pentobarbital sodium to 5 minutes for phenobarbital sodium. Maximal CNS depression may not occur until 15 minutes or more after IV administration for phenobarbital sodium. Duration of action, which is related to the rate at which the barbiturates are redistributed throughout the body, varies among persons and in the same person from time to time. No studies have demonstrated that the different routes of administration are equivalent with respect to bioavailability. Barbiturates are weak acids that are absorbed and rapidly distributed to all tissues and fluids with high concentrations in the brain, liver, and kidneys. Lipid solubility of the barbiturates is the dominant factor in their distribution within the body. The more lipid soluble the barbiturate, the more rapidly it penetrates all tissues of the body. Barbiturates are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree with the degree of binding increasing directly as a function of lipid solubility. Phenobarbital has the lowest lipid solubility, lowest plasma binding, lowest brain protein binding, the longest delay in onset of activity, and the longest duration of action. At the opposite extreme is secobarbital which has the highest lipid solubility, plasma protein binding, brain protein binding, the shortest delay in onset of activity, and the shortest duration of action. Butabarbital is classified as an intermediate barbiturate. The plasma half-life for pentobarbital in adults is 15 to 50 hours and appears to be dose dependent. Barbiturates are metabolized primarily by the hepatic microsomal enzyme system, and the metabolic products are excreted in the urine, and less commonly, in the feces. Approximately 25 to 50 percent of a dose of aprobarbital or phenobarbital is eliminated unchanged in the urine, whereas the amount of other barbiturates excreted unchanged in the urine is negligible. The excretion of unmetabolized barbiturate is one feature that distinguishes the long-acting category from those belonging to other categories which are almost entirely metabolized. The inactive metabolites of the barbiturates are excreted as conjugates of glucuronic acid."], "manufacturer_name": ["Akorn"], "substance_name": ["PENTOBARBITAL SODIUM"], "effective_time": "20240201", "product_ndc": ["17478-181"], "brand_name": ["Pentobarbital Sodium"]}

Clofarabine has affinity for the activating phosphorylating enzyme, deoxycytidine kinase, equal to or greater than that of the natural substrate, deoxycytidine. Clofarabine inhibits DNA synthesis by decreasing cellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools through an inhibitory action on ribonucleotide reductase, and by terminating DNA chain elongation and inhibiting repair through incorporation into the DNA chain by competitive inhibition of DNA polymerases. The affinity of clofarabine triphosphate for these enzymes is similar to or greater than that of deoxyadenosine triphosphate. In preclinical models, clofarabine has demonstrated the ability to inhibit DNA repair by incorporation into the DNA chain during the repair process. Clofarabine 5\u2019-triphosphate also disrupts the integrity of mitochondrial membrane, leading to the release of the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor, leading to programmed cell death. Clofarabine is cytotoxic to rapidly proliferating and quiescent cancer cell types in vitro . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The population pharmacokinetics of clofarabine were studied in 40 pediatric patients aged 2 to 19 years (21 males/19 females) with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). At the given 52 mg/m 2 dose, similar concentrations were obtained over a wide range of body surface areas (BSAs). Clofarabine was 47% bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to albumin. Based on non-compartmental analysis, systemic clearance and volume of distribution at steady-state were 28.8 L/h/m 2 and 172 L/m 2 , respectively. The terminal half-life was 5.2 hours. No apparent difference in pharmacokinetics was observed between patients with ALL and AML or between males and females. No relationship between clofarabine or clofarabine triphosphate exposure and toxicity or response was found in this population. Based on 24-hour urine collections in the pediatric studies, 49% to 60% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged. In vitro studies using isolated human hepatocytes indicate very limited metabolism (0.2%). The pathways of non-hepatic elimination remain unknown. Clofarabine has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Drug-Drug Interactions In vitro studies suggested that clofarabine undergoes limited metabolism and does not inhibit or induce major CYP enzymes.

Amiodarone Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Amiodarone is generally considered a class III antiarrhythmic drug, but it possesses electrophysiologic characteristics of all four Vaughan Williams classes. Like class I drugs, amiodarone blocks sodium channels at rapid pacing frequencies, and like class II drugs, amiodarone exerts a noncompetitive antisympathetic action. One of its main effects, with prolonged administration, is to lengthen the cardiac action potential, a class III effect. The negative chronotropic effect of amiodarone in nodal tissues is similar to the effect of class IV drugs. In addition to blocking sodium channels, amiodarone blocks myocardial potassium channels, which contributes to slowing of conduction and prolongation of refractoriness. The antisympathetic action and the block of calcium and potassium channels are responsible for the negative dromotropic effects on the sinus node and for the slowing of conduction and prolongation of refractoriness in the atrioventricular (AV) node. Its vasodilatory action can decrease cardiac workload and consequently myocardial oxygen consumption. Intravenous amiodarone administration prolongs intranodal conduction (Atrial-His, AH) and refractoriness of the atrioventricular node (ERP AVN), but has little or no effect on sinus cycle length (SCL), refractoriness of the right atrium and right ventricle (ERP RA and ERP RV), repolarization (QTc), intraventricular conduction (QRS), and infra-nodal conduction (His-ventricular, HV). A comparison of the electrophysiologic effects of intravenous amiodarone and oral amiodarone is shown in the table below. Table 6: EFFECTS OF INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL AMIODARONE ON ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC PARAMETERS Formulation SCL QRS QTc AH HV ERP RA ERP RV ERP AVN \u2194 No change Intravenous \u2194 \u2194 \u2194 \u2191 \u2194 \u2194 \u2194 \u2191 Oral \u2191 \u2194 \u2191 \u2191 \u2194 \u2191 \u2191 \u2191 At higher doses (> 10 mg/kg) of intravenous amiodarone, prolongation of the ERP RV and modest prolongation of the QRS have been seen. These differences between oral and IV administration suggest that the initial acute effects of intravenous amiodarone may be predominately focused on the AV node, causing an intranodal conduction delay and increased nodal refractoriness due to slow channel blockade (class IV activity) and noncompetitive adrenergic antagonism (class II activity). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Intravenous amiodarone has been reported to produce negative inotropic and vasodilatory effects in animals and humans. In clinical studies of patients with refractory VF or hemodynamically unstable VT, treatment-emergent, drug-related hypotension occurred in 288 of 1836 patients (16%) treated with intravenous amiodarone. No correlations were seen between the baseline ejection fraction and the occurrence of clinically significant hypotension during infusion of intravenous amiodarone. No data are available on the activity of DEA in humans, but in animals, it has significant electrophysiologic and antiarrhythmic effects generally similar to amiodarone itself. DEA's precise role and contribution to the antiarrhythmic activity of oral amiodarone are not certain. The development of maximal ventricular class III effects after oral amiodarone administration in humans correlates more closely with DEA accumulation over time than with amiodarone accumulation. On the other hand, after intravenous amiodarone administration, there is evidence of activity well before significant concentrations of DEA are attained [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Disposition Amiodarone exhibits complex disposition characteristics after intravenous administration. Peak serum concentrations after single 5 mg/kg 15-minute intravenous infusions in healthy subjects range between 5 and 41 mg/L. Peak concentrations after 10-minute infusions of 150 mg intravenous amiodarone in patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF) or hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) range between 7 and 26 mg/L. Due to rapid distribution, serum concentrations decline to 10% of peak values within 30 to 45 minutes after the end of the infusion. In clinical trials, after 48 hours of continued infusions (125, 500 or 1000 mg/day) plus supplemental (150 mg) infusions (for recurrent arrhythmias), amiodarone mean serum concentrations between 0.7 to 1.4 mg/L were observed (n = 260). Metabolism N-desethylamiodarone (DEA) is the major active metabolite of amiodarone in humans. DEA serum concentrations above 0.05 mg/L are not usually seen until after several days of continuous infusion but with prolonged therapy reach approximately the same concentration as amiodarone. Amiodarone is metabolized to DEA by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme group, specifically cytochromes CYP3A and CYP2C8. The CYP3A isoenzyme is present in both the liver and intestines. The highly variable systemic availability of oral amiodarone may be attributed to large interindividual variability in CYP3A activity. Distribution/Elimination From in vitro studies, the protein binding of amiodarone is > 96%. Amiodarone and DEA cross the placenta and both appear in breast milk. Neither amiodarone nor DEA is dialyzable. Amiodarone is eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion and there is negligible excretion of amiodarone or DEA in urine. In studies in healthy subjects following single intravenous administration (5 mg/kg of amiodarone over 15 min), the plasma concentration vs. time profile could be characterized by linear sum of four exponential terms with terminal elimination half-lives (t\u00bd) of 9 to 36 days for amiodarone and 9 - 30 days for DEA. The clearance of amiodarone and DEA ranged between 63 - 231 mL/hr/kg and 140 - 400 mL/hr/kg, respectively. In clinical studies of 2 to 7 days, clearance of amiodarone after intravenous administration in patients with VT and VF ranged between 220 - 440 mL/hr/kg. Special Populations Effect of Age The pharmacokinetics of amiodarone and DEA are affected by age. Normal subjects over 65 years of age show lower clearances (about 100 mL/hr/kg) than younger subjects (about 150 mL/hr/kg) and an increase in t\u00bd from about 20 to 47 days. Effect of Gender Pharmacokinetics of amiodarone and DEA are similar in males and females. Renal Impairment Renal disease does not influence the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone or DEA. Hepatic Impairment After a single dose of intravenous amiodarone to cirrhotic patients, significantly lower C max and average concentration values are seen for DEA, but mean amiodarone levels are unchanged. Cardiac Disease In patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone are not significantly altered but the terminal elimination t\u00bd of DEA is prolonged. Although no dosage adjustment for patients with renal, hepatic, or cardiac abnormalities has been defined during chronic treatment with oral amiodarone, close clinical monitoring is prudent for elderly patients and those with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Exposure-Response There is no established relationship between drug concentration and therapeutic response for short-term intravenous use. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Amiodarone: Cimetidine inhibits CYP3A and can increase serum amiodarone levels. Grapefruit juice given to healthy volunteers increased amiodarone AUC by 50% and Cmax by 84%, resulting in increased plasma levels of amiodarone. Cholestyramine reduces enterohepatic circulation of amiodarone thereby increasing its elimination. This results in reduced amiodarone serum levels and half-life. Effect of Amiodarone on Other Drugs: Amiodarone taken concomitantly with quinidine increases the quinidine serum concentration by 33% after two days. Amiodarone taken concomitantly with procainamide for less than seven days increases plasma concentrations of procainamide and n-acetyl procainamide by 55% and 33%, respectively. Loratadine , a non-sedating antihistaminic, is metabolized primarily by CYP3A and its metabolism can be inhibited by amiodarone. Metabolism of lidocaine can be inhibited by amiodarone. Sinus bradycardia has been reported with oral amiodarone in combination with lidocaine (CYP3A substrate) given for local anesthesia. Seizure, associated with increased lidocaine concentrations, has been reported with concomitant administration of intravenous amiodarone. Amiodarone can inhibit the metabolism of macrolide/ketolide antibiotics (except for azithromycin) and systemic azole antifungal drugs. Amiodarone taken concomitantly with digoxin increases the serum digoxin concentration by 70% after one day. Dextromethorphan is a substrate for both CYP2D6 and CYP3A. Amiodarone inhibits CYP2D6. Chronic (> 2 weeks) oral amiodarone administration impairs metabolism of dextromethorphan can lead to increased serum concentrations. Dabigatran etexilate when taken concomitantly with oral amiodarone can result in elevated serum concentration of dabigatran. Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug , metabolized by CYP450 including CYP3A to an active metabolite. The metabolism of cyclophosphamide may be inhibited by amiodarone. Clopidogrel , an inactive thienopyridine prodrug, is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A to an active metabolite.

Thus, the hydrocarbon is excited by blue light and emits light that appears yellowish green. Following intravenous injection of fluorescein sodium in an aqueous solution, the unbound fraction of the fluorescein can be excited with a blue light flash from a fundus camera as it circulates through the ocular vasculature, and the ye lowish green fluorescence of the dye is captured by the camera. In the fundus, the fluorescence of the dye demarcates the retinal and/or choroidal vasculature under observation, distinguishing it from adjacent areas/structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution. Within 7 to 14 seconds after IV administration into the antecubital vein, fluorescein usually appears in the central retinal artery of the eye. Within a few minutes of IV administration of fluorescein sodium, a ye lowish discoloration of the skin occurs, which begins to fade 6 to 12 hours after dosing.

The absence of a methoxy group at position 4 of the anthracycline structure gives the compound a high lipophilicity which results in an increased rate of cellular uptake compared with other anthracyclines. Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in adult leukemia patients with normal renal and hepatic function following intravenous administration of 10 to 12 mg/m 2 of idarubicin daily for 3 to 4 days as a single agent or combined with cytarabine. The plasma concentrations of idarubicin are best described by a two or three compartment open model. The elimination rate of idarubicin from plasma is slow with an estimated mean terminal half-life of 22 hours (range, 4 to 48 hours) when used as a single agent and 20 hours (range, 7 to 38 hours) when used in combination with cytarabine. The elimination of the primary active metabolite, idarubicinol, is considerably slower than that of the parent drug with an estimated mean terminal half-life that exceeds 45 hours; hence, its plasma levels are sustained for a period greater than 8 days. Distribution The disposition profile shows a rapid distributive phase with a very high volume of distribution presumably reflecting extensive tissue binding. Studies of cellular (nucleated blood and bone marrow cells) drug concentrations in leukemia patients have shown that peak cellular idarubicin concentrations are reached a few minutes after injection. Concentrations of idarubicin and idarubicinol in nucleated blood and bone marrow cells are more than a hundred times the plasma concentrations. Idarubicin disappearance rates in plasma and cells were comparable with a terminal half-life of about 15 hours. The terminal half-life of idarubicinol in cells was about 72 hours. The extent of drug and metabolite accumulation predicted in leukemia patients for Days 2 and 3 of dosing, based on the mean plasma levels and half-life obtained after the first dose, is 1.7- and 2.3-fold, respectively, and suggests no change in kinetics following a daily \u00d7 3 regimen. The percentages of idarubicin and idarubicinol bound to human plasma proteins averaged 97% and 94%, respectively, at concentrations similar to maximum plasma levels obtained in the pharmacokinetic studies. The binding is concentration independent. The plasma clearance is twice the expected hepatic plasma flow indicating extensive extrahepatic metabolism. Metabolism The primary active metabolite formed is idarubicinol. As idarubicinol has cytotoxic activity, it presumably contributes to the effects of idarubicin. Elimination The drug is eliminated predominately by biliary and to a lesser extent by renal excretion, mostly in the form of idarubicinol. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Pediatric Patients Idarubicin studies in pediatric leukemia patients, at doses of 4.2 to 13.3 mg/m 2 /day \u00d7 3, suggest dose independent kinetics. There is no difference between the half-lives of the drug following daily \u00d7 3 or weekly \u00d7 3 administration. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of idarubicin and idarubicinol were measured in pediatric leukemia patients treated intravenously. Idarubicin was detected in 2 of 21 CSF samples (0.14 and 1.57 ng/mL), while idarubicinol was detected in 20 of these 21 CSF samples obtained 18 to 30 hours after dosing (mean = 0.51 ng/mL; range, 0.22 to 1.05 ng/mL). The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Hepatic and Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of idarubicin have not been evaluated in leukemia patients with hepatic impairment. It is expected that in patients with moderate or severe hepatic dysfunction, the metabolism of idarubicin may be impaired and lead to higher systemic drug levels. The disposition of idarubicin may be also affected by renal impairment.

Palonosetron Hydrochloride Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1 SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42 \u00b1 34%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1 SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110 \u00b1 45%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067 \u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4. The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Coadministration of 0.25 mg palonosetron hydrochloride injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction.

Levetiracetam is chemically unrelated to existing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). It has the following structural formula: Levetiracetam is a white to off-white crystalline powder with a faint odor and a bitter taste. It is very soluble in water (104.0 g/100 mL). It is freely soluble in chloroform (65.3 g/100 mL) and in methanol (53.6 g/100 mL), soluble in ethanol (16.5 g/100 mL), sparingly soluble in acetonitrile (5.7 g/100 mL) and practically insoluble in n-hexane.

A saturable and stereoselective neuronal binding site in rat brain tissue has been described for levetiracetam. Experimental data indicate that this binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, thought to be involved in the regulation of vesicle exocytosis. Although the molecular significance of levetiracetam binding to synaptic vesicle protein SV2A is not understood, levetiracetam and related analogs showed a rank order of affinity for SV2A which correlated with the potency of their antiseizure activity in audiogenic seizure-prone mice. These findings suggest that the interaction of levetiracetam with the SV2A protein may contribute to the antiepileptic mechanism of action of the drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on QTc Interval The effect of levetiracetam on QTc prolongation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) and placebo-controlled crossover study of levetiracetam (1,000 mg or 5,000 mg) in 52 healthy subjects. The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc was below 10 milliseconds. Therefore, there was no evidence of significant QTc prolongation in this study. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) levetiracetam and oral levetiracetam result in equivalent C max , C min , and total systemic exposure to levetiracetam when the IV levetiracetam is administered as a 15 minute infusion. Overview Levetiracetam is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. Levetiracetam injection and tablets are bioequivalent. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (<10% bound) and its volume of distribution is close to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam (24% of dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. It is not liver cytochrome P450 dependent. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. Plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6 to 8 hours. It is increased in the elderly (primarily due to impaired renal clearance) and in subjects with renal impairment. Distribution The equivalence of levetiracetam injection and the oral formulation was demonstrated in a bioavailability study of 17 healthy volunteers. In this study, levetiracetam 1,500 mg was diluted in 100 mL 0.9% sterile saline solution and was infused over 15 minutes. The selected infusion rate provided plasma concentrations of levetiracetam at the end of the infusion period similar to those achieved at T max after an equivalent oral dose. It is demonstrated that levetiracetam 1,500 mg intravenous infusion is equivalent to levetiracetam 3 x 500 mg oral tablets. The time independent pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam was demonstrated following 1,500 mg intravenous infusion for 4 days with BID dosing. The AUC (0-12) at steady-state was equivalent to AUC inf following an equivalent single dose. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite are less than 10% bound to plasma proteins; clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are therefore unlikely. Metabolism Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose) and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The major metabolite is inactive in animal seizure models. Two minor metabolites were identified as the product of hydroxylation of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring (2% of dose) and opening of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring in position 5 (1% of dose). There is no enantiomeric interconversion of levetiracetam or its major metabolite. Elimination Levetiracetam plasma half-life in adults is 7 \u00b1 1 hour and is unaffected by either dose, route of administration or repeated administration. Levetiracetam is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug which represents 66% of administered dose. The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The mechanism of excretion is glomerular filtration with subsequent partial tubular reabsorption. The metabolite ucb L057 is excreted by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. Levetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance. Levetiracetam clearance is reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Specific Populations Elderly Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 16 elderly subjects (age 61 to 88 years) with creatinine clearance ranging from 30 to 74 mL/min. Following oral administration of twice-daily dosing for 10 days, total body clearance decreased by 38% and the half-life was 2.5 hours longer in the elderly compared to healthy adults. This is most likely due to the decrease in renal function in these subjects. Pregnancy Levetiracetam levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Gender Levetiracetam C max and AUC were 20% higher in women (N=11) compared to men (N=12). However, clearances adjusted for body weight were comparable. Race Formal pharmacokinetic studies of the effects of race have not been conducted. Cross study comparisons involving Caucasians (N=12) and Asians (N=12), however, show that pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were comparable between the two races. Because levetiracetam is primarily renally excreted and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected. Renal Impairment The disposition of levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with impaired renal function by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50 to 80 mL/min), 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30 to 50 mL/min) and 60% in the severe renal impairment group (CLcr <30 mL/min). Clearance of levetiracetam is correlated with creatinine clearance. In anuric (end stage renal disease) patients, the total body clearance decreased 70% compared to normal subjects (CLcr >80 mL/min). Approximately 50% of the pool of levetiracetam in the body is removed during a standard 4 hour hemodialysis procedure [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Hepatic Impairment In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were unchanged. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), total body clearance was 50% that of normal subjects, but decreased renal clearance accounted for most of the decrease. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions In vitro data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above C max levels achieved within the therapeutic dose range, are neither inhibitors of nor high affinity substrates for human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms, epoxide hydrolase or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes. In addition, levetiracetam does not affect the in vitro glucuronidation of valproic acid. Potential pharmacokinetic interactions of or with levetiracetam were assessed in clinical pharmacokinetic studies (phenytoin, valproate, warfarin, digoxin, oral contraceptive, probenecid) and through pharmacokinetic screening in the placebo-controlled clinical studies in epilepsy patients. Phenytoin Levetiracetam (3,000 mg daily) had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of phenytoin in patients with refractory epilepsy. Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were also not affected by phenytoin. Valproate Levetiracetam (1,500 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of valproate in healthy volunteers. Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption or its plasma clearance or urinary excretion. There also was no effect on exposure to and the excretion of the primary metabolite, ucb L057. Other Antiepileptic Drugs Potential drug interactions between levetiracetam and other AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and valproate) were also assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these AEDs during placebo-controlled clinical studies. These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs and that these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. Oral Contraceptives Levetiracetam (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, or of the luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. Digoxin Levetiracetam (1,000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (ECG) of digoxin given as a 0.25 mg dose every day. Coadministration of digoxin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. Warfarin Levetiracetam (1,000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of R and S warfarin. Prothrombin time was not affected by levetiracetam. Coadministration of warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. Probenecid Probenecid, a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, administered at a dose of 500 mg four times a day, did not change the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam 1,000 mg twice daily. C ssmax of the metabolite, ucb L057, was approximately doubled in the presence of probenecid while the fraction of drug excreted unchanged in the urine remained the same. Renal clearance of ucb L057 in the presence of probenecid decreased 60%, probably related to competitive inhibition of tubular secretion of ucb L057. The effect of levetiracetam on probenecid was not studied."], "manufacturer_name": ["Dr.Reddy's Laboratories Inc"], "substance_name": ["LEVETIRACETAM"], "effective_time": "20211231", "product_ndc": ["43598-635", "43598-636", "43598-637"], "brand_name": ["Levetiracetam"]}

Atropine Sulfate Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and C max by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2 to 4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid.

It has been demonstrated that furosemide inhibits primarily the reabsorption of sodium and chloride not only in the proximal and distal tubules but also in the loop of Henle. The high degree of efficacy is largely due to this unique site of action. The action on the distal tubule is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone. Recent evidence suggests that furosemide glucuronide is the only or at least the major biotransformation product of furosemide in man. Furosemide is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. Plasma concentrations ranging from 1 to 400 \u03bcg/mL are 91 to 99% bound in healthy individuals. The unbound fraction averages 2.3 to 4.1% at therapeutic concentrations. The onset of diuresis following intravenous administration is within 5 minutes and somewhat later after intramuscular administration. The peak effect occurs within the first half hour. The duration of diuretic effect is approximately 2 hours. In fasted normal men, the mean bioavailability of furosemide from furosemide tablets and furosemide oral solution is 64% and 60%, respectively, of that from an intravenous injection of the drug. Although furosemide is more rapidly absorbed from the oral solution (50 minutes) than from the tablet (87 minutes), peak plasma levels and area under the plasma concentration-time curves do not differ significantly. Peak plasma concentrations increase with increasing dose but times-to-peak do not differ among doses. The terminal half-life of furosemide is approximately 2 hours. Significantly more furosemide is excreted in urine following the intravenous injection than after the tablet or oral solution. There are no significant differences between the two oral formulations in the amount of unchanged drug excreted in urine.

The renal clearance of furosemide after intravenous administration in older healthy male subjects (60 to 70 years of age) is statistically significantly smaller than in younger healthy male subjects (20 to 35 years of age).

It reduces impulse conduction velocity in the atria, His-Purkinje fibers, and ventricular muscle, but has variable effects on the atrioventricular (A-V) node, a direct slowing action and a weaker vagolytic effect which may speed A-V conduction slightly. Myocardial excitability is reduced in the atria, Purkinje fibers, papillary muscles, and ventricles by an increase in the threshold for excitation, combined with inhibition of ectopic pacemaker activity by retardation of the slow phase of diastolic depolarization, thus decreasing automaticity especially in ectopic sites. Contractility of the undamaged heart is usually not affected by therapeutic concentrations, although slight reduction of cardiac output may occur, and may be significant in the presence of myocardial damage. Therapeutic levels of PA may exert vagolytic effects and produce slight acceleration of heart rate, while high or toxic concentrations may prolong A-V conduction time or induce A-V block, or even cause abnormal automaticity and spontaneous firing by unknown mechanisms. The electrocardiogram may reflect these effects by showing slight sinus tachycardia (due to the anticholinergic action) and widened QRS complexes and, less regularly, prolonged Q-T and P-R intervals (due to longer systole and slower conduction), as well as some decrease in QRS and T wave amplitude. These direct effects of PA on electrical activity, conduction, responsiveness, excitability and automaticity are characteristic of a Group 1A antiarrhythmic agent, the prototype for which is quinidine; PA effects are very similar. However, PA has weaker vagal blocking action than does quinidine, does not induce alpha-adrenergic blockade, and is less depressing to cardiac contractility. Following intramuscular injection, procainamide is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, and plasma levels peak in 15 to 60 minutes, considerably faster than orally administered procainamide hydrochloride tablets or capsules which produce peak plasma levels in 90 to 120 minutes. Intravenous administration of Procainamide Hydrochloride Injection can produce therapeutic procainamide levels within minutes after infusion is started. About 15 to 20 percent of PA is reversibly bound to plasma proteins, and considerable amounts are more slowly and reversibly bound to tissues of the heart, liver, lung, and kidney. The apparent volume of distribution eventually reaches about 2 liters per kilogram body weight with a half-time of approximately five minutes. While PA has been shown in the dog to cross the blood-brain barrier, it did not concentrate in the brain at levels higher than in plasma. It is not known if PA crosses the placenta. Plasma esterases are far less active in hydrolysis of PA than of procaine. The half-time for elimination of PA is three to four hours in patients with normal renal function, but reduced creatinine clearance and advancing age each prolong the half-time of elimination of PA. A significant fraction of the circulating PA may be metabolized in hepatocytes to N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA), ranging from 16 to 21 percent of an administered dose in \"slow acetylators\" to 24 to 33 percent in \"fast-acetylators\". Since NAPA also has significant antiarrhythmic activity and somewhat slower renal clearance than PA, both hepatic acetylation rate capability and renal function, as well as age, have significant effects on the effective biologic half-time of therapeutic action of administered PA and the NAPA derivative. Trace amounts may be excreted in the urine as free and conjugated \u03c1-aminobenzoic acid, 30 to 60 percent as unchanged PA, and 6 to 52 percent as the NAPA derivative. Both PA and NAPA are eliminated by active tubular secretion as well as by glomerular filtration. Action of PA on the central nervous system is not prominent, but high plasma concentrations may cause tremors. While therapeutic plasma levels for PA have been reported to be 3 to 10 mcg/mL certain patients such as those with sustained ventricular tachycardia, may need higher levels for adequate control.

The drop is caused by slower absorption, as compared to oral administration, because of the poor water solubility of phenytoin. Intravenous administration is the preferred route for producing rapid therapeutic serum levels. Patients stabilized on a daily oral regimen of phenytoin experience a drop in peak blood levels to 50 to 60 percent of stable levels if crossed over to an equal dose administered intramuscularly. However, the intramuscular depot of poorly soluble material is eventually absorbed, as determined by urinary excretion of 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), the principal metabolite, as well as the total amount of drug eventually appearing in the blood. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. A short-term (one week) study indicates that patients do not experience the expected drop in blood levels when crossed over to the intramuscular route if the phenytoin IM dose is increased by 50 percent over the previously established oral dose. To avoid drug accumulation caused by absorption from the muscle depots, it is recommended that for the first week back on oral phenytoin, the dose be reduced to half of the original oral dose (one-third of the IM dose). Experience for periods greater than one week is lacking and blood level monitoring is recommended. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs most often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Elimination The serum half-life in man after intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. S e x /Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. P regnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin.

In addition, vasopressin stimulates antidiuresis via stimulation of V 2 receptors which are coupled to adenyl cyclase. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics At therapeutic doses exogenous vasopressin elicits a vasoconstrictive effect in most vascular beds including the splanchnic, renal and cutaneous circulation. In addition, vasopressin at pressor doses triggers contractions of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract mediated by muscular V 1 -receptors and release of prolactin, ACTH and catecholamines via V 3 receptors. At lower concentrations typical for the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin inhibits water diuresis via renal V 2 receptors. In addition, vasopressin has been demonstrated to cause vasodilation in numerous vascular beds that is mediated by V 2 , V 3 , oxytocin and purinergic P2 receptors. In patients with vasodilatory shock, vasopressin in therapeutic doses increases systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial blood pressure and reduces the dose requirements for norepinephrine. Vasopressin tends to decrease heart rate and cardiac output. The pressor effect is proportional to the infusion rate of exogenous vasopressin. The pressor effect reaches its peak within 15 minutes. After stopping the infusion, the pressor effect fades within 20 minutes. There is no evidence for tachyphylaxis or tolerance to the pressor effect of vasopressin in patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Vasopressin plasma concentrations increase linearly with increasing infusion rates from 10 microunits/kg/min to 200 microunits/kg/min. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 30 minutes of continuous intravenous infusion. Distribution Vasopressin does not appear to bind plasma protein. The volume of distribution is 140 mL/kg.

The apparent t 1/2 of vasopressin at these levels is \u226410 minutes. Metabolism Serine protease, carboxipeptidase and disulfide oxido-reductase cleave vasopressin at sites relevant for the pharmacological activity of the hormone. Thus, the generated metabolites are not expected to retain important pharmacological activity.

This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. Paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or \"bundles\" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/m 2 (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage) were determined in clinical studies. Dose levels of mg/m 2 refer to mg of paclitaxel in paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound). Following intravenous administration of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) to patients with solid tumors, paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner, the initial rapid decline representing distribution to the peripheral compartment and the slower second phase representing drug elimination. Following paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) infusion, paclitaxel exhibited linear drug exposure (AUC) across clinical doses ranging from 80 to 300 mg/m 2 (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage). The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) were independent of the duration of intravenous administration. The pharmacokinetic data of 260 mg/m 2 paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) administered over a 30-minute infusion was compared to the pharmacokinetics of 175 mg/m 2 paclitaxel injection over a 3-hour infusion. Clearance was larger (43%) and the volume of distribution was higher (53%) for paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) than for paclitaxel injection. There were no differences in terminal half-lives. Distribution Following paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) administration to patients with solid tumors, paclitaxel is evenly distributed into blood cells and plasma and is highly bound to plasma proteins (94%). The total volume of distribution is approximately 1741 L; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding of paclitaxel. In a within-patient comparison study, the fraction of unbound paclitaxel in plasma was significantly higher with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) (6.2%) than with solvent-based paclitaxel (2.3%). This contributes to significantly higher exposure to unbound paclitaxel with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) compared with solvent-based paclitaxel, when the total exposure is comparable. In vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins, using paclitaxel concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 \u00b5g/mL, indicated that the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel. Elimination At the clinical dose range of 80 to 300 mg/m 2 (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage), the mean total clearance of paclitaxel ranges from 13 to 30 L/h/m 2 and the mean terminal half-life ranges from 13 to 27 hours.

In vitro , the metabolism of paclitaxel to 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel was inhibited by a number of agents (ketoconazole, verapamil, diazepam, quinidine, dexamethasone, cyclosporin, teniposide, etoposide, and vincristine), but the concentrations used exceeded those found in vivo following normal therapeutic doses. Testosterone, 17\u03b1-ethinyl estradiol, retinoic acid, and quercetin, a specific inhibitor of CYP2C8, also inhibited the formation of 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel in vitro . The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel may also be altered in vivo as a result of interactions with compounds that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A4 [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Excretion After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg/m 2 doses of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound), the mean values for cumulative urinary recovery of unchanged drug (4%) indicated extensive non-renal clearance. Less than 1% of the total administered dose was excreted in urine as the metabolites 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3'- p -hydroxypaclitaxel. Fecal excretion was approximately 20% of the total dose administered. Specific Populations No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) were observed based on body weight (40 to 143 kg), body surface area (1.3 to 2.4 m 2 ), sex, race (Asian vs. White), age (24 to 85 years), type of solid tumors, mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to <90 mL/min), and mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1 to \u22641.5 x ULN and AST \u226410 x ULN). Patients with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 x ULN and AST \u226410 x ULN) or severe (total bilirubin >3 to 5 x ULN) hepatic impairment had a 22% to 26% decrease in the maximum elimination rate of paclitaxel and approximately 20% increase in mean paclitaxel AUC compared with patients with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin \u2264ULN and AST \u2264ULN) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . The effect of severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) on the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Carboplatin: Administration of carboplatin immediately after the completion of the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) infusion to patients with NSCLC did not cause clinically meaningful changes in paclitaxel exposure. The observed mean AUC inf of free carboplatin was approximately 23% higher than the targeted value (6 min*mg/mL), but its mean half-life and clearance were consistent with those reported in the absence of paclitaxel."], "manufacturer_name": ["Apotex Corp."], "substance_name": ["PACLITAXEL"], "effective_time": "20220401", "product_ndc": ["60505-6230"], "brand_name": ["Paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)"]}

Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action has not been fully characterized. However, cross-linking of tumor cell DNA may be involved. The active alkylating metabolites of cyclophosphamide interfere with the growth of susceptible rapidly proliferating malignant cells. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cyclophosphamide exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic response have not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug. Cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics are linear over the approved recommended dose range. Distribution The volume of distribution of cyclophosphamide is 30 to 50 L. Cyclophosphamide is approximately 20% protein bound, with no dose dependent changes. Some metabolites are greater than 60% protein bound. Elimination The elimination half-life (t\u00bd) of cyclophosphamide ranges from 3 to 12 hours, and clearance (CL) ranges from 4 to 5.6 L/h. When cyclophosphamide was administered at 4 g/m2 (approximately 2 times the approved recommended dosage) over a 90-minute infusion, concentration-time data demonstrate saturable elimination in parallel with first-order renal elimination. Metabolism Cyclophosphamide is metabolized by cytochrome P450s including CYP2A6, 2B6, 3A, 2C9, and 2C19. Cyclophosphamide is activated to form 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, which is in equilibrium with its ring-open tautomer aldophosphamide. 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and aldophosphamide can undergo oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenases to form the inactive metabolites 4--ketocyclophosphamide and carboxyphosphamide, respectively. Aldophosphamide can undergo \u03b2-elimination to form inactive metabolites phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. This spontaneous conversion can be catalyzed by albumin and other proteins. At high doses, the fraction of parent compound cleared by 4-hydroxylation is reduced resulting in non-linear elimination of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide appears to induce its own metabolism. This auto-induction results in an increase in CL, increased formation of active 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and shortened t\u00bd following multiple doses administered at 12-to 24-hour interval. Excretion Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites are eliminated by hepatic and renal pathways. Cyclophosphamide is primarily excreted as metabolites. Ten to 20% is excreted unchanged in the urine. A small percentage of cyclophosphamide may be eliminated unchanged in bile. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Following one-hour intravenous infusion, cyclophosphamide AUC increased by 38% in patients with CLcr of 25 to 50 mL/min, by 77% in patients with CLcr of 10 to 24 mL/min and by 23% in the hemodialysis group (CLcr of< 10 mL/min) compared to the control group (CLcr\u2265 80 mL/min). Cyclophosphamide is dialyzable. Dialysis clearance averaged 104 mL/min, which is similar to the metabolic clearance of 95 mL/min for cyclophosphamide. A mean of 37% of the administered dose of cyclophosphamide was removed during a 4-hour hemodialysis period. The t\u00bd was 3.3 hours in patients during hemodialysis, a 49% reduction compared to t\u00bd of 6.5 hours in uremic patients. Hepatic Impairment Cyclophosphamide CL is decreased by 40% (45 \u00b1 8.6 L/kg) and t\u00bd is prolonged by 64% (12.5 \u00b1 1 hours) in patients with hepatic impairment with a mean bilirubin 3.5 mg/dL and mean AST 90 IU/L compared to patients with normal hepatic function (mean bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, mean AST 10 IU/L)."], "manufacturer_name": ["BluePoint Laboratories"], "substance_name": ["CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE ANHYDROUS"], "effective_time": "20241119", "product_ndc": ["68001-564", "68001-563", "68001-565"], "brand_name": ["CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE"]}

Peak serum concentrations of tobramycin occur between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration. Following an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, maximum serum concentrations reach about 4 mcg/mL, and measurable levels persist for as long as 8 hours. Therapeutic serum levels are generally considered to range from 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When tobramycin is administered by intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. Tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with normal renal function, except neonates, tobramycin administered every 8 hours does not accumulate in the serum. However, in those patients with reduced renal function and in neonates, the serum concentration of the antibiotic is usually higher and can be measured for longer periods of time than in normal adults. Dosage for such patients must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs, and tobramycin is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Renal clearance is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Ultrafiltration studies demonstrate that practically no serum protein binding occurs. In patients with normal renal function, up to 84% of the dose is recoverable from the urine in 8 hours and up to 93% in 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations ranging from 75 to 100 mcg/mL have been observed following the intramuscular injection of a single dose of 1 mg/kg. After several days of treatment, the amount of tobramycin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. When renal function is impaired, excretion of tobramycin is slowed, and accumulation of the drug may cause toxic blood levels. The serum half-life in normal individuals is 2 hours. An inverse relationship exists between serum half-life and creatinine clearance, and the dosage schedule should be adjusted according to the degree of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In patients undergoing dialysis, 25% to 70% of the administered dose may be removed, depending on the duration and type of dialysis. Tobramycin can be detected in tissues and body fluids after parenteral administration. Concentrations in bile and stools ordinarily have been low, which suggests minimum biliary excretion. Tobramycin has appeared in low concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid following parenteral administration, and concentrations are dependent on dose, rate of penetration, and degree of meningeal inflammation. It has also been found in sputum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and abscess fluids, and it crosses the placental membranes. Concentrations in the renal cortex are several times higher than the usual serum levels. Probenecid does not affect the renal tubular transport of tobramycin. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal. Resistance Aminoglycosides are generally not active against most gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci. Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur. Interactions with Other Antibacterial Drugs In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis. However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g., Enterococcus faecium. Species-level identification of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism must be performed. Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in INDICATIONS AND USAGE section (1): Aerobic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria Citrobacter species Enterobacter species Escherichia coli Klebsiella species Morganella morganii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia species Serratia species Aminoglycosides are generally not active against most gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci. For Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp., aminoglycosides may appear active in vitro but are not effective clinically and should not be reported as susceptible. Susceptibility Test Methods When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug product for treatment. Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antibacterial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method 1,3 . Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tobramycin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 1. Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antibacterial compounds.

A report of \"Susceptible\" indicates that the antimicrobial is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentration at the infection site necessary to inhibit growth of the pathogen. A report of \"Intermediate\" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of \"Resistant\" indicates that the antimicrobial is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected.

{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE Amikacin Sulfate Injection is indicated in the short-term treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas species, Escherichia coli , species of indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus , Providencia species, Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia species, and Acinetobacter ( Mima-Herellea ) species. Clinical studies have shown Amikacin Sulfate Injection to be effective in bacterial septicemia (including neonatal sepsis); in serious infections of the respiratory tract, bones and joints, central nervous system (including meningitis) and skin and soft tissue; intra-abdominal infections (including peritonitis); and in burns and post-operative infections (including post-vascular surgery). Clinical studies have shown amikacin also to be effective in serious complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections due to these organisms. Aminoglycosides, including Amikacin Sulfate Injection are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Bacteriologic studies should be performed to identify causative organisms and their susceptibilities to amikacin. Amikacin may be considered as initial therapy in suspected Gram-negative infections and therapy may be instituted before obtaining the results of susceptibility testing. Clinical trials demonstrated that amikacin was effective in infections caused by gentamicin- and/or tobramycin-resistant strains of Gram-negative organisms, particularly Proteus rettgeri , Providencia stuartii , Serratia marcescens , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The decision to continue therapy with the drug should be based on results of the susceptibility tests, the severity of the infection, the response of the patient and the important additional considerations contained in the WARNINGS box above. Amikacin has also been shown to be effective in staphylococcal infections and may be considered as initial therapy under certain conditions in the treatment of known or suspected staphylococcal disease such as, severe infections where the causative organism may be either a Gram-negative bacterium or a staphylococcus, infections due to susceptible strains of staphylococci in patients allergic to other antibiotics, and in mixed staphylococci/Gram-negative infections. In certain severe infections such as neonatal sepsis, concomitant therapy with a penicillin-type drug may be indicated because of the possibility of infections due to Gram-positive organisms such as streptococci or pneumococci. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amikacin and other antibacterial drugs, amikacin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

In normal adult volunteers, average peak serum concentrations of about 12, 16, and 21 mcg/mL are obtained 1 hour after intramuscular administration of 250 mg (3.7 mg/kg), 375 mg (5 mg/kg), 500 mg (7.5 mg/kg), single doses, respectively. At 10 hours, serum levels are about 0.3 mcg/mL, 1.2 mcg/mL, and 2.1 mcg/mL, respectively. Tolerance studies in normal volunteers reveal that amikacin is well tolerated locally following repeated intramuscular dosing, and when given at maximally recommended doses, no ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity has been reported. There is no evidence of drug accumulation with repeated dosing for 10 days when administered according to recommended doses. With normal renal function, about 91.9% of an intramuscular dose is excreted unchanged in the urine in the first 8 hours, and 98.2% within 24 hours. Mean urine concentrations for 6 hours are 563 mcg/mL following a 250 mg dose, 697 mcg/mL following a 375 mg dose, and 832 mcg/mL following a 500 mg dose. Preliminary intramuscular studies in newborns of different weights (less than 1.5 kg, 1.5 to 2 kg, over 2 kg) at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg revealed that, like other aminoglycosides, serum half-life values were correlated inversely with post-natal age and renal clearances of amikacin. The volume of distribution indicates that amikacin, like other aminoglycosides, remains primarily in the extracellular fluid space of neonates. Repeated dosing every 12 hours in all the above groups did not demonstrate accumulation after 5 days. Intravenous Administration Single doses of 500 mg (7.5 mg/kg) administered to normal adults as an infusion over a period of 30 minutes produced a mean peak serum concentration of 38 mcg/mL at the end of the infusion, and levels of 24 mcg/mL, 18 mcg/mL, and 0.75 mcg/mL at 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 10 hours post-infusion, respectively. Eighty-four percent of the administered dose was excreted in the urine in 9 hours and about 94% within 24 hours. Repeat infusions of 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours in normal adults were well tolerated and caused no drug accumulation. General Pharmacokinetic studies in normal adult subjects reveal the mean serum half-life to be slightly over 2 hours with a mean total apparent volume of distribution of 24 liters (28% of the body weight). By the ultrafiltration technique, reports of serum protein binding range from 0 to 11%. The mean serum clearance rate is about 100 mL/min and the renal clearance rate is 94 mL/min in subjects with normal renal function. Amikacin is excreted primarily by glomerular filtration. Patients with impaired renal function or diminished glomerular filtration pressure excrete the drug much more slowly (effectively prolonging the serum half-life). Therefore, renal function should be monitored carefully and dosage adjusted accordingly (see suggested dosage schedule under DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following administration at the recommended dose, therapeutic levels are found in bone, heart, gallbladder, and lung tissue in addition to significant concentrations in urine, bile, sputum, bronchial secretions, interstitial, pleural, and synovial fluids. Spinal fluid levels in normal infants are approximately 10 to 20% of the serum concentrations and may reach 50% when the meninges are inflamed. Amikacin has been demonstrated to cross the placental barrier and yield significant concentrations in amniotic fluid. The peak fetal serum concentration is about 16% of the peak maternal serum concentration and maternal and fetal serum half-life values are about 2 and 3.7 hours, respectively. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Amikacin, an aminoglycoside, binds to the prokaryotic ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis in susceptible bacteria. It is bactericidal in vitro against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Resistance Aminoglycosides are known to be ineffective against Salmonella and Shigella species in patients. Therefore, in vitro susceptibility test results should not be reported. Amikacin resists degradation by certain aminoglycoside inactivating enzymes known to affect gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin. Aminoglycosides in general have a low order of activity against Gram-positive organisms other than Staphylococcal isolates. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro studies have shown that amikacin sulfate combined with a beta-lactam antibiotic acts synergistically against many clinically significant Gram-negative organisms. Antimicrobial Activity Amikacin has been shown to be active against the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ].

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action ZEMDRI is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The ratio of area under the plasma concentration-time curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC:MIC) for plazomicin has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection against Enterobacteriaceae. Exposure- Response Relationship for Nephrotoxicity in cUTI Patients Based on exposure-response analysis for nephrotoxicity, defined as serum creatinine increases greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/dL from baseline, using the data from two cUTI clinical trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2), development of nephrotoxicity was associated with estimated plazomicin exposure (i.e., the plasma trough concentration [C min ]) in patients with CLcr greater than 30 mL/min and less than or equal to 90 mL/min (N=243). The incidence of nephrotoxicity was higher in patients with plazomicin C min greater than or equal to 3 mcg/mL (36%, 10/28) compared to patients with plazomicin C min less than 3 mcg/mL (5%, 11/215). Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of ZEMDRI on the QTc interval was evaluated in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo and positive controlled, double-blind, single-dose, crossover thorough QTc study in 56 healthy adult subjects. At a single dose of 20 mg/kg (1.3 times the maximum recommended dose), ZEMDRI did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of plazomicin are similar for single- and multiple-dose administration of ZEMDRI in healthy subjects. No appreciable accumulation of plazomicin was observed following multiple IV infusions of 15 mg/kg administered every 24 hours in subjects with normal renal function. The AUC, maximum plasma concentration (C max ), and C min increased in proportion to the dose over the dose range of 4 to 15 mg/kg. The plazomicin AUC, C max , and C min are summarized in Table 4. Table 4: Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Geometric Mean [\u00b1SD]) of Plazomicin Following Administration of ZEMDRI 15 mg/kg by 30-Minute IV Infusion in Healthy Subjects and cUTI Patients with CLcr Greater than or Equal to 90 mL/min Healthy Subjects PK parameters following a single dose of 15 mg/kg; Based on non-compartmental analysis of PK data; AUC 0-inf is reported; C min is concentration at 24 hours.

The average binding of plazomicin to human plasma proteins is approximately 20%. The degree of protein binding was concentration-independent across the range tested in vitro (5 to 100 mcg/mL). Elimination The mean (\u00b1SD) total body clearance of plazomicin in healthy adults and cUTI patients is 4.5 (\u00b10.9) and 5.1 (\u00b12.01) L/h, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life of plazomicin was 3.5 h (\u00b10.5) in healthy adults with normal renal function (n=54). Metabolism Plazomicin does not appear to be metabolized to any appreciable extent. Excretion Plazomicin is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Following a single 15 mg/kg IV dose of radiolabeled plazomicin in healthy subjects, 56% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered in urine within 4 hours, 89.1% was recovered within 168 hours, with less than 0.2% in feces. In total, 97.5% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged plazomicin. The mean renal clearance (\u00b1SD) of plazomicin (4.6 [\u00b11.2] L/h) was similar to total body clearance, suggesting that plazomicin is eliminated by the kidneys. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of plazomicin were observed based on age (18 to 90 years of age), sex, or race/ethnicity. The pharmacokinetics of plazomicin in patients with hepatic impairment is unknown. Patients with Renal Impairment Following a single 7.5 mg/kg IV dose (0.5 times the recommended dose) of ZEMDRI as a 30-minute infusion, the geometric mean AUC 0-inf of plazomicin in subjects with mild (CLcr 60 to <90 mL/min, n=6), moderate (CLcr 30 to <60 mL/min, n=6), and severe (CLcr 15 to <30 mL/min, n=6) renal impairment was 1.01-fold, 1.98-fold, and 4.42-fold higher, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function (CLcr \u226590 mL/min, n=6) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Based on the population PK model, the recommended dosage of ZEMDRI was associated with a mean (\u00b1SD) C min of 1.0 (\u00b11.3) and 1.7 (\u00b11.4) mcg/mL in cUTI patients with mild (CLcr 60 to <90 mL/min, n=104) and moderate (CLcr 30 to <60 mL/min, n=89) renal impairment, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) area under the curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC 0-24h ) was 261 (\u00b1102) and 224 (\u00b1147) mcg\u2219h/mL in cUTI patients with mild (CLcr 60 to <90 mL/min, n=104) and moderate (CLcr 30 to <60 mL/min, n=89) renal impairment, respectively. There were insufficient data to calculate C min and AUC 0-24h for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to <30 mL/min). Geriatric Patients No clinically relevant trend in plazomicin exposure (C max and AUC 0-24h ) was observed with regard to age alone. Higher C min in elderly subjects (65 to 90 years of age) as compared to non-elderly adult subjects (18 to 64 years of age) was mainly attributable to age-related changes in renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Based on the results of a clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study that evaluated the effect of a single dose of plazomicin (15 mg/kg) on the single dose plasma PK of metformin, plazomicin did not affect the PK of metformin, which is a substrate of OCT and MATE transporters. In Vitro Studies Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes Plazomicin does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 isoforms: CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5. Plazomicin does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4. Membrane Transporters Plazomicin is not a substrate of P-gp or BCRP transporters. Plazomicin does not inhibit the following hepatic and renal transporters in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations: P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, and OCT2. Plazomicin selectively inhibited the MATE1 and MATE2-K renal transporter in vitro with an IC 50 value of 1300 and 338 mcg/mL, respectively. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Plazomicin is an aminoglycoside that acts by binding to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. Plazomicin has concentration-dependent bactericidal activity as measured by time kill studies. In vitro studies demonstrated a plazomicin post-antibiotic effect ranging from 0.2 to 2.6 hours at 2\u00d7 MIC against Enterobacteriaceae. Resistance Resistance to aminoglycosides includes production of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs), alteration of the ribosomal target through production of 16S rRNA methyltransferases, up-regulation of efflux pumps and reduced permeability into bacterial cell due to loss of outer membrane porins. Plazomicin is not inhibited by most AMEs known to affect gentamicin, amikacin and tobramycin, including acetyltransferases (AACs), phosphotransferases (APHs) and nucleotidyltransferases (ANTs). Plazomicin, like other aminoglycosides, is inactive against bacterial isolates that produce 16S rRNA methyltransferases. Plazomicin may have reduced activity against Enterobacteriaceae that overexpress certain efflux pumps (e.g., acrAB-tolC ) or lower expression of porins (e.g., ompF or ompK36 ). Plazomicin has no in vitro activity against streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae ), enterococci (including Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium ), anaerobes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter spp and variable activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Activity of plazomicin was demonstrated in vitro against Enterobacteriaceae in the presence of certain beta-lactamases, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM, SHV, CTX-M, AmpC), serine carbapenemases (KPC-2, KPC-3), and oxacillinase (OXA-48). Bacteria producing metallo-beta-lactamases often co-express 16S rRNA methyltransferase, conferring resistance to plazomicin. Interaction With Other Antimicrobials In vitro studies have demonstrated that against Enterobacteriaceae isolates, no antagonism was observed for plazomicin in combination with clindamycin, colistin, daptomycin, fosfomycin, levofloxacin, linezolid, rifampin, tigecycline and vancomycin; few isolates showed synergy with ceftazidime, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Animal Infection Models Plazomicin demonstrated activity in animal models of infection (e.g., thigh infection, lung infection, and septicemia) caused by either amikacin-non-susceptible, gentamicin-non-susceptible, or beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae . Antimicrobial Activity ZEMDRI has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1) ] Aerobic Bacteria Gram-negative Bacteria Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae Proteus mirabilis Enterobacter cloacae The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for plazomicin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of ZEMDRI in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Piperacillin plasma concentrations, following a 30-minute infusion of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection, were similar to those attained when equivalent doses of piperacillin were administered alone. Steady-state plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam were similar to those attained after the first dose due to the short half-lives of piperacillin and tazobactam. Distribution Both piperacillin and tazobactam are approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. The protein binding of either piperacillin or tazobactam is unaffected by the presence of the other compound. Protein binding of the tazobactam metabolite is negligible. Piperacillin and tazobactam are widely distributed into tissues and body fluids including intestinal mucosa, gallbladder, lung, female reproductive tissues (uterus, ovary, and fallopian tube), interstitial fluid, and bile. Mean tissue concentrations are generally 50% to 100% of those in plasma. Distribution of piperacillin and tazobactam into cerebrospinal fluid is low in subjects with non-inflamed meninges, as with other penicillins (see Table 9).

Tazobactam is metabolized to a single metabolite that lacks pharmacological and antibacterial activities. Excretion Following single or multiple piperacillin and tazobactam for injection doses to healthy subjects, the plasma half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 hours and was unaffected by dose or duration of infusion. Both piperacillin and tazobactam are eliminated via the kidney by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Piperacillin is excreted rapidly as unchanged drug with 68% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. Tazobactam and its metabolite are eliminated primarily by renal excretion with 80% of the administered dose excreted as unchanged drug and the remainder as the single metabolite. Piperacillin, tazobactam and desethyl piperacillin are also secreted into the bile. Specific Populations Renal Impairment After the administration of single doses of piperacillin and tazobactam to subjects with renal impairment, the half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. At creatinine clearance below 20 mL/min, the increase in half-life is twofold for piperacillin and fourfold for tazobactam compared to subjects with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments for piperacillin and tazobactam for injection are recommended when creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min in patients receiving the usual recommended daily dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection. See Dosage and Administration (2) for specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with renal\u2011impairment. Hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of a piperacillin and tazobactam dose with an additional 5% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. Peritoneal dialysis removes approximately 6% and 21% of the piperacillin and tazobactam doses, respectively, with up to 16% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. For dosage recommendations for patients undergoing hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Hepatic Impairment The half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases by approximately 25% and 18%, respectively, in patients with hepatic cirrhosis compared to healthy subjects. However, this difference does not warrant dosage adjustment of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection due to hepatic cirrhosis. Pediatrics Piperacillin and tazobactam pharmacokinetics were studied in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older. The clearance of both compounds is slower in the younger patients compared to older children and adults. In a population PK analysis, estimated clearance for 9 month-old to 12 year-old patients was comparable to adults, with a population mean (SE) value of 5.64 (0.34) mL/min/kg. The piperacillin clearance estimate is 80% of this value for pediatric patients 2 - 9 months old. In patients younger than 2 months of age, clearance of piperacillin is slower compared to older children; however, it is not adequately characterized for dosing recommendations. The population mean (SE) for piperacillin volume of distribution is 0.243 (0.011) L/kg and is independent of age. Geriatrics The impact of age on the pharmacokinetics of piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male subjects, aged 18 - 35 years (n=6) and aged 65 to 80 years (n=12). Mean half-life for piperacillin and tazobactam was 32% and 55% higher, respectively, in the elderly compared to the younger subjects. This difference may be due to age-related changes in creatinine clearance. Race The effect of race on piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male volunteers. No difference in piperacillin or tazobactam pharmacokinetics was observed between Asian (n=9) and Caucasian (n=9) healthy volunteers who received single 4/0.5 g doses. Drug Interactions The potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between piperacillin and tazobactam for injection and aminoglycosides, probenecid, vancomycin, heparin, vecuronium, and methotrexate has been evaluated [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Piperacillin sodium exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting septum formation and cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. In vitro, piperacillin is active against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Tazobactam sodium has little clinically relevant in vitro activity against bacteria due to its reduced affinity to penicillin-binding proteins. It is, however, a beta-lactamase inhibitor of the Molecular class A enzymes, including Richmond-Sykes class III (Bush class 2b & 2b') penicillinases and cephalosporinases. It varies in its ability to inhibit class II and IV (2a & 4) penicillinases. Tazobactam does not induce chromosomally\u2011mediated beta-lactamases at tazobactam concentrations achieved with the recommended dosage regimen. Antimicrobial Activity Piperacillin/tazobactam has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1) ]: Aerobic bacteria Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae (excluding beta-lactamase negative, ampicillin-resistant isolates) Klebsiella pneumoniae Pseudomonas aeruginosa (given in combination with an aminoglycoside to which the isolate is susceptible) Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis group ( B. fragilis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, and B. vulgatus ) The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for piperacillin/tazobactam against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of piperacillin and tazobactam in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis, and finally, the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. When this diagnosis is confirmed by peripheral nerve stimulation, it may sometimes be reversed with anticholinesterase drugs such as neostigmine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in seven of seven patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O2/narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery. Anticholinesterase drugs may not always be effective. If given before succinylcholine is metabolized by cholinesterase, anticholinesterase drugs may prolong rather than shorten paralysis. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 and 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and slight increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Succinylcholine may cause slight increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension, and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon in normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold, or cerebration. It should be used only with adequate anesthesia. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. Because it is highly ionized and has low fat solubility, it does not readily cross the placenta. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of ANECTINE in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes, and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including Anectine. Case reports as well as ex-vivo studies have identified multiple variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with MHS. Variant pathogenicity should be assessed based on prior clinical experience, functional studies, prevalence information, or other evidence [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Civica, Inc."], "substance_name": ["SUCCINYLCHOLINE CHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20231129", "product_ndc": ["72572-750"], "brand_name": ["Anectine"]}

Compared to other neuromuscular blockers, it is intermediate in its onset and duration of action.

Cisatracurium besylate is one of 10 isomers of atracurium besylate and constitutes approximately 15% of that mixture. Cisatracurium besylate is [1R- [1\u03b1, 2\u03b1 (1'R*,2'R*)]]-2,2'-[1,5-pentanediylbis[oxy(3-oxo-3,1-propanediyl)]]bis[1-[(3,4- dimethoxyphenyl)methyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-methylisoquinolinium] dibenzenesulfonate.

This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The average ED95 (dose required to produce 95% suppression of the adductor pollicis muscle twitch response to ulnar nerve stimulation) of cisatracurium is 0.05 mg/kg (range: 0.048 to 0.053) in adults receiving opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. The pharmacodynamics of various cisatracurium besylate injection doses administered over 5 to 10 seconds during opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia are summarized in Table 5. When the cisatracurium besylate injection dose is doubled, the clinically effective duration of blockade increases by approximately 25 minutes. Once recovery begins, the rate of recovery is independent of dose. Isoflurane or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC (Minimum Alveolar Concentration) prolonged the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance cisatracurium besylate injection doses, and decreased the average infusion rate requirement of cisatracurium besylate injection. The magnitude of these effects depended on the duration of administration of the volatile agents: \u2022 Fifteen to 30 minutes of exposure to 1.25 MAC isoflurane or enflurane had minimal effects on the duration of action of initial doses of cisatracurium besylate injection. \u2022 In surgical procedures during enflurane or isoflurane anesthesia greater than 30 minutes, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of cisatracurium besylate injection were required. The average infusion rate requirement was decreased by as much as 30% to 40% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. The onset, duration of action, and recovery profiles of cisatracurium besylate injection during propofol/oxygen or propofol/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia were similar to those during opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia (see Table 5). Repeated administration of maintenance cisatracurium besylate injection doses or a continuous cisatracurium besylate injection infusion for up to 3 hours was not associated with development of tachyphylaxis or cumulative neuromuscular blocking effects. The time needed to recover from successive maintenance doses did not change with the number of doses administered when partial recovery occurred between doses. The rate of spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function after cisatracurium besylate injection infusion was independent of the duration of infusion and comparable to the rate of recovery following initial doses (see Table 5). Pediatric patients including infants generally had a shorter time to maximum neuromuscular blockade and a faster recovery from neuromuscular blockade compared to adults treated with the same weight-based doses (see Table 5).

A total of 141 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were administered cisatracurium besylate injection in three active-controlled clinical trials and received doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.4 mg/kg. While the hemodynamic profile was comparable in both the cisatracurium besylate injection and active control groups, data for doses above 0.3 mg/kg in this population are limited. Figure 1.

Doses of 0.15 mg/kg cisatracurium besylate injection administered over 5 seconds were not consistently associated with changes in HR and MAP in pediatric patients aged 1 month to 12 years who received opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen or halothane/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. cisatracurium-spl-map-figure-2 cisatracurium-spl-map-figure-3 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The neuromuscular blocking activity of cisatracurium besylate injection is due to parent drug. Cisatracurium plasma concentration-time data following IV bolus administration are best described by a two-compartment open model (with elimination from both compartments) with an elimination half-life (t \u00bd \u03b2) of 22 minutes, a plasma clearance (CL) of 4.57 mL/min/kg, and a volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of 145 mL/kg. Results from population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses from 241 healthy surgical patients are summarized in Table 6. Table 6. Key Population PK/PD Parameter Estimates for Cisatracurium in Healthy Surgical Patients* Following 0.1 (2 \u00d7 ED 95 ) to 0.4 mg/kg (8 \u00d7 ED 95 ) of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection Parameter Estimate \u2020 Magnitude of Interpatient Variability (CV) \u2021 CL (mL/min/kg) 4.57 16% Vss (mL/kg) \u00a7 145 27% keo (min-1) ll 0.0575 61% EC 50 (ng/mL) \u00b6 141 52% * Healthy male non-obese patients 19-64 years of age with creatinine clearance values greater than 70 mL/minute who received cisatracurium besylate injection during opioid anesthesia and had venous samples collected \u2020 The percent standard error of the mean (%SEM) ranged from 3% to 12% indicating good precision for the PK/PD estimates. \u2021 Expressed as a coefficient of variation; the %SEM ranged from 20% to 35% indicating adequate precision for the estimates of interpatient variability. \u00a7 Vss is the volume of distribution at steady state estimated using a two-compartment model with elimination from both compartments. Vss is equal to the sum of the volume in the central compartment (Vc) and the volume in the peripheral compartment (Vp); interpatient variability could only be estimated for Vc. ll Rate constant describing the equilibration between plasma concentrations and neuromuscular block \u00b6 Concentration required to produce 50% T 1 suppression; an index of patient sensitivity. The magnitude of interpatient variability in CL was low (16%), as expected based on the importance of Hofmann elimination. The magnitudes of interpatient variability in CL and volume of distribution were low in comparison to those for keo and EC 50 . This suggests that any alterations in the time course of cisatracurium besylate injection-induced neuromuscular blockade were more likely to be due to variability in the PD parameters than in the PK parameters. Parameter estimates from the population PK analyses were supported by noncompartmental PK analyses on data from healthy patients and from specific populations. Conventional PK analyses have shown that the PK of cisatracurium are proportional to dose between 0.1 (2 \u00d7 ED 95 ) and 0.2 (4 \u00d7 ED 95 ) mg/kg cisatracurium. In addition, population PK analyses revealed no statistically significant effect of initial dose on CL for doses between 0.1 (2 \u00d7 ED 95 ) and 0.4 (8 \u00d7 ED 95 ) mg/kg cisatracurium. Distribution The volume of distribution of cisatracurium is limited by its large molecular weight and high polarity. The Vss was equal to 145 mL/kg (Table 6) in healthy 19- to 64-year-old surgical patients receiving opioid anesthesia. The Vss was 21% larger in similar patients receiving inhalation anesthesia. The binding of cisatracurium to plasma proteins has not been successfully studied due to its rapid degradation at physiologic pH. Inhibition of degradation requires nonphysiological conditions of temperature and pH which are associated with changes in protein binding. Elimination Organ-independent Hofmann elimination (a chemical process dependent on pH and temperature) is the predominant pathway for the elimination of cisatracurium. The liver and kidney play a minor role in the elimination of cisatracurium but are primary pathways for the elimination of metabolites. Therefore, the t\u00bd\u03b2 values of metabolites (including laudanosine) are longer in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and metabolite concentrations may be higher after long-term administration [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The mean CL values for cisatracurium ranged from 4.5 to 5.7 mL/min/kg in studies of healthy surgical patients. The compartmental PK modeling suggests that approximately 80% of the cisatracurium CL is accounted for by Hofmann elimination and the remaining 20% by renal and hepatic elimination. These findings are consistent with the low magnitude of interpatient variability in CL (16%) estimated as part of the population PK/PD analyses and with the recovery of parent and metabolites in urine. In studies of healthy surgical patients, mean t \u00bd \u03b2 values of cisatracurium ranged from 22 to 29 minutes and were consistent with the t \u00bd \u03b2 of cisatracurium in vitro (29 minutes). The mean \u00b1 SD t \u00bd \u03b2 values of laudanosine were 3.1 \u00b1 0.4 hours in healthy surgical patients receiving cisatracurium besylate injection (n = 10). Metabolism The degradation of cisatracurium was largely independent of liver metabolism. Results from in vitro experiments suggest that cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination (a pH and temperature-dependent chemical process) to form laudanosine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] and the monoquaternary acrylate metabolite, neither of which has any neuromuscular blocking activity. The monoquaternary acrylate undergoes hydrolysis by non-specific plasma esterases to form the monoquaternary alcohol (MQA) metabolite. The MQA metabolite can also undergo Hofmann elimination but at a much slower rate than cisatracurium. Laudanosine is further metabolized to desmethyl metabolites which are conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in the urine. The laudanosine metabolite of cisatracurium has been noted to cause transient hypotension and, in higher doses, cerebral excitatory effects when administered to several animal species. The relationship between CNS excitation and laudanosine concentrations in humans has not been established [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. During IV infusions of cisatracurium besylate injection, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of laudanosine and the MQA metabolite were approximately 6% and 11% of the parent compound, respectively. The Cmax values of laudanosine in healthy surgical patients receiving infusions of cisatracurium besylate injection were mean \u00b1 SD Cmax: 60 \u00b1 52 ng/mL. Excretion: Following 14C-cisatracurium administration to 6 healthy male patients, 95% of the dose was recovered in the urine (mostly as conjugated metabolites) and 4% in the feces; less than 10% of the dose was excreted as unchanged parent drug in the urine. In 12 healthy surgical patients receiving non-radiolabeled cisatracurium who had Foley catheters placed for surgical management, approximately 15% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. Special Populations Geriatric Patients The results of conventional PK analysis from a study of 12 healthy elderly patients and 12 healthy young adult patients who received a single IV cisatracurium besylate injection dose of 0.1 mg/kg are summarized in Table 7. Plasma clearances of cisatracurium were not affected by age; however, the volumes of distribution were slightly larger in elderly patients than in young patients resulting in slightly longer t\u00bd \u03b2 values for cisatracurium. The rate of equilibration between plasma cisatracurium concentrations and neuromuscular blockade was slower in elderly patients than in young patients (mean \u00b1 SD keo: 0.071 \u00b1 0.036 and 0.105 \u00b1 0.021 minutes-1, respectively); there was no difference in the patient sensitivity to cisatracurium-induced block, as indicated by EC 50 values (mean \u00b1 SD EC 50 : 91 \u00b1 22 and 89 \u00b1 23 ng/mL, respectively). These changes were consistent with the 1-minute slower times to maximum block in elderly patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium besylate injection, when compared to young patients receiving the same dose. The minor differences in PK/PD parameters of cisatracurium between elderly patients and young patients were not associated with clinically significant differences in the recovery profile of cisatracurium besylate injection.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Table 8 summarizes the conventional PK analysis from a study of cisatracurium besylate injection in 13 patients with end-stage liver disease undergoing liver transplantation and 11 healthy adult patients undergoing elective surgery. The slightly larger volumes of distribution in liver transplant patients were associated with slightly higher plasma clearances of cisatracurium. The parallel changes in these parameters resulted in no difference in t \u00bd \u03b2 values. There were no differences in k eo or EC 50 between patient groups. The times to maximum neuromuscular blockade were approximately one minute faster in liver transplant patients than in healthy adult patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium besylate injection. These minor PK differences were not associated with clinically significant differences in the recovery profile of cisatracurium besylate injection. The t \u00bd \u03b2 values of metabolites are longer in patients with hepatic disease and concentrations may be higher after long-term administration. Table 8.

Patients with Renal Impairment: Results from a conventional PK study of cisatracurium besylate injection in 13 healthy adult patients and 15 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who had elective surgery are summarized in Table 9. The PK/PD parameters of cisatracurium were similar in healthy adult patients and ESRD patients. The times to 90% neuromuscular blockade were approximately one minute slower in ESRD patients following 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium besylate injection. There were no differences in the durations or rates of recovery of cisatracurium besylate injection between ESRD and healthy adult patients. The t \u00bd \u03b2 values of metabolites are longer in patients with ESRD and concentrations may be higher after long-term administration. Population PK analyses showed that patients with creatinine clearances \u2264 70 mL/min had a slower rate of equilibration between plasma concentrations and neuromuscular block than patients with normal renal function; this change was associated with a slightly slower (~ 40 seconds) predicted time to 90% T 1 suppression in patients with renal impairment following 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium besylate injection. There was no clinically significant alteration in the recovery profile of cisatracurium besylate injection in patients with renal impairment. The recovery profile of cisatracurium besylate injection is unchanged in the presence of renal or hepatic failure, which is consistent with predominantly organ-independent elimination. Table 9.

Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Patients: The PK of cisatracurium and its metabolites were determined in six ICU patients who received cisatracurium besylate injection and are presented in Table 10. The relationships between plasma cisatracurium concentrations and neuromuscular blockade have not been evaluated in ICU patients. Limited PK data are available for ICU patients with hepatic or renal impairment who received cisatracurium besylate injection. Relative to cisatracurium besylate injection-treated ICU patients with normal renal and hepatic function, metabolite concentrations (plasma and tissues) may be higher in cisatracurium besylate injection-treated ICU patients with renal or hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ].

The CL was higher in healthy pediatric patients (5.89 mL/min/kg) than in healthy adult patients (4.57 mL/min/kg) during opioid anesthesia. The rate of equilibration between plasma concentrations and neuromuscular blockade, as indicated by k eo , was faster in healthy pediatric patients receiving halothane anesthesia (0.1330 minutes -1 ) than in healthy adult patients receiving opioid anesthesia (0.0575 minutes -1 ). The EC 50 in healthy pediatric patients (125 ng/mL) was similar to the value in healthy adult patients (141 ng/mL) during opioid anesthesia. The minor differences in the PK/PD parameters of cisatracurium were associated with a faster time to onset and a shorter duration of cisatracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade in pediatric patients. Sex and Obesity: Although population PK/PD analyses revealed that sex and obesity were associated with effects on the PK and/or PD of cisatracurium; these PK/PD changes were not associated with clinically significant alterations in the predicted onset or recovery profile of cisatracurium besylate injection. Use of Inhalation Agents: The use of inhalation agents was associated with a 21% larger Vss, a 78% larger keo, and a 15% lower EC50 for cisatracurium. These changes resulted in a slightly faster (~ 45 seconds) predicted time to 90% T 1 suppression in patients who received 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium during inhalation anesthesia than in patients who received the same dose of cisatracurium during opioid anesthesia; however, there were no clinically significant differences in the predicted recovery profile of cisatracurium besylate injection between patient groups.

Metabolites are inactive at both the \u03b1-1 and \u03b1-2 adrenergic receptors. Following parenteral administration of phenylephrine hydrochloride, increases in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, and total peripheral vascular resistance are observed. The onset of blood pressure increase following an intravenous bolus phenylephrine hydrochloride administration is rapid and the effect may persist for up to 20 minutes. As mean arterial pressure increases following parenteral doses, vagal activity also increases, resulting in reflex bradycardia. Most vascular beds are constricted, including renal, splanchnic, and hepatic. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following an intravenous infusion of phenylephrine hydrochloride, the effective half-life was approximately 5 minutes. The steady-state volume of distribution (340 L) exceeded the body volume by a factor of 5, suggesting a high distribution into certain organ compartments. The average total serum clearance (2095 mL/min) was close to one-third of the cardiac output. A mass balance study showed that phenylephrine is extensively metabolized by the liver with only 12% of the dose excreted unchanged in the urine.

Criteria for issuing an EUA include: The biological agent(s) can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. Based on the totality of the available scientific evidence (including data from adequate and well controlled clinical trials, if available), it is reasonable to believe that: the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and the known and potential benefits of the product - when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat such disease or condition - outweigh the known and potential risks of the product, taking into consideration the material threat posed by the biological agent(s). There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the serious or life-threatening disease or condition. Information Regarding Available Alternatives for the EUA Authorized Use There are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives to PEMGARDA for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in individuals who are unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination.

Following single-dose administration of pemivibart 4500 mg IV, calculated geometric mean titer values (pemivibart concentration divided by the authentic virus neutralization assay EC 50 value against JN.1) [see Microbiology (12.4 )] range from 3451 (on Day 90) to 22552 (end of infusion on Day 1). After the repeat dose of pemivibart 4500 mg IV every 3 months, it is anticipated that the range of titers at steady-state will be approximately 33% higher than those observed following the first dose administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A summary of PK parameters of pemivibart following administration of a single 4500 IV dose of pemivibart to adults based on population PK modeling is provided in Table 1.

Note: All values presented as geometric mean (% covariance), except for T 1/2 , which is presented as median (min, max). Numerical values are post-hoc PK parameter estimates for subjects enrolled in Phase 3 CANOPY. Specific Populations : The PK of pemivibart was not substantially affected by age, sex, or race based on a population PK analysis to the pooled data from VYD222-1-001 and Phase 3 CANOPY. Body weight is not expected to have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of pemivibart in individuals with body weights ranging from 43 to 190 kg through 3 months postdose. Patients with Immune Compromise Population PK analysis showed immune compromise status had no clinically relevant effect on the PK of pemivibart. Pediatric Patients The PK of pemivibart in pediatric individuals has not been evaluated. The dosing regimen is expected to result in comparable plasma exposures of pemivibart in pediatric individuals 12 years of age or older who weigh at least 40 kg as observed in adult individuals [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment Renal impairment is not expected to impact the PK of pemivibart since mAbs with molecular weight >69 kDa are known not to undergo renal elimination. Similarly, dialysis is not expected to impact the PK of pemivibart. Patients with hepatic impairment Pemivibart is not anticipated to be impacted by hepatic impairment. Pemivibart is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as other IgG mAbs and human endogenous IgG antibodies. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action: Pemivibart is a recombinant human monoclonal IgG1\u03bb antibody that targets the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), thereby inhibiting virus attachment to the human ACE2 receptor on host cells. Amino acid substitutions in the Fc region (M435L/N441A) of pemivibart extend serum half-life. Pemivibart binds the spike RBD proteins of ancestral SARS\u2011CoV-2 B.1 (D614G) and Omicron variants BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5 with equilibrium dissociation constants (K D ) of 2.1 nM, 18 nM, 13.5 nM, and 15.9 nM, respectively, and blocks attachment of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and BA.2.86 variant RBD proteins to the human ACE2 receptor with IC 50 values of 0.068 nM (10 ng/mL) and 23 nM (3370 ng/mL), respectively. Antiviral Activity: Pemivibart neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Vero E6 or Vero E6-TMPRSS2 cells with EC 50 values of 0.165-0.230 nM (24.3-34 ng/mL) against B.1, and 0.075 nM (11 ng/mL) against B.1.617.2 (Delta). For Omicron variants, EC 50 values were 0.096 nM (14.2 ng/mL) against BA.1, 0.039 nM (5.8 ng/mL) against BA.2, 0.175 nM (25.8 ng/mL) against BA.4.1, 0.80-4.48 nM (118-661.2 ng/mL) against XBB.1.16, 1.97-3.25 nM (290-479.9 ng/mL) against XBB.1.5, 9.8 nM (1,445 ng/mL) against EG.5.1, 3.59 nM (529.4 ng/mL) against HV.1, and 0.43 nM (63.6 ng/mL) against JN.1. Pemivibart has not been directly evaluated for Fc-mediated effector functions or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. The parent antibody of pemivibart, which contains an identical Fc region and targets an overlapping epitope, exhibited antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD), but failed to exhibit detectable ADE in cell culture. Antiviral Resistance: There is a potential risk of prophylaxis failure due to the emergence of a pemivibart-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variant. Prescribing healthcare providers should consider the prevalence of SARS\u2011CoV-2 variants in their area, where data are available, when considering prophylactic treatment options. Data are limited regarding the scope of spike substitutions in Omicron-lineage variants that may confer significantly reduced susceptibility to pemivibart. Escape variants were identified following serial passage of SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron XBB.1.5.6) in cell culture in the presence of pemivibart that contained a T500N spike substitution or a combination of Q489R, N501Y, and Y505H spike substitutions. Each of these substitutions is within 5 \u00c5 of the pemivibart binding interface. Pemivibart neutralization susceptibility of recent and historic SARS-CoV-2 variants was evaluated using a pseudotyped, luciferase-expressing, lentivirus virus-like particle (VLP) assay. Pemivibart neutralized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-pseudotyped VLPs representing B.1 and pre-Omicron variants with EC 50 values ranging from 0.022 to 0.083 nM (3.2 to 12.2 ng/mL), and Omicron-lineage variants with EC 50 values ranging from 0.198 to 14.3 nM (29.2 to 2,112 ng/mL) (Table 2).

The MINI-BAG Plus Container is a standard diluent container with an integral drug vial adaptor. It allows for drug admixture after connection to a single dose powdered or liquid (up to 10 mL) drug vial having a 20 mm closure. A breakaway seal in the tube between the vial adaptor and the container is broken to allow transfer of the diluent into the vial and reconstitution of the drug. The Mini-Bag Plus product mechanically prohibits the transfer of contaminants into and out of the system during and after docking, minimizing environmental and personal exposure. The reconstituted drug is then transferred from the vial into the container diluent and mixed to result in an admixture for delivery to the patient. The VIAFLEX Plus plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride (PL 146 Plastic). VIAFLEX Plus on the container indicates the presence of a drug additive in a drug vehicle. The VIAFLEX Plus plastic container system utilizes the same container as the VIAFLEX plastic container system. The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period, e.g., di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), up to 5 parts per million.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fentanyl Citrate Injection is an opioid agonist, whose principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Fentanyl produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Fentanyl causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemmorhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Fentanyl causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Fentanyl produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritis, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and lutenizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration \u2013 Efficacy Relationships A dose of 100 mcg (0.1 mg) (2.0 mL) of Fentanyl Citrate Injection is approximately equivalent in analgesic activity to 10 mg of morphine or 75 mg of meperidine. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of fentanyl for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . The onset of action of fentanyl is almost immediate when the drug is given intravenously; however, the maximal analgesic effect may not be noted for several minutes. The usual duration of action of the analgesic effect is 30 to 60 minutes after a single intravenous dose of up to 100 mcg (0.1 mg) (2 mL). Following intramuscular administration, the onset of action is from seven to eight minutes, and the duration of action is one to two hours. Concentration \u2013 Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing fentanyl plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . The onset of action of fentanyl is almost immediate when the drug is given intravenously; however, the maximal respiratory depressant effect may not be noted for several minutes. As with longer acting narcotic analgesics, the duration of the respiratory depressant effect of fentanyl may be longer than the analgesic effect. The following observations have been reported concerning altered respiratory response to CO 2 stimulation following administration of fentanyl citrate: Diminished sensitivity to CO 2 stimulation may persist longer than depression of respiratory rate. (Altered sensitivity to CO 2 stimulation has been demonstrated for up to four hours following a single-dose of 600 mcg [0.6 mg] [12 mL] fentanyl to healthy volunteers.) Fentanyl frequently slows the respiratory rate, duration and degree of respiratory depression being dose related The peak respiratory depressant effect of a single intravenous dose of fentanyl citrate is noted 5 to 15 minutes following injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Fentanyl Citrate Injection is administered by the intravenous or intramuscular route. The pharmacokinetics of fentanyl can be described as a three-compartment model. Distribution Fentanyl plasma protein binding capacity increases with increasing ionization of the drug. Alterations in pH may affect its distribution between plasma and the central nervous system. It accumulates in skeletal muscle and fat and is released slowly into the blood. The volume of distribution for fentanyl is 4 L/kg. It has a distribution time of 1.7 minutes and redistribution time of 13 minutes. Elimination The terminal elimination half-life is 219 minutes. Fentanyl, which is primarily transformed in the liver, demonstrates a high first pass clearance and releases approximately 75% of an intravenous dose in urine, mostly as metabolites with less than 10% representing the unchanged drug. Approximately 9% of the dose is recovered in the feces, primarily as metabolites."], "manufacturer_name": ["Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC"], "substance_name": ["FENTANYL CITRATE"], "effective_time": "20240105", "product_ndc": ["63323-808", "63323-810"], "brand_name": ["Fentanyl Citrate"]}

This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or \u201cbundles\u201d of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis. Following intravenous administration of paclitaxel, paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner. The initial rapid decline represents distribution to the peripheral compartment and elimination of the drug. The later phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of paclitaxel from the peripheral compartment. Pharmacokinetic parameters of paclitaxel following 3- and 24-hour infusions of paclitaxel at dose levels of 135 and 175 mg/m 2 were determined in a Phase 3 randomized study in ovarian cancer patients and are summarized in the following table: TABLE 1. SUMMARY OF PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS\u2014MEAN VALUES Dose (mg/m 2 ) Infusion Duration (h) N (patients) C max (ng/mL) AUC (0-\u221e) (ng\u2022h/mL) T-HALF (h) CL T (L/h/m 2 ) 135 24 2 195 6,300 52.7 21.7 175 24 4 365 7,993 15.7 23.8 135 3 7 2,170 7,952 13.1 17.7 175 3 5 3,650 15,007 20.2 12.2 C max = Maximum plasma concentration AUC (0 \u221e) = Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity CL T = Total body clearance It appeared that with the 24-hour infusion of paclitaxel, a 30% increase in dose (135 mg/m 2 vs 175 mg/m 2 ) increased the Cmax by 87%, whereas the AUC (0-\u221e) remained proportional. However, with a 3- hour infusion, for a 30% increase in dose, the Cmax and AUC (0-\u221e) were increased by 68% and 89%, respectively. The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state, with the 24-hour infusion of paclitaxel, ranged from 227 to 688 L/m 2 , indicating extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding of paclitaxel. The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel were also evaluated in adult cancer patients who received single doses of 15 to 135 mg/m 2 given by 1-hour infusions (n=15), 30 to 275 mg/m 2 given by 6-hour infusions (n=36), and 200 to 275 mg/m 2 given by 24-hour infusions (n=54) in Phase 1 and 2 studies. Values for CLT and volume of distribution were consistent with the findings in the Phase 3 study. The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma have not been studied. In vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins, using paclitaxel concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 mcg/mL, indicate that between 89 to 98% of drug is bound; the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel. After intravenous administration of 15 to 275 mg/m 2 doses of paclitaxel as 1-, 6-, or 24-hour infusions, mean values for cumulative urinary recovery of unchanged drug ranged from 1.3% to 12.6% of the dose, indicating extensive non-renal clearance. In 5 patients administered a 225 or 250 mg/m 2 dose of radiolabeled paclitaxel as a 3-hour infusion, a mean of 71% of the radioactivity was excreted in the feces in 120 hours, and 14% was recovered in the urine. Total recovery of radioactivity ranged from 56% to 101% of the dose. Paclitaxel represented a mean of 5% of the administered radioactivity recovered in the feces, while metabolites, primarily 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel, accounted for the balance. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices showed that paclitaxel was metabolized primarily to 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel by the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2C8; and to 2 minor metabolites, 3'- p -hydroxypaclitaxel and 6\u03b1, 3'- p -dihydroxypaclitaxel, by CYP3A4. In vitro , the metabolism of paclitaxel to 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel was inhibited by a number of agents (ketoconazole, verapamil, diazepam, quinidine, dexamethasone, cyclosporin, teniposide, etoposide, and vincristine), but the concentrations used exceeded those found in vivo following normal therapeutic doses. Testosterone, 17\u03b1-ethinyl estradiol, retinoic acid, and quercetin, a specific inhibitor of CYP2C8, also inhibited the formation of 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel in vitro . The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel may also be altered in vivo as a result of interactions with compounds that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A4 (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). The disposition and toxicity of paclitaxel 3-hour infusion were evaluated in 35 patients with varying degrees of hepatic function. Relative to patients with normal bilirubin, plasma paclitaxel exposure in patients with abnormal serum bilirubin \u22642 times upper limit of normal (ULN) administered 175 mg/m 2 was increased, but with no apparent increase in the frequency or severity of toxicity. In 5 patients with serum total bilirubin >2 times ULN, there was a statistically nonsignificant higher incidence of severe myelosuppression, even at a reduced dose (110 mg/m 2 ), but no observed increase in plasma exposure (see PRECAUTIONS, Hepatic and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

The mechanism of action of ketorolac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. The biological activity of ketorolac tromethamine is associated with the S-form. Ketorolac tromethamine possesses no sedative or anxiolytic properties. The peak analgesic effect of ketorolac tromethamine occurs within 2 to 3 hours and is not statistically significantly different over the recommended dosage range of ketorolac tromethamine. The greatest difference between large and small doses of ketorolac tromethamine by either route is in the duration of analgesia. Pharmacokinetics Ketorolac tromethamine is a racemic mixture of [-]S- and [+]R-enantiomeric forms, with the S\u2011form having analgesic activity. Comparison of Intravenous, Intramuscular and Oral Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of ketorolac tromethamine, following intravenous, intramuscular, and oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine are compared in Table 1.

This implies that the pharmacokinetics of ketorolac tromethamine in adults, following single or multiple intramuscular, intravenous, or recommended oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine, are linear. At the higher recommended doses, there is a proportional increase in the concentrations of free and bound racemate. Distribution The mean apparent volume (V\u03b2) of ketorolac tromethamine following complete distribution was approximately 13 liters. This parameter was determined from single-dose data. The ketorolac tromethamine racemate has been shown to be highly protein bound (99%). Nevertheless, plasma concentrations as high as 10 mcg/mL will only occupy approximately 5% of the albumin binding sites. Thus, the unbound fraction for each enantiomer will be constant over the therapeutic range. A decrease in serum albumin, however, will result in increased free drug concentrations. Ketorolac tromethamine is excreted in human milk (see PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Nursing Mothers ). Metabolism Ketorolac tromethamine is largely metabolized in the liver. The metabolic products are hydroxylated and conjugated forms of the parent drug. The products of metabolism, and some unchanged drug, are excreted in the urine. Excretion The principal route of elimination of ketorolac and its metabolites is renal. About 92% of a given dose is found in the urine, approximately 40% as metabolites and 60% as unchanged ketorolac. Approximately 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces. A single-dose study with 10 mg ketorolac tromethamine (n = 9) demonstrated that the S-enantiomer is cleared approximately two times faster than the R-enantiomer and that the clearance was independent of the route of administration. This means that the ratio of S/R plasma concentrations decreases with time after each dose. There is little or no inversion of the R- to S- form in humans. The clearance of the racemate in normal subjects, elderly individuals and in hepatically and renally impaired patients is outlined in Table 2 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \u2013 Kinetics in Special Populations ) . The half-life of the ketorolac tromethamine S-enantiomer was approximately 2.5 hours (SD \u00b1 0.4) compared with 5 hours (SD \u00b1 1.7) for the R-enantiomer. In other studies, the half-life for the racemate has been reported to lie within the range of 5 to 6 hours. Accumulation Ketorolac tromethamine administered as an intravenous bolus, every 6 hours, for 5 days, to healthy subjects (n = 13), showed no significant difference in Cmax on Day 1 and Day 5. Trough levels averaged 0.29 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 0.13) on Day 1 and 0.55 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 0.23) on Day 6. Steady state was approached after the fourth dose. Accumulation of ketorolac tromethamine has not been studied in special populations (geriatric, pediatric, renal failure patients, or hepatic disease patients). Kinetics in Special Populations Geriatric Patients Based on single-dose data only, the half-life of the ketorolac tromethamine racemate increased from 5 to 7 hours in the elderly (65 to 78 years) compared with young healthy volunteers (24 to 35 years) (see Table 2 ). There was little difference in the Cmax for the two groups (elderly, 2.52 mcg/mL \u00b1 0.77; young, 2.99 mcg/mL \u00b1 1.03) (see PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Geriatric Use ). Pediatric Patients Limited information is available regarding the pharmacokinetics of dosing of ketorolac tromethamine in the pediatric population. Following a single intravenous bolus dose of 0.5 mg/kg in 10 children 4 to 8 years old, the half-life was 5.8 \u00b1 1.6 hours, the average clearance was 0.042 \u00b1 0.01 L/hr/kg, the volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V\u03b2) was 0.34 \u00b1 0.12 L/kg and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 0.26 \u00b1 0.08 L/kg. The volume of distribution and clearance of ketorolac in pediatric patients was higher than those observed in adult subjects (see Table 1 ). There are no pharmacokinetic data available for administration of ketorolac tromethamine by the intramuscular route in pediatric patients. Renal Insufficiency Based on single-dose data only, the mean half-life of ketorolac tromethamine in renally impaired patients is between 6 and 19 hours and is dependent on the extent of the impairment. There is poor correlation between creatinine clearance and total ketorolac tromethamine clearance in the elderly and populations with renal impairment (r = 0.5). In patients with renal disease, the AUC\u221e of each enantiomer increased by approximately 100% compared with healthy volunteers. The volume of distribution doubles for the S-enantiomer and increases by 1/5th for the R-enantiomer. The increase in volume of distribution of ketorolac tromethamine implies an increase in unbound fraction. The AUC\u221e-ratio of the ketorolac tromethamine enantiomers in healthy subjects and patients remained similar, indicating there was no selective excretion of either enantiomer in patients compared to healthy subjects (see WARNINGS \u2013 Renal Effects ). Hepatic Insufficiency There was no significant difference in estimates of half-life, AUC\u221e and Cmax, in 7 patients with liver disease compared to healthy volunteers (see PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Hepatic Effects and Table 2 ). Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified.

{"indications_and_usage": ["Indication and Usage CORTROSYN\u2122 (cosyntropin) for Injection is intended for use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency. Because of its rapid effect on the adrenal cortex it may be utilized to perform a 30-minute test of adrenal function (plasma cortisol response) as an office or outpatient procedure, using only 2 venipunctures (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). Severe hypofunction of the pituitary - adrenal axis is usually associated with subnormal plasma cortisol values but a low basal level is not per se evidence of adrenal insufficiency and does not suffice to make the diagnosis. Many patients with proven insufficiency will have normal basal levels and will develop signs of insufficiency only when stressed. For this reason a criterion which should be used in establishing the diagnosis is the failure to respond to adequate corticotropin stimulation. When presumptive adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed by a subnormal CORTROSYN\u2122 test, further studies are indicated to determine if it is primary or secondary. Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) is the result of an intrinsic disease process, such as tuberculosis within the gland. The production of adrenocortical hormones is deficient despite high ACTH levels (feedback mechanism). Secondary or relative insufficiency arises as the result of defective production of ACTH leading in turn to disuse atrophy of the adrenal cortex. It is commonly seen, for example, as result of corticosteroid therapy, Sheehan's syndrome and pituitary tumors or ablation. The differentiation of both types is based on the premise that a primarily defective gland cannot be stimulated by ACTH whereas a secondarily defective gland is potentially functional and will respond to adequate stimulation with ACTH. Patients selected for further study as the result of a subnormal CORTROSYN\u2122 test should be given a 3 or 4 day course of treatment with Repository Corticotropin Injection USP and then retested. Suggested doses are 40 USP units twice daily for 4 days or 60 USP units twice daily for 3 days.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K d = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K d = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to seven or eight hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 \u2013 2.8, 2.8 \u2013 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] .

Human N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.4) is a hydrolytic lysosomal glycosaminoglycan-specific enzyme that hydrolyzes sulfate from either galactose-6-sulfate or N-acetyl-galactosamine-6-sulfate on the non-reducing ends of the glycosaminoglycans keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin-6-sulfate (C6S). Elosulfase alfa is a soluble glycosylated dimeric protein with two oligosaccharide chains per monomer. Each monomeric peptide chain contains 496 amino acids and has an approximate molecular mass of 55 kDa (59 kDa including the oligosaccharides). One of the oligosaccharide chains contains bis-mannose-6-phosphate (bisM6P). bisM6P binds a receptor at the cell surface and the binding mediates cellular uptake of the protein to the lysosome. Elosulfase alfa has a specific activity of 2.6 to 6.0 units/mg. One activity unit is defined as the amount of the enzyme required to convert 1 micromole of sulfated monosaccharide substrate D-galactopyranoside-6-sulfate (Gal-6S) to de-sulfated-galactose (Gal) and free sulfate per minute at 37\u00b0C.

Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA, Morquio A Syndrome) is characterized by the absence or marked reduction in N -acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase activity. The sulfatase activity deficiency results in the accumulation of the GAG substrates, KS and C6S, in the lysosomal compartment of cells throughout the body. The accumulation leads to widespread cellular, tissue, and organ dysfunction. Vimizim is intended to provide the exogenous enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase that will be taken up into the lysosomes and increase the catabolism of the GAGs KS and C6S. Elosulfase alfa uptake by cells into lysosomes is mediated by the binding of mannose-6-phosphate-terminated oligosaccharide chains of elosulfase alfa to mannose-6-phosphate receptors. In the absence of an animal disease model that recapitulates the human disease phenotype, elosulfase alfa pharmacological activity was evaluated using human primary chondrocytes from two MPS IVA patients. Treatment of MPS IVA chondrocytes with elosulfase alfa induced clearance of KS lysosomal storage from the chondrocytes. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamic effect of Vimizim was assessed by reductions in urinary KS levels. The relationship of urinary KS to other measures of clinical response has not been established [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. No association was observed between antibody development and urinary KS levels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of elosulfase alfa were evaluated in 23 patients with MPS IVA who received intravenous infusions of Vimizim 2 mg/kg once weekly, over approximately 4 hours, for 22 weeks.

{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE: To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Gentamicin Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Gentamicin Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Gentamicin Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species (indole-positive and indole-negative), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia species, Citrobacter species and Staphylococcus species (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative). Clinical studies have shown gentamicin injection to be effective in bacterial neonatal sepsis; bacterial septicemia and serious bacterial infections of the central nervous system (meningitis), urinary tract, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract (including peritonitis), skin, bone and soft tissue (including burns). Aminoglycosides, including gentamicin, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are susceptible to these antibiotics and are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential for toxicity. Specimens for bacterial culture should be obtained to isolate and identify causative organisms and to determine their susceptibility to gentamicin. Gentamicin injection may be considered as initial therapy in suspected or confirmed gram-negative infections, and therapy may be instituted before obtaining results of susceptibility testing. The decision to continue therapy with this drug should be based on the results of susceptibility tests, the severity of the infection and the important additional concepts contained in the BOXED WARNINGS . If the causative organisms are resistant to gentamicin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In serious infections when the causative organisms are unknown, gentamicin injection may be administered as initial therapy in conjunction with a penicillin-type or cephalosporin-type drug before obtaining results of susceptibility testing. If anaerobic organisms are suspected as etiologic agents, consideration should be given to using other suitable antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with gentamicin. Following identification of the organism and its susceptibility, appropriate antibiotic therapy should then be continued. Gentamicin injection has been used effectively in combination with carbenicillin for the treatment of life-threatening infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It has also been found effective when used in conjunction with a penicillin-type drug for treatment of endocarditis caused by group D streptococci. Gentamicin injection has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of serious staphylococcal infections. While not the antibiotic of first choice, gentamicin injection may be considered when penicillins or other less potentially toxic drugs are contraindicated and bacterial susceptibility tests and clinical judgment indicate its use. It may also be considered in mixed infections caused by susceptible strains of staphylococci and gram-negative organisms. In the neonate with suspected bacterial sepsis or staphylococcal pneumonia, a penicillin-type drug is also usually indicated as concomitant therapy with gentamicin."], "generic_name": ["GENTAMICIN SULFATE"], "id": "48a57ed5-3809-49cc-a7ec-715e7e2c1720", "route": ["INTRAMUSCULAR", "INTRAVENOUS"], "description": ["DESCRIPTION: Gentamicin sulfate, a water-soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, is derived by the growth of Micromonospora purpurea , an actinomycete.

Sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid may have been added for pH adjustment. Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: After intramuscular (IM) administration of gentamicin sulfate, peak serum concentrations usually occur between 30 and 60 minutes and serum levels are measurable for six to eight hours. When gentamicin is administered by intravenous (IV) infusion over a two-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by IM administration. In patients with normal renal function, peak serum concentrations of gentamicin (mcg/mL) are usually up to four times the single IM dose (mg/kg); for example, a 1 mg/kg injection in adults may be expected to result in a peak serum concentration up to 4 mcg/mL; a 1.5 mg/kg dose may produce levels up to 6 mcg/mL. While some variation is to be expected due to a number of variables such as age, body temperature, surface area and physiologic differences, the individual patient given the same dose tends to have similar levels in repeated determinations. Gentamicin administered at 1 mg/kg every eight hours for the usual 7 to 10 day treatment period to patients with normal renal function does not accumulate in the serum. Gentamicin, like all aminoglycosides, may accumulate in the serum and tissues of patients treated with higher doses and/or for prolonged periods, particularly in the presence of impaired renal function. In adult patients, treatment with gentamicin dosages of 4 mg/kg/day or higher for 7 to 10 days may result in a slight, progressive rise in both peak and trough concentrations. In patients with impaired renal function, gentamicin is cleared from the body more slowly than in patients with normal renal function. The more severe the impairment, the slower the clearance. (Dosage must be adjusted.) Since gentamicin is distributed in extra-cellular fluid, peak serum concentrations may be lower than usual in adult patients who have a large volume of this fluid. Serum concentrations of gentamicin in febrile patients may be lower than those in afebrile patients given the same dose. When body temperature returns to normal, serum concentrations of the drug may rise. Febrile and anemic states may be associated with a shorter than usual serum half-life. (Dosage adjustment is usually not necessary.) In severely burned patients, the half-life may be significantly decreased and resulting serum concentrations may be lower than anticipated from the mg/kg dose. Protein binding studies have indicated that the degree of gentamicin binding is low; depending upon the methods used for testing, this may be between 0 and 30%. After initial administration to patients with normal renal function, generally 70% or more of the gentamicin dose is recoverable in the urine in 24 hours; concentrations in urine above 100 mcg/mL may be achieved. Little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs; the drug is excreted principally by glomerular filtration. After several days of treatment, the amount of gentamicin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. As with other aminoglycosides, a small amount of the gentamicin dose may be retained in the tissues, especially in the kidneys. Minute quantities of aminoglycosides have been detected in the urine weeks after drug administration was discontinued. Renal clearance of gentamicin is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. In patients with marked impairment of renal function, there is a decrease in the concentration of aminoglycosides in urine and in their penetration into defective renal parenchyma. This decreased drug excretion, together with the potential nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides, should be considered when treating such patients who have urinary tract infections. Probenecid does not affect renal tubular transport of gentamicin. The endogenous creatinine clearance rate and the serum creatinine level have a high correlation with the half-life of gentamicin in serum. Results of these tests may serve as guides for adjusting dosage in patients with renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Following parenteral administration, gentamicin can be detected in serum, lymph, tissues, sputum and in pleural, synovial and peritoneal fluids. Concentrations in renal cortex sometimes may be eight times higher than the usual serum levels. Concentrations in bile, in general, have been low and have suggested minimal biliary excretion. Gentamicin crosses the peritoneal as well as the placental membranes. Since aminoglycosides diffuse poorly into the subarachnoid space after parenteral administration, concentrations of gentamicin in cerebrospinal fluid are often low and dependent upon dose, rate of penetration and degree of meningeal inflammation. There is minimal penetration of gentamicin into ocular tissues following IM or IV administration. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside, binds to the prokaryotic ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis in susceptible bacteria. It is bactericidal in vitro against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of Resistance Bacterial resistance to gentamicin is generally developed slowly. Bacteria resistant to one aminoglycoside may be resistant to one or more other aminoglycosides. The following bacteria are usually resistant to the aminoglycosides, including gentamicin: most streptococcal species (including Streptococcus pneumoniae and the Group D streptococci), most enterococcal species (including Enterococcus faecalis , E. faecium , and E. durans ), and anaerobic organisms, such as Bacteroides species and Clostridium species. Aminoglycosides are known to be not effective against Salmonella and Shigella species in patients. Therefore, in vitro susceptibility test results should not be reported. Interactions with Other Antimicrobials In vitro studies show that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell wall synthesis may act synergistically against some enterococcal strains. The combination of gentamicin and penicillin G has a synergistic bactericidal effect against strains of Enterococcus faecalis , E. faecium and E. durans . An enhanced killing effect against many of these strains has also been shown in vitro with combinations of gentamicin and ampicillin, carbenicillin, nafcillin or oxacillin. The combined effect of gentamicin and carbenicillin is synergistic for many strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vitro synergism against other Gram- negative organisms has been shown with combinations of gentamicin and cephalosporins. Gentamicin may be active against clinical isolates of bacteria resistant to other aminoglycosides. Antibacterial Activity Gentamicin has been shown to be active against most of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ).

Arg chem structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that reversibly binds to the thrombin active site. Argatroban does not require the co-factor antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Argatroban exerts its anticoagulant effects by inhibiting thrombin-catalyzed or -induced reactions, including fibrin formation; activation of coagulation factors V, VIII, and XIII; activation of protein C; and platelet aggregation. Argatroban inhibits thrombin with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.04 \u03bcM. At therapeutic concentrations, argatroban has little or no effect on related serine proteases (trypsin, factor Xa, plasmin, and kallikrein). Argatroban is capable of inhibiting the action of both free and clot-associated thrombin. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics When argatroban is administered by continuous infusion, anticoagulant effects and plasma concentrations of argatroban follow similar, predictable temporal response profiles, with low intersubject variability. Immediately upon initiation of argatroban infusion, anticoagulant effects are produced as plasma argatroban concentrations begin to rise. Steady-state levels of both drug and anticoagulant effect are typically attained within 1 to 3 hours and are maintained until the infusion is discontinued or the dosage adjusted. Steady-state plasma argatroban concentrations increase proportionally with dose (for infusion doses up to 40 mcg/kg/min in healthy subjects) and are well correlated with steady-state anticoagulant effects. For infusion doses up to 40 mcg/kg/min, argatroban increases in a dose-dependent fashion, the aPTT, ACT, the prothrombin time (PT), the International Normalized Ratio (INR), and the thrombin time (TT) in healthy volunteers and cardiac patients. Representative steady-state plasma argatroban concentrations and anticoagulant effects are shown below for argatroban infusion doses up to 10 mcg/kg/min (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Relationship at Steady State Between Argatroban Dose, Plasma Argatroban Concentration and Anticoagulant Effect Effect on International Normalized Ratio (INR): Because argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor, co-administration of argatroban and warfarin produces a combined effect on the laboratory measurement of the INR. However, concurrent therapy, compared to warfarin monotherapy, exerts no additional effect on vitamin K\u2013dependent factor Xa activity. The relationship between INR on co-therapy and warfarin alone is dependent on both the dose of argatroban and the thromboplastin reagent used. This relationship is influenced by the International Sensitivity Index (ISI) of the thromboplastin. Data for 2 commonly utilized thromboplastins with ISI values of 0.88 (Innovin, Dade) and 1.78 (Thromboplastin C Plus, Dade) are presented in Figure 2 for an argatroban dose of 2 mcg/kg/min. Thromboplastins with higher ISI values than shown result in higher INRs on combined therapy of warfarin and argatroban. These data are based on results obtained in normal individuals [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Figure 2. INR Relationship of Argatroban Plus Warfarin Versus Warfarin Alone Figure 2 demonstrates the relationship between INR for warfarin alone and INR for warfarin co-administered with argatroban at a dose of 2 mcg/kg/min. To calculate INR for warfarin alone (INR W ), based on INR for co-therapy of warfarin and argatroban (INR WA ), when the argatroban dose is 2 mcg/kg/min, use the equation next to the appropriate curve. Example: At a dose of 2 mcg/kg/min and an INR performed with Thromboplastin A, the equation 0.19 + 0.57 (INR WA ) = INR W would allow a prediction of the INR on warfarin alone (INR W ). Thus, using an INR WA value of 4.0 obtained on combined therapy: INR W = 0.19 + 0.57 (4) = 2.47 as the value for INR on warfarin alone. The error (confidence interval) associated with a prediction is \u00b1 0.4 units. Similar linear relationships and prediction errors exist for argatroban at a dose of 1 mcg/kg/min. Thus, for argatroban doses of 1 or 2 mcg/kg/min, INR W can be predicted from INR WA . For argatroban doses greater than 2 mcg/kg/min, the error associated with predicting INR W from INR WA is \u00b1 1. Thus, INR W cannot be reliably predicted from INR WA at doses greater than 2 mcg/kg/min. Figure 1 Figure 2 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Argatroban distributes mainly in the extracellular fluid as evidenced by an apparent steady-state volume of distribution of 174 mL/kg (12.18 L in a 70 kg adult). Argatroban is 54% bound to human serum proteins, with binding to albumin and \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein being 20% and 34%, respectively. Metabolism The main route of argatroban metabolism is hydroxylation and aromatization of the 3-methyltetrahydroquinoline ring in the liver. The formation of each of the 4 known metabolites is catalyzed in vitro by the human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4/5. The primary metabolite (M1) exerts 3- to 5-fold weaker anticoagulant effects than argatroban. Unchanged argatroban is the major component in plasma. The plasma concentrations of M1 range between 0% and 20% of that of the parent drug. The other metabolites (M2 to M4) are found only in very low quantities in the urine and have not been detected in plasma or feces. These data, together with the lack of effect of erythromycin (a potent CYP3A4/5 inhibitor) on argatroban pharmacokinetics, suggest that CYP3A4/5-mediated metabolism is not an important elimination pathway in vivo . Total body clearance is approximately 5.1 mL/kg/min (0.31 L/kg/hr) for infusion doses up to 40 mcg/kg/min. The terminal elimination half-life of argatroban ranges between 39 and 51 minutes. There is no interconversion of the 21\u2013(R):21\u2013(S) diastereoisomers. The plasma ratio of these diastereoisomers is unchanged by metabolism or hepatic impairment, remaining constant at 65:35 (\u00b1 2%). Excretion Argatroban is excreted primarily in the feces, presumably through biliary secretion. In a study in which 14 C-argatroban (5 mcg/kg/min) was infused for 4 hours into healthy subjects, approximately 65% of the radioactivity was recovered in the feces within 6 days of the start of infusion with little or no radioactivity subsequently detected. Approximately 22% of the radioactivity appeared in the urine within 12 hours of the start of infusion. Little or no additional urinary radioactivity was subsequently detected. Average percent recovery of unchanged drug, relative to total dose, was 16% in urine and at least 14% in feces. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment: The dosage of argatroban should be decreased in patients with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Patients with hepatic impairment were not studied in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) trials. At a dose of 2.5 mcg/kg/min, hepatic impairment is associated with decreased clearance and increased elimination half-life of argatroban (to 1.9 mL/kg/min and 181 minutes, respectively, for patients with a Child-Pugh score greater than 6). Renal Impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal dysfunction. The effect of renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of argatroban was studied in 6 subjects with normal renal function (mean Clcr = 95 \u00b1 16 mL/min) and in 18 subjects with mild (mean Clcr = 64 \u00b1 10 mL/min), moderate (mean Clcr = 41 \u00b1 5.8 mL/min), and severe (mean Clcr = 5 \u00b1 7 mL/min) renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of argatroban at dosages up to 5 mcg/kg/min were not significantly affected by renal dysfunction. Use of argatroban was evaluated in a study of 12 patients with stable end-stage renal disease undergoing chronic intermittent hemodialysis. Argatroban was administered at a rate of 2 to 3 mcg/kg/min (begun at least 4 hours prior to dialysis) or as a bolus dose of 250 mcg/kg at the start of dialysis followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mcg/kg/min. Although these regimens did not achieve the goal of maintaining ACT values at 1.8 times the baseline value throughout most of the hemodialysis period, the hemodialysis sessions were successfully completed with both of these regimens. The mean ACTs produced in this study ranged from 1.39 to 1.82 times baseline, and the mean aPTTs ranged from 1.96 to 3.4 times the baseline. When argatroban was administered as a continuous infusion of 2 mcg/kg/min prior to and during a 4-hour hemodialysis session, approximately 20% was cleared through dialysis. Age, Gender: There are no clinically significant effects of age or gender on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (e.g., aPTT) of argatroban in adults. Drug-Drug Interactions Digoxin: In 12 healthy volunteers, intravenous infusion of argatroban (2 mcg/kg/min) over 5 days (study days 11 to 15) did not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of oral digoxin (0.375 mg daily for 15 days). Erythromycin: In 10 healthy subjects, orally administered erythromycin (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5) at 500 mg four times daily for 7 days had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of argatroban at a dose of 1 mcg/kg/min for 5 hours. These data suggest oxidative metabolism by CYP3A4/5 is not an important elimination pathway in vivo for argatroban. Aspirin and Acetaminophen: Drug-drug interactions have not been demonstrated between argatroban and concomitantly administered aspirin (162.5 mg orally given 26 and 2 hours prior to initiation of argatroban 1 mcg/kg/min over 4 hours) or acetaminophen (1,000 mg orally given 12, 6, and 0 hours prior to, and 6 and 12 hours subsequent to, initiation of argatroban1.5 mcg/kg/min over 18 hours)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc."], "substance_name": ["ARGATROBAN"], "effective_time": "20240411", "product_ndc": ["0143-9559", "0143-9674"], "brand_name": ["Argatroban"]}

The maximum plasma concentration (C max ) of edaravone was reached by the end of infusion. There was a trend of more than dose-proportional increase in area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and C max of edaravone. With multiple-dose administration, edaravone does not accumulate in plasma. RADICAVA ORS administered orally at the dose of 105 mg, under fasted conditions, was shown to demonstrate an equivalent AUC with RADICAVA (60 mg administered intravenously for 60 min) and C max not less than that of RADICAVA. RADICAVA ORS demonstrated similar pharmacokinetics following administration via feeding tubes and oral administration. In healthy subjects, RADICAVA ORS does not accumulate with once-daily administration, and the maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of edaravone is more than dose-proportional over the dose range of 30 to 300 mg (approximately 0.3 and 3 times the recommended dosage, respectively). Absorption RADICAVA ORS has a median time to maximum concentration (T max ) occurring at approximately 0.5 hour (range, 0.25 to 0.75 hours) after fasted oral administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is about 57% because of first pass effect when comparing RADICAVA ORS (105 mg oral suspension) and RADICAVA (60 mg intravenous formulation). Effect of Food Following oral administration RADICAVA ORS to healthy subjects 1 hour before or 8 hours after high-fat meals (800-1000 calories, 50% fat), 4 hours after low-fat meals (400-500 calories, 25% fat), or 2 hours after caloric supplement (250 calories, e.g., protein drink), the C max and AUC did not decrease significantly (less than 20% and 10% changes in C max and AUC, respectively) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Following oral administration of RADICAVA ORS to healthy subjects, the C max decreased by 82%, and the AUC decreased by 61% with a high-fat meal compared to fasted conditions. Following administration of RADICAVA ORS 4 hours after high-fat meals, the C max and AUC decreased by 44% and 24%, respectively. Following administration of RADICAVA ORS 2 hours after low-fat meals, the C max and AUC decreased by 45% and 21%, respectively. Distribution Edaravone is bound to human serum proteins (92%), mainly to albumin, with no concentration dependence in the range of 0.1 to 50 micromol/L. Edaravone has a mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of 63.1 L. Elimination The mean terminal elimination half-life of edaravone is approximately 4.5 to 9 hours. The half-lives of its metabolites are 3 to 6 hours. Following intravenous administration, the total clearance of edaravone is estimated to be 35.9 L/h. Metabolism Edaravone is metabolized to a sulfate conjugate and a glucuronide conjugate, which are not pharmacologically active. The glucuronide conjugation of edaravone involves multiple uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms (UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT1A10, UGT2B7, and UGT2B17). In human plasma, edaravone is mainly detected as the sulfate conjugate, which is presumed to be formed by sulfotransferases. RADICAVA ORS results in 1.3- and 1.7-fold higher exposures for both sulfate and glucuronide metabolites, respectively, when compared to RADICAVA because of first pass metabolism. Excretion In Japanese and Caucasian healthy volunteer studies, edaravone was excreted mainly in the urine as its glucuronide conjugate (60-80% of the dose up to 48 hours). Approximately 6-8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as the sulfate conjugate, and < 1% of the dose was recovered in the urine as the unchanged drug. In vitro studies suggest that the sulfate conjugate of edaravone is hydrolyzed back to edaravone, which is then converted to the glucuronide conjugate in the kidney before excretion into the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No age effect on edaravone pharmacokinetics has been found [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment Following single IV infusion of 30 mg edaravone (half the recommended dosage of RADICAVA) over 60 minutes, mean C max and AUC 0-\u221e of unchanged edaravone were 1.15- and 1.20-fold greater in the subjects with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), and were 1.25- and 1.29-fold greater in the subjects with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) when compared to subjects with normal renal function, respectively. These changes in exposures are not considered to be clinically significant and therefore no dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effects of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of edaravone have not been studied. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following single IV infusion of 30 mg edaravone (half of the recommended dose of RADICAVA) over 60 minutes, mean C max and AUC 0-\u221e of unchanged edaravone were 1.20- and 1.07-fold greater in the subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 or 6), were 1.24- and 1.14-fold greater in the subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), and were 1.20- and 1.19-fold greater in the subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 10 to 14) when compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, respectively. These changes in exposures are not considered to be clinically significant and therefore no dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment. Male and Female Patients No gender effect on edaravone pharmacokinetics has been found. Racial or Ethnic Groups There were no significant racial differences in C max and AUC of edaravone between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Drug Interaction Studies The pharmacokinetics of edaravone is not expected to be significantly affected by inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, UGTs or major transporters. Concomitant oral administration of edaravone 120 mg (higher than the recommended dose of 105 mg for ORS) with sildenafil (CYP3A4 substrate), rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate), and furosemide (OAT3 substrate) did not produce any changes in C max and AUC of these drugs. In vitro studies demonstrated that, at the recommended dosage, edaravone and its metabolites are not expected to significantly inhibit CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A), conjugating enzymes UGT1A1 and UGT2B7, or other transporters (P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K) in humans. Edaravone and its metabolites are not expected to induce CYP1A2, or CYP2B6, at the recommended dosage of edaravone.

Treatment with UPLIZNA reduces CD20+ B cell counts in blood by 8 days after infusion. In Study 1 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , CD20+ B-cell counts were reduced below the lower limit of normal by 4 weeks in 100% of patients treated with UPLIZNA and remained below the lower limit of normal in 94% of patients for 28 weeks after initiation of treatment. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of inebilizumab-cdon in NMOSD patients following intravenous administration of UPLIZNA was biphasic with a mean terminal half-life of 18 days.

{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ibutilide fumarate injection is indicated for the rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter of recent onset to sinus rhythm. Patients with atrial arrhythmias of longer duration are less likely to respond to ibutilide fumarate. The effectiveness of ibutilide has not been determined in patients with arrhythmias of more than 90 days in duration. LIFE-THREATENING ARRHYTHMIAS\u2014APPROPRIATE TREATMENT ENVIRONMENT Ibutilide fumarate can cause potentially fatal arrhythmias, particularly sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, usually in association with QT prolongation (torsades de pointes), but sometimes without documented QT prolongation. In registration studies, these arrhythmias, which require cardioversion, occurred in 1.7% of treated patients during, or within a number of hours of, use of Ibutilide fumarate. These arrhythmias can be reversed if treated promptly (see WARNINGS, Proarrhythmia ). It is essential that Ibutilide fumarate be administered in a setting of continuous ECG monitoring and by personnel trained in identification and treatment of acute ventricular arrhythmias, particularly polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Patients with atrial fibrillation of more than 2 to 3 days\u2019 duration must be adequately anticoagulated, generally for at least 2 weeks. CHOICE OF PATIENTS Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation have a strong tendency to revert after conversion to sinus rhythm (see CLINICAL STUDIES ) and treatments to maintain sinus rhythm carry risks. Patients to be treated with Ibutilide fumarate , therefore, should be carefully selected such that the expected benefits of maintaining sinus rhythm outweigh the immediate risks of Ibutilide fumarate , and the risks of maintenance therapy, and are likely to offer an advantage compared with alternative management."], "generic_name": ["IBUTILIDE FUMARATE"], "id": "478bb31d-6f88-4d45-9bc2-fea6e3728072", "route": ["INTRAVENOUS"], "description": ["DESCRIPTION Ibutilide Fumarate Injection is an antiarrhythmic drug with predominantly class III (cardiac action potential prolongation) properties according to the Vaughan Williams Classification.

The structural formula is represented below: structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ibutilide fumarate injection prolongs action potential duration in isolated adult cardiac myocytes and increases both atrial and ventricular refractoriness in vivo , ie, class III electrophysiologic effects. Voltage clamp studies indicate that ibutilide fumarate, at nanomolar concentrations, delays repolarization by activation of a slow, inward current (predominantly sodium), rather than by blocking outward potassium currents, which is the mechanism by which most other class III antiarrhythmics act. These effects lead to prolongation of atrial and ventricular action potential duration and refractoriness, the predominant electrophysiologic properties of ibutilide fumarate in humans that are thought to be the basis for its antiarrhythmic effect. Electrophysiologic Effects Ibutilide fumarate produces mild slowing of the sinus rate and atrioventricular conduction. Ibutilide fumarate produces no clinically significant effect on QRS duration at intravenous doses up to 0.03 mg/kg administered over a 10-minute period. Although there is no established relationship between plasma concentration and antiarrhythmic effect, ibutilide fumarate produces dose-related prolongation of the QT interval, which is thought to be associated with its antiarrhythmic activity. (see WARNINGS for relationship between QTc prolongation and torsades de pointes-type arrhythmias.) In a study in healthy volunteers, intravenous infusions of ibutilide fumarate resulted in prolongation of the QT interval that was directly correlated with ibutilide plasma concentration during and after 10-minute and 8-hour infusions. A steep ibutilide concentration/response (QT prolongation) relationship was shown. The maximum effect was a function of both the dose of ibutilide fumarate and the infusion rate. Hemodynamic Effects A study of hemodynamic function in patients with ejection fractions both above and below 35% showed no clinically significant effects on cardiac output, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at doses of ibutilide fumarate up to 0.03 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetics After intravenous infusion, ibutilide plasma concentrations rapidly decrease in a multiexponential fashion. The pharmacokinetics of ibutilide are highly variable among subjects. Ibutilide has a high systemic plasma clearance that approximates liver blood flow (about 29 mL/min/kg), a large steady-state volume of distribution (about 11 L/kg) in healthy volunteers, and minimal (about 40%) protein binding. Ibutilide is also cleared rapidly and highly distributed in patients being treated for atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. The elimination half-life averages about 6 hours (range from 2 to 12 hours). The pharmacokinetics of ibutilide are linear with respect to the dose of ibutilide fumarate over the dose range of 0.01 mg/kg to 0.10 mg/kg. The enantiomers of ibutilide fumarate have pharmacokinetic properties similar to each other and to ibutilide fumarate. The pharmacokinetics of ibutilide fumarate injection in patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation are similar regardless of the type of arrhythmia, patient age, sex, or the concomitant use of digoxin, calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers. Metabolism and elimination In healthy male volunteers, about 82% of a 0.01 mg/kg dose of [ 14 C] ibutilide fumarate was excreted in the urine (about 7% of the dose as unchanged ibutilide) and the remainder (about 19%) was recovered in the feces. Eight metabolites of ibutilide were detected in metabolic profiling of urine. These metabolites are thought to be formed primarily by \u03c9-oxidation followed by sequential \u03b2-oxidation of the heptyl side chain of ibutilide. Of the eight metabolites, only the \u03c9-hydroxy metabolite possesses class III electrophysiologic properties similar to that of ibutilide in an in vitro isolated rabbit myocardium model. The plasma concentrations of this active metabolite, however, are less than 10% of that of ibutilide. Clinical Studies Treatment with intravenous ibutilide fumarate for acute termination of recent onset atrial flutter/fibrillation was evaluated in 466 patients participating in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Patients had their arrhythmias for 3 hours to 90 days, were anticoagulated for at least 2 weeks if atrial fibrillation was present more than 3 days, had serum potassium of at least 4 mEq/L and QTc below 440 msec, and were monitored by telemetry for at least 24 hours. Patients could not be on class I or other class III antiarrhythmics (these had to be discontinued at least 5 half-lives prior to infusion) but could be on calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, or digoxin. In one trial, single 10-minute infusions of 0.005 to 0.025 mg/kg were tested in parallel groups (0.3 to 1.5 mg in a 60 kg person). In the second trial, up to two infusions of ibutilide fumarate were evaluated\u2014the first 1.0 mg, the second given 10 minutes after completion of the first infusion, either 0.5 or 1 mg. In a third double-blind study, 319 patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter of 3 hours to 45 days duration were randomized to receive single, 10-minute intravenous infusions of either sotalol (1.5 mg/kg) or ibutilide fumarate (1 mg or 2 mg). Among patients with atrial flutter, 53% receiving 1 mg ibutilide fumarate and 70%receiving 2 mg ibutilide fumarate converted, compared to 18% of those receiving sotalol. In patients with atrial fibrillation, 22% receiving 1 mg ibutilide fumarate and 43% receiving 2 mg ibutilide fumarate converted compared to 10% of patients receiving sotalol. Patients in registration trials were hemodynamically stable. Patients with specific cardiovascular conditions such as symptomatic heart failure, recent acute myocardial infarction, and angina were excluded. About two thirds had cardiovascular symptoms, and the majority of patients had left atrial enlargement, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, a history of valvular disease, or previous history of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Electrical cardioversion was allowed 90 minutes after the infusion was complete. Patients could be given other antiarrhythmic drugs 4 hours postinfusion. Results of the first two studies are shown in the tables below. Conversion of atrial flutter/ fibrillation usually (70% of those who converted) occurred within 30 minutes of the start of infusion and was dose related. The latest conversion seen was at 90 minutes after the start of the infusion. Most converted patients remained in normal sinus rhythm for 24 hours. Overall responses in these patients, defined as termination of arrhythmias for any length of time during or within 1 hour following completed infusion of randomized dose, were in the range of 43% to 48% at doses above 0.0125 mg/kg (vs 2% for placebo). Twenty-four hour responses were similar. For these atrial arrhythmias, ibutilide was more effective in patients with flutter than fibrillation (\u2265 48% vs \u2264 40%).

The numbers of patients who remained in the converted rhythm at the end of 24 hours were slightly less than those patients who converted initially, but the difference between conversion rates for ibutilide compared to placebo was still statistically significant. In long-term follow-up, approximately 40 % of all patients remained recurrence free, usually with chronic prophylactic treatment, 400 to 500 days after acute treatment, regardless of the method of conversion. Patients with more recent onset of arrhythmia had a higher rate of conversion. Response rates were 42% and 50% for patients with onset of atrial fibrillation/flutter for less than 30 days in the two efficacy studies compared to 16% and 31% in those with more chronic arrhythmias. Ibutilide was equally effective in patients below and above 65 years of age and in men and women. Female patients constituted about 20% of patients in controlled studies. Post-cardiac Surgery In a double-blind, parallel group study, 302 patients with atrial fibrillation (n=201) or atrial flutter (n=101) that occurred 1 to 7 days after coronary artery bypass graft or valvular surgery and lasted 1 hour to 3 days were randomized to receive two 10-minute infusions of placebo, or 0.25, 0.5 or 1 mg of ibutilide fumarate. Among patients with atrial flutter, conversion rates at 1.5 hours were: placebo, 4%; 0.25 mg ibutilide fumarate, 56%; 0.5 mg ibutilide fumarate, 61%; and 1 mg ibutilide fumarate, 78%. Among patients with atrial fibrillation, conversion rates at 1.5 hours were: placebo, 20%; 0.25 mg ibutilide fumarate, 28%; 0.5 mg ibutilide fumarate, 42%, and 1 mg ibutilide fumarate, 44%. The majority of patients (53% and 72% in the 0.5-mg and 1-mg dose groups, respectively) converted to sinus rhythm remained in sinus rhythm for 24 hours.

HbA T87Q has similar oxygen-binding affinity and oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve to wild type HbA, reduces intracellular and total hemoglobin S (HbS) levels, and is designed to sterically inhibit polymerization of HbS thereby limiting the sickling of red blood cells. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics HbA T87Q generally increased steadily after LYFGENIA infusion and stabilized by approximately Month 6 after infusion. Patients had a Month 6 median (min, max) HbA T87Q of 5.2 (2.6, 8.8) g/dL in an ongoing Phase 1/2 Study Group C (Study 1-C) (N = 33). HbA T87Q remained durable with a median (min, max) of 5.5 (2.4, 9.4) g/dL at Month 24 (N = 34).

Alpha 2 selectivity was observed in animals following slow intravenous infusion of low and medium doses (10 mcg/kg to 300 mcg/kg). Both alpha 1 and alpha 2 activity is observed following slow intravenous infusion of high doses (greater than or equal to 1000 mcg/kg) or with rapid intravenous administration. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a study in healthy adult volunteers (N = 10), respiratory rate and oxygen saturation remained within normal limits and there was no evidence of respiratory depression when dexmedetomidine was administered by intravenous infusion at doses within the recommended dose range (0.2\u20130.7 mcg/kg/hr). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration to adults, dexmedetomidine exhibits the following pharmacokinetic parameters: a rapid distribution phase with a distribution half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 6 minutes; a terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 2 hours; and steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of approximately 118 liters. Clearance is estimated to be approximately 39 L/hour. The mean body weight associated with this clearance estimate was 72 kg. Dexmedetomidine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in the dosage range of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr when administered to adults by intravenous infusion for up to 24 hours. Table 8 shows the main pharmacokinetic parameters when dexmedetomidine was infused (after appropriate loading doses) at maintenance infusion rates of 0.17 mcg/kg/hr (target plasma concentration of 0.3 ng/mL) for 12 and 24 hours, 0.33 mcg/kg/hr (target plasma concentration of 0.6 ng/mL) for 24 hours, and 0.70 mcg/kg/hr (target plasma concentration of 1.25 ng/mL) for 24 hours.

The mean Css was calculated based on post-dose sampling from 2.5 to 9 hours samples for 12 hour infusion and post-dose sampling from 2.5 to 18 hours for 24 hour infusions. The loading doses for each of the above indicated groups were 0.5, 0.5, 1 and 2.2 mcg/kg, respectively. Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetic parameters in adults after dexmedetomidine maintenance doses of 0.2 to 1.4 mcg/kg/hr for >24 hours were similar to the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters after dexmedetomidine maintenance dosing for < 24 hours in other studies. The values for clearance (CL), volume of distribution (V), and t 1/2 were 39.4 L/hr, 152 L, and 2.67 hours, respectively. Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of dexmedetomidine was approximately 118 liters. Dexmedetomidine protein binding was assessed in the plasma of normal healthy male and female subjects. The average protein binding was 94% and was constant across the different plasma concentrations tested. Protein binding was similar in males and females. The fraction of dexmedetomidine that was bound to plasma proteins was significantly decreased in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. The potential for protein binding displacement of dexmedetomidine by fentanyl, ketorolac, theophylline, digoxin and lidocaine was explored in vitro , and negligible changes in the plasma protein binding of dexmedetomidine were observed. The potential for protein binding displacement of phenytoin, warfarin, ibuprofen, propranolol, theophylline and digoxin by dexmedetomidine was explored in vitro and none of these compounds appeared to be significantly displaced by dexmedetomidine. Elimination Metabolism Dexmedetomidine undergoes almost complete biotransformation with very little unchanged dexmedetomidine excreted in urine and feces. Biotransformation involves both direct glucuronidation as well as cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism. The major metabolic pathways of dexmedetomidine are: direct N-glucuronidation to inactive metabolites; aliphatic hydroxylation (mediated primarily by CYP2A6 with a minor role of CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19) of dexmedetomidine to generate 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, the glucuronide of 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, and 3-carboxy-dexmedetomidine; and N-methylation of dexmedetomidine to generate 3-hydroxy N-methyl-dexmedetomidine, 3-carboxy N-methyl-dexmedetomidine, and dexmedetomidine-N-methyl O-glucuronide. Excretion The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of dexmedetomidine is approximately 2 hours and clearance is estimated to be approximately 39 L/h. A mass balance study demonstrated that after nine days an average of 95% of the radioactivity, following intravenous administration of radiolabeled dexmedetomidine, was recovered in the urine and 4% in the feces. No unchanged dexmedetomidine was detected in the urine. Approximately 85% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was excreted within 24 hours after the infusion. Fractionation of the radioactivity excreted in urine demonstrated that products of N-glucuronidation accounted for approximately 34% of the cumulative urinary excretion. In addition, aliphatic hydroxylation of parent drug to form 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, the glucuronide of 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, and 3-carboxylic acid-dexmedetomidine together represented approximately 14% of the dose in urine. N-methylation of dexmedetomidine to form 3-hydroxy N-methyl dexmedetomidine, 3-carboxy N-methyl dexmedetomidine, and N-methyl O-glucuronide dexmedetomidine accounted for approximately 18% of the dose in urine. The N-Methyl metabolite itself was a minor circulating component and was undetected in urine. Approximately 28% of the urinary metabolites have not been identified. Specific Populations Male and Female Patients There was no observed difference in dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics due to sex. Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profile of dexmedetomidine was not altered by age. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine in young (18\u201340 years), middle age (41\u201365 years), and elderly (>65 years) subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In adult subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C), clearance values for dexmedetomidine were lower than in healthy subjects. The mean clearance values for patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment were 74%, 64% and 53% of those observed in the normal healthy adult subjects, respectively. Mean clearances for free drug were 59%, 51% and 32% of those observed in the normal healthy adult subjects, respectively. Although dexmedetomidine is dosed to effect, it may be necessary to consider dose reduction in subjects with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Patients with Renal Impairment Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics (Cmax, Tmax, AUC, t1/2, CL, and Vss) were not significantly different in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance: <30 mL/min) compared to healthy subjects.

A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% - 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem readily penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-bindingprotein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus. Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one-carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. The mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis, pJIA, and in psoriasis is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution After intravenous administration, the initial volume of distribution is approximately 0.18 L/kg (18% of body weight) and steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 0.4 L/to 0.8 L/kg (40% to 80% of body weight). Methotrexate competes with reduced folates for active transport across cell membranes by means of a single carrier-mediated active transport process. At serum concentrations greater than 100 micromolar, passive diffusion becomes a major pathway by which effective intracellular concentrations can be achieved. Methotrexate in serum is approximately 50% protein bound. Methotrexate may be displaced from plasma albumin by various compounds, including sulfonamides, salicylates, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and phenytoin. Methotrexate does not penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in therapeutic amounts when given intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Elimination The terminal half-life reported for methotrexate is approximately 3 to 10 hours for patients receiving treatment for psoriasis, or rheumatoid arthritis or low-dose antineoplastic therapy (less than 30 mg/m 2 ). Following intravenous administration of high-dose methotrexate, the terminal half-life is 8 hours to 15 hours. Metabolism Methotrexate undergoes hepatic and intracellular metabolism to polyglutamated forms that can be converted back to methotrexate by hydrolase enzymes. These polyglutamates act as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthetase. Small amounts of methotrexate polyglutamates may remain in tissues for extended periods. The retention and prolonged drug action of these active metabolites vary among different cells, tissues, and tumors. Methotrexate undergoes minor metabolism to 7-hydroxymethotrexate, and accumulation may become significant following high dosages. The aqueous solubility of 7-hydroxymethotrexate is 3- to 5-fold lower than the solubility of methotrexate. Excretion Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is dependent upon dosage and route of administration. With intravenous administration, 80% to 90% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. There is limited biliary excretion amounting to 10% or less of the administered dose. Enterohepatic recirculation of methotrexate has been proposed. Renal excretion occurs by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Nonlinear elimination due to saturation of renal tubular reabsorption has been observed in psoriatic patients at doses between 7.5 mg and 30 mg.

Mannitol hinders tubular reabsorption of water and enhances excretion of sodium and chloride by elevating the osmolarity of the glomerular filtrate. This increase in extracellular osmolarity affected by the intravenous administration of mannitol will induce the movement of intracellular water to the extracellular and vascular spaces. This action underlies the role of mannitol in reducing intracranial pressure, intracranial edema, and intraocular pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Mannitol distributes largely in the extracellular space in 20 to 40 minutes after intravenous administration. The volume of distribution of mannitol is approximately 17 L in adults. Elimination In subjects with normal renal function, the total clearance is 87 to 109 mL/min. The elimination half-life of mannitol is 0.5 to 2.5 hours. Metabolism Only relatively small amount of the dose administered is metabolized after intravenous administration of mannitol to healthy subjects.

Heparin Sodium Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Heparin interacts with the naturally occurring plasma protein, Antithrombin III, to induce a conformational change, which markedly enhances the serine protease activity of Antithrombin III, thereby inhibiting the activated coagulation factors involved in the closing sequence, particularly Xa and IIa. Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Various times (activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time) are prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, they are not measurably affected by low doses of heparin. Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Heparin is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore administered via parenteral route. Peak plasma concentration and the onset of action are achieved immediately after intravenous administration. Distribution Heparin is highly bound to antithrombin, fibrinogens, globulins, serum proteases and lipoproteins. The volume of distribution is 0.07 L/kg. Elimination Metabolism Heparin does not undergo enzymatic degradation. Excretion Heparin is mainly cleared from the circulation by liver and reticuloendothelial cells mediated uptake into extravascular space. Heparin undergoes biphasic clearance, a) rapid saturable clearance (zero order process due to binding to proteins, endothelial cells and macrophages) and b) slower first order elimination. Low doses of heparin are cleared mostly by a saturable, rapid, zero-order process. Slower first order elimination usually occurs with very high doses of heparin and is dependent on renal function.

The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin.

Clofarabine has affinity for the activating phosphorylating enzyme, deoxycytidine kinase, equal to or greater than that of the natural substrate, deoxycytidine. Clofarabine inhibits DNA synthesis by decreasing cellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools through an inhibitory action on ribonucleotide reductase, and by terminating DNA chain elongation and inhibiting repair through incorporation into the DNA chain by competitive inhibition of DNA polymerases. Theaffinity of clofarabine triphosphate for these enzymes is similar to or greater than that of deoxyadenosine triphosphate. In preclinical models, clofarabine has demonstrated the ability to inhibit DNA repair by incorporation into the DNA chain during the repair process. Clofarabine 5\u2019-triphosphate also disrupts the integrity of mitochondrial membrane, leading to the release of the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor, leading to programmed cell death.

At the given 52 mg/m 2 dose, similar concentrations were obtained over a wide range of body surface areas (BSAs). Clofarabine was 47% bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to albumin. Based on non-compartmental analysis, systemic clearance and volume of distribution at steady\u00adstate were 28.8 L/h/m 2 and 172 L/m 2 , respectively. The terminal half-life was 5.2 hours. No apparent difference in pharmacokinetics was observed between patients with ALL and AML or between males and females. No relationship between clofarabine or clofarabine triphosphate exposure and toxicity or response was found in this population. Based on 24-hour urine collections in the pediatric studies, 49% to 60% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged. In vitr o studies using isolated human hepatocytes indicate very limited metabolism (0.2%). The pathways of non-hepatic elimination remain unknown. Clofarabine has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment Drug-Drug Interactions In vitro studies suggested that clofarabine undergoes limited metabolism and does not inhibit or induce major CYP enzymes. CYP inhibitors and inducers are unlikely to affect the metabolism of clofarabine. Clofarabine is unlikely to affect the metabolism of CYP substrates. However, no in vivo drug interaction studies have been conducted. An in vitro transporter study suggested that clofarabine is a substrate of human transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OCT1. A preclinical study using perfused rat kidney demonstrated that the renal excretion of clofarabine was decreased by cimetidine, an inhibitor of the hOCT2. Although the clinical implications of this finding have not been determined, signs of clofarabine injection toxicity should be monitored when administered with other hOAT1, hOAT3, hOCT1 and hOCT2 substrates or inhibitors."], "manufacturer_name": ["Dr.Reddy's Laboratories Inc"], "substance_name": ["CLOFARABINE"], "effective_time": "20240227", "product_ndc": ["43598-309"], "brand_name": ["Clofarabine"]}

Each milliliter contains 37 MBq (1 mCi) Thallous Chloride Tl 201 at calibration time, made isotonic with 9 milligrams sodium chloride and preserved with 0.9% (v/v) benzyl alcohol. The pH is adjusted to between 4.5 to 7.0 with hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide. Thallium Tl-201 is cyclotron produced. At the time of calibration it contains no more than 1.0% thallium Tl-200, no more than 1.0% thallium Tl-202, no more than 0.25% lead Pb-203, and no less than 98% thallium Tl-201 as a percentage of total activity. No carrier has been added. It is recommended to administer Thallous Chloride Tl 201 Injection close to calibration time to minimize the effect of higher levels of radionuclidic contaminants present at pre- and post-calibration dates. The concentration of each radionuclidic contaminant changes with time. Figure 1 shows maximum concentration of each radionuclidic contaminant as a function of time. Figure 1. Radionuclidic Contaminants figure 1 11.2 Physical Characteristics Thallium Tl-201, with a physical half-life of 72.9 hours, decays by electron capture to mercury Hg-201. Photons that are useful for detection and imaging are listed in Table 3. The lower energy x-rays obtained from the mercury Hg-201 daughter of thallium Tl-201 are recommended for myocardial imaging, because the mean percent disintegration at 68.9 to 80.3 keV is much greater than the combination of gamma-4 and gamma-6 mean percent disintegration.

The first half-value thickness of lead (Pb) is 0.0006 cm. A range of values for the radiation emitted by this radionuclide with the corresponding exposure rate at 1 cm that results from interposition of various thicknesses of lead is shown in Table 4. For example, the use of 0.21 cm of lead will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of about 1,000. Table 4.

Experiments in human volunteers using labeled microspheres have shown that the myocardial distribution of Thallous Chloride Tl 201 correlates well with regional perfusion. In clinical studies, Thallous Chloride Tl 201 images have been found to visualize areas of infarction as \u201ccold\u201d or nonlabeled regions which are confirmed by electrocardiographic and enzyme changes. Regions of transient myocardial ischemia corresponding to areas perfused by coronary arteries with partial stenoses have been visualized when Thallous Chloride Tl 201 was administered in conjunction with an exercise stress test. Anatomic configurations may interfere with visualization of the right coronary artery. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous administration, Thallous Chloride Tl 201 clears rapidly from the blood with maximal concentration by normal myocardium occurring at about 10 minutes. It will, in addition, localize in parathyroid adenomas; it is not specific since it will localize to a lesser extent in sites of parathyroid hyperplasia and other abnormal tissues such as thyroid adenoma, neoplasia (e.g., parathyroid carcinoma) and sarcoid. Biodistribution is generally proportional to organ blood flow at the time of injection. Blood clearance of Thallous Chloride Tl 201 is primarily by the myocardium, thyroid, liver, kidneys and stomach with the remainder distributing fairly uniformly throughout the body. The dosimetry data in Table 1 reflect this distribution pattern and are based on a biological half-life of 2.4 days. Thallous Chloride Tl 201 is excreted slowly and to an equal extent in both feces and urine. Five minutes after intravenous administration only 5 to 8 percent of injected activity remained in the blood. A biexponential disappearance curve was obtained, with 91.5 percent of the blood radioactivity disappearing with a half-time of about 5 minutes. The remainder had a half-time of about 40 hours. Approximately 4 to 8 percent of the injected dose was excreted in the urine in the first 24 hours. The whole body disappearance half-time was 9.8 \u00b1 2.5 days. Kidney concentration was found to be about 3 percent of the injected activity and the testicular content was 0.15 percent. Net thyroid activity was determined to be only 0.2 percent of the injected dose, and the activity disappeared in 24 hours. From anterior and posterior whole-body scans, it was determined that about 45 percent of the injected dose was in the large intestines and contiguous structures (liver, kidneys, abdominal musculature)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Curium US LLC"], "substance_name": ["THALLOUS CHLORIDE TL-201"], "effective_time": "20241007", "product_ndc": ["69945-120"], "brand_name": ["THALLOUS CHLORIDE Tl 201"]}

Transcription of this transgene occurs within the liver, using a liver-specific promoter, which results in the expression of hFVIII-SQ. The expressed hFVIII-SQ replaces the missing coagulation factor VIII needed for effective hemostasis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following ROCTAVIAN infusion, vector DNA is processed in vivo to form full-length, episomal transgenes that increase circulating hFVIII-SQ up to 5 years. Liver samples from 5 patients in clinical studies collected 0.5-4.1 years post-dose were analyzed. Vector integration into human genomic DNA was observed in all samples. No preferential integration of the vector and no clonal outgrowth of cells as a result of vector integration was observed. ROCTAVIAN can also insert into DNA of other human body cells; vector insertion into parotid gland DNA samples without associated clinical manifestations was observed in one patient treated with ROCTAVIAN . Factor VIII Activity The pharmacodynamic effect of ROCTAVIAN was assessed by measuring circulating factor VIII activity levels. Factor VIII activity levels (IU/dL) over time post-ROCTAVIAN infusion in ITT population are reported by both the CSA and OSA. The mean factor VIII activity levels at Month 36 was 18.2 IU/dL (95% CI: 12.9, 23.4) using the CSA, a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) improvement from 1 IU/dL at baseline.

The mean (SD) peak factor VIII activity levels measured by chromogenic assay were 37.2 (27.5) IU/dL and 90.8 (84.5) IU/dL for Black patients and patients of other races (Asian, White and others). Given the small sample size, the limited number of sites enrolling Black patients relative to the total population, the existence of potential confounding factors, and multiple posthoc analyses, this trend was insufficient to allow meaningful conclusions about the differences in response rates based on race or other factors therein influencing factor VIII expression following ROCTAVIAN infusion. Despite differences in factor VIII activity levels, ABR and annualized factor VIII usage was similar across races. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Biodistribution (within the body) and Vector Shedding (excretion/secretion) Valoctocogene roxaparvovec-rvox transgene DNA levels (total amount of vector DNA) in various tissues (evaluated in nonclinical studies), blood, and shedding matrices were determined using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. This assay is sensitive to transgene DNA, including fragments of degraded DNA. It does not indicate whether DNA is present in the vector capsid, in cells or in the fluid phase of the matrix (e.g., blood plasma, seminal fluid), or whether intact vector is present. Plasma and semen matrices were further evaluated by measuring encapsidated (potentially infectious) vector DNA using an immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR assay in Studies 270-201 and 270-301. Nonclinical Data Biodistribution of ROCTAVIAN was assessed in adult male mice. Following intravenous administration of 2.1 \u00d7 10 14 vg/kg, the highest vector DNA concentration was detected in the liver, followed by lower levels in the lung, heart, lymph nodes, kidney, spleen, bone marrow, testis, and brain through six months post-administration. The expression of the hFVIII mRNA transcripts were primarily detected in the liver, with no or minimal expression in extrahepatic tissues. Clinical Data ROCTAVIAN biodistribution and vector shedding were investigated on samples from blood, saliva, semen, stool, and urine. Administration of ROCTAVIAN at the dose of 6 \u00d7 10 13 vg/kg resulted in detectable vector DNA in blood and all shedding matrices evaluated at the dose of 6 \u00d7 10 13 vg/kg, with peak concentrations observed between 1 and 9 days post-administration. The peak vector DNA concentrations were observed in blood, followed by saliva, semen, stool, and urine. The peak concentration observed to date in blood across two clinical studies was 2 \u00d7 10 11 vg/mL. The maximum concentration observed in any shedding matrix was 1 \u00d7 10 10 vg/mL. After reaching the maximum in a matrix, the transgene DNA concentration declines steadily. In patients treated in two clinical studies, encapsidated (potentially transmissible) vector DNA was detectable in plasma up to 10 weeks after ROCTAVIAN administration. All patients treated in clinical studies achieved the first of 3 consecutive measurements below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for vector DNA in semen by 36 weeks, and all except one patient achieved 3 consecutive measurements below limit of detection (BLOD) or negative by the time of the data cut. The maximum time to the first of 3 consecutive measurements BLOD for encapsidated (potentially transmissible) vector DNA in semen was 12 weeks. In clinical studies, all patients achieved 3 consecutive measurements below the LLOQ for vector DNA in urine and saliva, and 126 (89%) patients achieved 3 consecutive measurements below the LLOQ for vector DNA in stool by the time of the data cut. The maximum time to the first of 3 consecutive LLOQ measurements was 8 weeks for urine, 52 weeks for saliva, and 131 weeks for stool. All patients in the first study achieved 3 consecutive measurements BLOD or negative in urine, saliva, and stool by five-year post-dosing. All patients in the second study achieved 3 consecutive measurements BLOD or negative in urine, and saliva, and 85 (63%) patients achieved 3 consecutive measurements BLOD or negative in stool by three-year data cut. Magnitude and duration of shedding appear to be independent of the patient's attained factor VIII activity. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of ROCTAVIAN or of other adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy products. In clinical studies, all patients receiving treatment were required to screen negative for anti-AAV5 antibodies and negative (< 0.6 BU) for factor VIII inhibitors in a Nijmegen modified Bethesda assay following a lifetime minimum of 150 exposure days to factor VIII replacement therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Following infusion of ROCTAVIAN, all patients remained negative for factor VIII inhibitors. All patients seroconverted to anti-AAV5 antibody positive within 8 weeks of administration. Anti-AAV5 total antibody titers peaked by 36 weeks after administration with mean (SD) values of 12,528,983 (32,427,817), and remained stable until the last time point tested, Week 168 with mean (SD) values of 3,673,038 (3,344,713). ROCTAVIAN-treated patients were tested for cellular immune responses against the AAV5 capsid and the factor VIII transgene product using an IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay. AAV5 capsid-specific cellular immune responses were detected beginning at Week 2 following dose administration and often declined or reverted to negative over the first 52 weeks in the majority of patients with available data.

Docetaxel injection, USP requires NO prior dilution with a diluent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells that is essential for mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel binds to free tubulin and promotes the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly. This leads to the production of microtubule bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of microtubules, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells. Docetaxel's binding to microtubules does not alter the number of proto\ufb01laments in the bound microtubules, a feature which differs from most spindle poisons currently in clinical use. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel have been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20 mg/m\u00b2 to 115 mg/m\u00b2 in phase 1 studies. The area under the curve (AUC) was dose proportional following doses of 70 mg/m\u00b2 to 115 mg/m\u00b2 with infusion times of 1 to 2 hours. Docetaxel's pharmacokinetic pro\ufb01le is consistent with a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model, with half-lives for the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 phases of 4 min, 36 min, and 11.1 hr, respectively. Mean total body clearance was 21 L/h/m\u00b2. Distribution The initial rapid decline represents distribution to the peripheral compartments and the late (terminal) phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow ef\ufb02ux of docetaxel from the peripheral compartment. Mean steady state volume of distribution was 113 L. In vitro studies showed that docetaxel is about 94% protein bound, mainly to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, albumin, and lipoproteins. In three cancer patients, the in vitro binding to plasma proteins was found to be approximately 97%. Dexamethasone does not affect the protein binding of docetaxel. Metabolism In vitro drug interaction studies revealed that docetaxel is metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme, and its metabolism may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] . Elimination A study of 14C-docetaxel was conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in both the urine and feces following oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl ester group, but fecal excretion was the main elimination route. Within 7 days, urinary and fecal excretion accounted for approximately 6% and 75% of the administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in feces is excreted during the \ufb01rst 48 hours as 1 major and 3 minor metabolites with very small amounts (less than 8%) of unchanged drug. Specific Populations Effect of Age: A population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out after docetaxel treatment of 535 patients dosed at 100 mg/m\u00b2. Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by this analysis were very close to those estimated from phase 1 studies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was not in\ufb02uenced by age. Effect of Gender: The population pharmacokinetics analysis described above also indicated that gender did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Hepatic Impairment: The population pharmacokinetic analysis described above indicated that in patients with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver impairment (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN), total body clearance was lowered by an average of 27%, resulting in a 38% increase in systemic exposure (AUC). This average, however, includes a substantial range and there is, at present, no measurement that would allow recommendation for dose adjustment in such patients. Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminase and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with docetaxel. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Effect of Race: Mean total body clearance for Japanese patients dosed at the range of 10 mg/m 2 to 90 mg/m 2 was similar to that of European/American populations dosed at 100 mg/m 2 , suggesting no significant difference in the elimination of docetaxel in the two populations. Drug Interaction studies Effect of Ketoconazole: The effect of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was investigated in 7 cancer patients. Patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel (100 mg/m\u00b2 intravenous) alone or docetaxel (10 mg/m\u00b2 intravenous) in combination with ketoconazole (200 mg orally once daily for 3 days) in a crossover design with a 3-week washout period. The results of this study indicated that the mean dose-normalized AUC of docetaxel was increased 2.2-fold and its clearance was reduced by 49% when docetaxel was coadministration with ketoconazole [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Effect of Combination Therapies: \u25cf Dexamethasone: Docetaxel total body clearance was not modified by pretreatment with dexamethasone. \u25cf Cisplatin: Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that previously observed following monotherapy with docetaxel. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin in combination therapy with docetaxel was similar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \u25cf Cisplatin and Fluorouracil: The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid tumors had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual drug. \u25cf Prednisone: A population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma data from 40 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer indicated that docetaxel systemic clearance in combination with prednisone is similar to that observed following administration of docetaxel alone. \u25cf Cyclophosphamide and Doxorubicin: A study was conducted in 30 patients with advanced breast cancer to determine the potential for drug-drug interactions between docetaxel (75 mg/m\u00b2), doxorubicin (50 mg/m\u00b2), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m\u00b2) when administered in combination. The coadministration of docetaxel had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide when the three drugs were given in combination compared to coadministration of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide only. In addition, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide had no effect on docetaxel plasma clearance when the three drugs were given in combination compared to historical data for docetaxel monotherapy."], "manufacturer_name": ["Armas Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "substance_name": ["DOCETAXEL"], "effective_time": "20200114", "product_ndc": ["72485-216"], "brand_name": ["Docetaxel"]}

The electrolyte composition approaches that of the principal ions of normal plasma (extracellular fluid). The electrolyte concentration is approximately isotonic in relation to the extracellular fluid (approx. 280 mOsmol/liter) and provides a physiologic sodium to chloride ratio, normal plasma concentrations of potassium and magnesium and two bicarbonate alternates, acetate and gluconate. Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl \u2212 ) ions. Sodium (Na + ) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl \u2212 ) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl \u2212 ) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output. Potassium chloride in water dissociates to provide potassium (K + ) and chloride (Cl \u2212 ) ions. Potassium is the chief cation of body cells (160 mEq/liter of intracellular water). It is found in low concentration in plasma and extracellular fluids (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter in a healthy adult and child over 10 days old; 3.5 to 6.0 mEq/liter in a child less than 10 days old). Potassium plays an important role in electrolyte balance. Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium-free diet, potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion. Magnesium chloride in water dissociates to provide magnesium (Mg ++ ) and chloride (Cl \u2212 ) ions. Magnesium is the second most plentiful cation of the intracellular fluids. It is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Normal plasma concentration ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 or 3.0 mEq per liter. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration. Sodium acetate provides sodium (Na + ) and acetate (CH 3 COO \u2212 ) ions, the latter anion (a source of hydrogen ion acceptors) serving as an alternate source of bicarbonate (HCO 3 \u2212 ) by metabolic conversion in the liver. This has been shown to proceed readily even in the presence of severe liver disease. Thus, acetate anion exerts a mild systemic antiacidotic action that may be advantageous during fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy. Sodium gluconate provides sodium (Na + ) and gluconate (C 6 H 11 O 7 \u2212 ) ions. Although gluconate is a theoretical alternate metabolic source of bicarbonate (HCO 3 \u2212 ) anion, a significant antiacidotic action has not been established. Thus, the gluconate anion serves primarily to complete the cation-anion balance of the solutions. Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production). Average normal pediatric daily requirements are based on the child\u2019s weight as described in the table below: Weight Fluid Requirements Up to 10 kg 100 mL/kg 11 to 20 kg 1,000 mL + 50 mL/kg for each kg above 10 kg Above 20 kg 1,500 mL + 20 mL/kg for each kg above 20 kg Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells that is essential for mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel binds to free tubulin and promotes the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly. This leads to the production of microtubule bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of microtubules, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells. Docetaxel's binding to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments in the bound microtubules, a feature which differs from most spindle poisons currently in clinical use. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel has been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20 mg/m 2 to 115 mg/m 2 in phase 1 studies. The area under the curve (AUC) was dose proportional following doses of 70 mg/m 2 to 115 mg/m 2 with infusion times of 1 to 2 hours. Docetaxel's pharmacokinetic profile is consistent with a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model, with initial rapid distribution phase and the late (terminal) phase. Distribution Mean steady state volume of distribution was 113 L. Docetaxel is approximately 94% protein bound in vitro , mainly to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein, albumin, and lipoproteins. In three cancer patients, the in vitro binding to plasma proteins was approximately 97%. Dexamethasone does not affect the protein binding of docetaxel. Elimination With extended plasma sampling up to 8 to 22 days post infusion, the estimated mean total body clearance was 18 L/h/m 2 (range of means: 14 to 23) and mean terminal elimination half-life was 116 hours (range of means: 92 to 135). Metabolism Docetaxel is metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme in vitro [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Excretion In three cancer patients urinary and fecal excretion accounted for approximately 6% and 75% of the administered radioactivity, respectively, within 7 days. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in feces was excreted during the first 48 hours as 1 major and 3 minor metabolites with less than 8% as unchanged drug. Specific Populations Effect of Age : A population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out after docetaxel treatment of 535 patients dosed at 100 mg/m 2 . Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by this analysis were very close to those estimated from phase 1 studies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was not influenced by age. Effect of Gender : The population pharmacokinetics analysis described above also indicated that gender did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Hepatic Impairment : The population pharmacokinetic analysis described above indicated that in patients with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver impairment (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN), total body clearance was lowered by an average of 27%, resulting in a 38% increase in systemic exposure (AUC). This average, however, includes a substantial range and there is, at present, no measurement that would allow recommendation for dose adjustment in such patients. Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminase and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Effect of Race : Mean total body clearance for Japanese patients dosed at the range of 10 mg/m 2 to 90 mg/m 2 was similar to that of European/American populations dosed at 100 mg/m 2 , suggesting no significant difference in the elimination of docetaxel in the two populations. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Ketoconazole : The effect of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was investigated in 7 cancer patients. Patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel (100 mg/m 2 intravenous) alone or docetaxel (10 mg/m 2 intravenous) in combination with ketoconazole (200 mg orally once daily for 3 days) in a crossover design with a 3-week washout period. The results of this study indicated that the mean dose-normalized AUC of docetaxel was increased 2.2-fold and its clearance was reduced by 49% when docetaxel was co-administered with ketoconazole [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Effect of Combination Therapies : \u2022 Dexamethasone: Docetaxel total body clearance was not modified by pretreatment with dexamethasone. \u2022 Cisplatin: Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that previously observed following monotherapy with docetaxel. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin in combination therapy with docetaxel was similar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \u2022 Cisplatin and Fluorouracil: The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid tumors had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual drug. \u2022 Prednisone: A population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma data from 40 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer indicated that docetaxel systemic clearance in combination with prednisone is similar to that observed following administration of docetaxel alone. \u2022 Cyclophosphamide and Doxorubicin: A study was conducted in 30 patients with advanced breast cancer to determine the potential for drug-drug interactions between docetaxel (75 mg/m 2 ), doxorubicin (50 mg/m 2 ), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m 2 ) when administered in combination. The co-administration of docetaxel had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide when the three drugs were given in combination compared to co-administration of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide only. In addition, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide had no effect on docetaxel plasma clearance when the three drugs were given in combination compared to historical data for docetaxel monotherapy."], "manufacturer_name": ["Baxter Healthcare Corporation"], "substance_name": ["DOCETAXEL"], "effective_time": "20231121", "product_ndc": ["43066-001", "43066-006", "43066-010"], "brand_name": ["Docetaxel"]}

Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one-carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. The mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis, pJIA, and in psoriasis is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution After intravenous administration, the initial volume of distribution is approximately 0.18 L/kg (18% of body weight) and steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 0.4 L/to 0.8 L/kg (40% to 80% of body weight). Methotrexate competes with reduced folates for active transport across cell membranes by means of a single carrier-mediated active transport process. At serum concentrations greater than 100 micromolar, passive diffusion becomes a major pathway by which effective intracellular concentrations can be achieved. Methotrexate in serum is approximately 50% protein bound. Methotrexate may be displaced from plasma albumin by various compounds, including sulfonamides, salicylates, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and phenytoin. Methotrexate does not penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in therapeutic amounts when given intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Elimination The terminal half-life reported for methotrexate is approximately 3 to 10 hours for patients receiving treatment for psoriasis, or rheumatoid arthritis or low-dose antineoplastic therapy (less than 30 mg/m 2 ). Following intravenous administration of high-dose methotrexate, the terminal half-life is 8 hours to 15 hours. Metabolism Methotrexate undergoes hepatic and intracellular metabolism to polyglutamated forms that can be converted back to methotrexate by hydrolase enzymes. These polyglutamates act as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthetase. Small amounts of methotrexate polyglutamates may remain in tissues for extended periods. The retention and prolonged drug action of these active metabolites vary among different cells, tissues, and tumors. Methotrexate undergoes minor metabolism to 7-hydroxymethotrexate, and accumulation may become significant following high dosages. The aqueous solubility of 7-hydroxymethotrexate is 3- to 5-fold lower than the solubility of methotrexate. Excretion Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is dependent upon dosage and route of administration. With intravenous administration, 80% to 90% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. There is limited biliary excretion amounting to 10% or less of the administered dose. Enterohepatic recirculation of methotrexate has been proposed. Renal excretion occurs by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Nonlinear elimination due to saturation of renal tubular reabsorption has been observed in psoriatic patients at doses between 7.5 mg and 30 mg. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients receiving methotrexate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (6.3 mg/m 2 to 30 mg/m 2 ), or for JIA (3.75 mg/m 2 to 26.2 mg/m 2 ), the terminal half-life has been reported to range from 0.7 to 5.8 hours or from 0.9 to 2.3 hours, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Regadenoson is a low affinity agonist (K i \u2248 1.3 \u00b5M) for the A 2A adenosine receptor, with at least 10-fold lower affinity for the A 1 adenosine receptor (K i > 16.5 \u00b5M), and weak, if any, affinity for the A 2B and A 3 adenosine receptors. Activation of the A 2A adenosine receptor by regadenoson produces coronary vasodilation and increases coronary blood flow (CBF). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Coronary Blood Flow Regadenoson injection causes a rapid increase in CBF which is sustained for a short duration. In patients undergoing coronary catheterization, pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography was used to measure the average peak velocity (APV) of coronary blood flow before and up to 30 minutes after administration of regadenoson (0.4 mg, intravenously). Mean APV increased to greater than twice baseline by 30 seconds and decreased to less than twice the baseline level within 10 minutes [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Myocardial uptake of the radiopharmaceutical is proportional to CBF. Because regadenoson injection increases blood flow in normal coronary arteries with little or no increase in stenotic arteries, regadenoson injection causes relatively less uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in vascular territories supplied by stenotic arteries. MPI intensity after regadenoson injection administration is therefore greater in areas perfused by normal relative to stenosed arteries. Effect of duration of injection A study in dogs compared the effects of intravenous injection of 2.5 mcg/kg regadenoson (in 10 mL) over 10 seconds and 30 seconds on CBF. The duration of a two-fold increase in CBF was 97\u00b114 seconds (n=6) and 221\u00b120 seconds (n=4), respectively, for the 10 second and 30 second injections. The peak effects (i.e., maximal increase) on CBF after the 10 second and 30 second injections were 217\u00b115% and 297\u00b133% above baseline, respectively. The times to peak effect on CBF were 17\u00b12 seconds and 27\u00b16 seconds, respectively. Effect of Aminophylline Aminophylline (100 mg, administered by slow intravenous injection over 60 seconds) injected 1 minute after 0.4 mg regadenoson injection in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, was shown to shorten the duration of the coronary blood flow response to regadenoson injection as measured by pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography [see Overdosage (10) ] . Effect of Caffeine Ingestion of caffeine decreases the ability to detect reversible ischemic defects. In a placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical study, patients with known or suspected myocardial ischemia received a baseline rest/stress MPI followed by a second stress MPI. Patients received caffeine or placebo 90 minutes before the second regadenoson injection stress MPI. Following caffeine administration (200 or 400 mg), the mean number of reversible defects identified was reduced by approximately 60%. This decrease was statistically significant [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Hemodynamic Effects In clinical studies, the majority of patients had an increase in heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure within 45 minutes after administration of regadenoson injection. Maximum hemodynamic changes after regadenoson injection and adenosine injection in Studies 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 5.

In in vitro studies, regadenoson has not been shown to have appreciable binding affinity for the A 2B and A 3 adenosine receptors. In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 999 patients with a diagnosis, or risk factors for, coronary artery disease and concurrent asthma or COPD, the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions (dyspnea, wheezing) was greater with regadenoson injection compared to placebo. Moderate (2.5%) or severe (< 1%) respiratory reactions were observed more frequently in the regadenoson injection group compared to placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects, the regadenoson plasma concentration-time profile is multi-exponential in nature and best characterized by 3-compartment model. The maximal plasma concentration of regadenoson is achieved within 1 to 4 minutes after injection of regadenoson injection and parallels the onset of the pharmacodynamic response. The half-life of this initial phase is approximately 2 to 4 minutes. An intermediate phase follows, with a half-life on average of 30 minutes coinciding with loss of the pharmacodynamic effect. The terminal phase consists of a decline in plasma concentration with a half-life of approximately 2 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Within the dose range of 0.3\u201320 mcg/kg in healthy subjects, clearance, terminal half-life or volume of distribution do not appear dependent upon the dose. A population pharmacokinetic analysis including data from subjects and patients demonstrated that regadenoson clearance decreases in parallel with a reduction in creatinine clearance and clearance increases with increased body weight. Age, gender, and race have minimal effects on the pharmacokinetics of regadenoson. Specific Populations Renally Impaired Patients: The disposition of regadenoson was studied in 18 patients with various degrees of renal function and in 6 healthy subjects. With increasing renal impairment, from mild (CLcr 50 to < 80 mL/min) to moderate (CLcr 30 to < 50 mL/min) to severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), the fraction of regadenoson excreted unchanged in urine and the renal clearance decreased, resulting in increased elimination half-lives and AUC values compared to healthy subjects (CLcr \u2265 80 mL/min). However, the maximum observed plasma concentrations as well as volumes of distribution estimates were similar across the groups. The plasma concentration-time profiles were not significantly altered in the early stages after dosing when most pharmacologic effects are observed. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. Patients with End Stage Renal Disease: The pharmacokinetics of regadenoson in patients on dialysis has not been assessed; however, in an in vitro study regadenoson was found to be dialyzable. Hepatically Impaired Patients: The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of regadenoson has not been evaluated. Because greater than 55% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and factors that decrease clearance do not affect the plasma concentration in the early stages after dosing when clinically meaningful pharmacologic effects are observed, no dose adjustment is needed in patients with hepatic impairment. Geriatric Patients: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age has a minor influence on the pharmacokinetics of regadenoson. No dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients. Metabolism The metabolism of regadenoson is unknown in humans. Incubation with rat, dog, and human liver microsomes as well as human hepatocytes produced no detectable metabolites of regadenoson. Excretion In healthy volunteers, 57% of the regadenoson dose is excreted unchanged in the urine (range 19\u201377%), with an average plasma renal clearance around 450 mL/min, i.e., in excess of the glomerular filtration rate.

Dopamine HCl has a molecular weight of 189.64 and it has the following structural formula: Dopamine (also referred to as 3 hydroxytyramine) is a naturally occurring endogenous catecholamine. Dopamine hydrochloride injection is a clear, practically colorless, sterile, pyrogen-free, aqueous solution of dopamine HCl for intravenous infusion after dilution. Each milliliter of the 40 mg/mL preparation contains 40 mg of dopamine hydrochloride (equivalent to 32.31 mg of dopamine base). Each milliliter of preparation contains the following: Sodium metabisulfite 9 mg added as an antioxidant; citric acid, anhydrous 10 mg; and sodium citrate, dihydrate 5 mg added as a buffer. May contain additional citric acid and/or sodium citrate for pH adjustment. pH is 3.3 (2.5 to 5.0). Dopamine must be diluted in an appropriate sterile parenteral solution before intravenous administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Dopamine structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Dopamine is a natural catecholamine formed by the decarboxylation of 3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). It is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system, especially in the nigrostriatal tract, and in a few peripheral sympathetic nerves. Dopamine elicits its pharmacological action by activating dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, beta 1 receptors and alpha 1 receptors. The activation of different receptors leading to its effects are dependent on dopamine dose. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Dopamine\u2019s onset of action occurs within five minutes of intravenous administration and the duration of action is less than about ten minutes. Dopamine effects are dosage-dependent. At <5 mcg/kg/minute, dopamine HCl activates dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the renal, mesenteric, and coronary vasculature causing vasodilation. At 5 to 10 mcg/kg/minute, dopamine HCl activates beta-1 receptors enhancing heart rate and contractility. At >10 mcg/kg/minute, dopamine HCl activates alpha-1 receptors causing vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Following intravenous administration, dopamine is widely distributed in the body but does not cross the blood-brain barrier to a significant extent. Elimination The half-life of dopamine in adults is less than 2 minutes. Metabolism About 75% of dopamine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol O-methyl transferase (COMT) in the liver, kidney, and plasma to the inactive compounds homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and about 25% is metabolized to norepinephrine in the adrenergic nerve terminals. Excretion About 80% of dopamine is renally excreted as inactive metabolites within 24 hours. Dopamine is stored in vesicles or diffused back into the plasma. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients The reported clearance rate of dopamine in critically ill infants and pediatric patients ranged from 46 to 168 mL/kg/minute, with the higher values seen in the younger patients. The reported apparent volume of distribution in neonates was 0.6 to 4 L/kg, leading to an elimination half life of 5 to 11 minutes."], "manufacturer_name": ["Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc."], "substance_name": ["DOPAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240415", "product_ndc": ["0143-9252", "0143-9253", "0143-9254", "0143-9255"], "brand_name": ["Dopamine Hydrochloride"]}

Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK 1 ) receptors. Aprepitant has little or no affinity for serotonin (5-HT 3 ), dopamine, and corticosteroid receptors, the targets of existing therapies for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Aprepitant has been shown in animal models to inhibit emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, via central actions. Animal and human Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies with aprepitant have shown that it crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK 1 receptors. Animal and human studies have shown that aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5-HT 3 -receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin-induced emesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled, thorough QTc study, a single 200-mg dose of fosaprepitant (approximately 1.3 times the recommended dose) had no effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Aprepitant after Fosaprepitant Administration Following administration of a single intravenous 150-mg dose of fosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant administered as a 20-minute infusion to healthy subjects, the mean AUC 0-\u221e of aprepitant was 37.4 (\u00b114.8) mcg\u2022hr/mL and the mean maximal aprepitant concentration (C max ) was 4.2 (\u00b11.2) mcg/mL. Plasma concentrations of fosaprepitant are below the limits of quantification (10 ng/mL) within 30 minutes of the completion of infusion. Distribution Aprepitant is greater than 95% bound to plasma proteins. The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vd ss ) was approximately 70 L in humans. Aprepitant crosses the blood brain barrier in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Elimination Metabolism Fosaprepitant is converted to aprepitant in in vitro incubations with human liver preparations and in S9 preparations from multiple other human tissues including kidney, lung and ileum. Thus, it appears that the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant can occur in multiple extrahepatic tissues in addition to the liver. Aprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Metabolism is largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side chains. No metabolism by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, or CYP2E1 was detected. In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for approximately 24% of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single oral 300-mg dose of [ 14 C]-aprepitant, indicating a substantial presence of metabolites in the plasma. Seven metabolites of aprepitant, which are only weakly active, have been identified in human plasma. Excretion Following administration of a single intravenous 100-mg dose of [ 14 C]-fosaprepitant to healthy subjects, 57% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 45% in feces. Aprepitant is eliminated primarily by metabolism; aprepitant is not renally excreted. The apparent terminal half-life ranged from approximately 9 to 13 hours. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population Following oral administration of a single 125-mg dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 through 5, the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 21% higher on Day 1 and 36% higher on Day 5 in elderly (65 years and older) relative to younger adults. The C max was 10% higher on Day 1 and 24% higher on Day 5 in elderly relative to younger adults. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Age: Pediatric Population Single Dose Fosaprepitant for Injection Regimen: Simulated systemic exposures of aprepitant in patients 2 years to less than 12 years and observed systemic exposures in patients 6 months to less than 2 years and 12 to 17 years are shown in Table 9, including AUC 0-24hr , peak plasma concentration (C max ) on Day 1 and concentrations at the end of Day 1 (C 24 ), Day 2 (C 48 ) and Day 3 (C 72 ).

Sex Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant, ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg, the AUC 0-24hr and C max are 9% and 17% higher in females as compared with males. The half-life of aprepitant is approximately 25% lower in females as compared with males and T max occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. A population pharmacokinetic analysis of aprepitant in pediatric patients (6 months to 17 years) suggests that sex has no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant. Race/Ethnicity Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant, ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg, the AUC 0-24hr and Cmax are approximately 27% and 19% higher in Hispanics as compared with Caucasians. The AUC 0-24hr and C max were 74% and 47% higher in Asians as compared to Caucasians. There was no difference in AUC 0-24hr or C max between Caucasians and Blacks. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. A population pharmacokinetic analysis of aprepitant in pediatric patients (6 months to 17 years) suggests that race has no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant. Renal Impairment A single 240-mg oral dose of aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis. In patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC 0- \u221e of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound) decreased by 21% and C max decreased by 32%, relative to healthy subjects (creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault method). In patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis, the AUC 0- \u221e of total aprepitant decreased by 42% and C max decreased by 32%. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the AUC of pharmacologically active unbound drug was not significantly affected in patients with renal impairment compared with healthy subjects. Hemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2% of the dose was recovered in the dialysate. Hepatic Impairment Fosaprepitant is metabolized in various extrahepatic tissues; therefore hepatic impairment is not expected to alter the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant. Following administration of a single 125-mg oral dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3 to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6), the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 11% lower on Day 1 and 36% lower on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 10% higher on Day 1 and 18% higher on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. These differences in AUC 0-24hr are not considered clinically meaningful. There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Body Mass Index (BMI) For every 5 kg/m 2 increase in BMI, AUC 0-24hr and C max of aprepitant decrease by 9% and 10%. BMI of subjects in the analysis ranged from 18 kg/m 2 to 36 kg/m 2 . This change is not considered clinically meaningful. Drug Interactions Studies Fosaprepitant, given as a single 150-mg dose, is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, with no evidence of inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 observed on Day 4. The weak inhibition of CYP3A4 continues for 2 days after single dose administration of fosaprepitant. Aprepitant is a substrate, an inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9. Fosaprepitant or aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P-glycoprotein transporter. Effects of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Midazolam: Fosaprepitant 150 mg administered as a single intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC 0- \u221e of midazolam by approximately 1.8-fold on Day 1 and had no effect on Day 4 when midazolam was coadministered as a single oral dose of 2 mg on Days 1 and 4 [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone: Fosaprepitant administered as a single 150 mg intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC0-24hr of dexamethasone, administered as a single 8-mg oral dose on Days 1, 2, and 3, by approximately 2-fold on Days 1 and 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Methylprednisolone : When oral aprepitant as a 3-day regimen (125-mg/80-mg/80-mg) was administered with intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg on Day 1 and oral methylprednisolone 40 mg on Days 2 and 3, the AUC of methylprednisolone was increased by 1.34-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3 [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Chemotherapeutic agents: Docetaxel: In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant administered as a 3-day regimen (125-mg/80-mg/80-mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Vinorelbine: In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant administered as a 3-day regimen (125-mg/80-mg/80-mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine to a clinically significant degree. Oral contraceptives: When oral aprepitant was administered as a 3-day regimen (125-mg/80-mg/80-mg) with ondansetron and dexamethasone, and coadministered with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, the trough concentrations of both ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone were reduced by as much as 64% for 3 weeks post-treatment [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. CYP2C9 substrates (Warfarin, Tolbutamide): Warfarin: A single 125-mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to subjects who were stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy. Although there was no effect of oral aprepitant on the plasma AUC of R(+) or S(-) warfarin determined on Day 3, there was a 34% decrease in S(-) warfarin trough concentration accompanied by a 14% decrease in the prothrombin time (reported as International Normalized Ratio or INR) 5 days after completion of dosing with oral aprepitant [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Tolbutamide: Oral aprepitant, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of tolbutamide by 23% on Day 4, 28% on Day 8, and 15% on Day 15, when a single dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered prior to the administration of the 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant and on Days 4, 8, and 15. This effect was not considered clinically important. Other Drugs P-glycoprotein substrates: Aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P-glycoprotein transporter, as demonstrated by the lack of interaction of oral aprepitant with digoxin in a clinical drug interaction study. 5-HT3 antagonists: I n clinical drug interaction studies, aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron, granisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of dolasetron). Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant Rifampin: When a single 375-mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14-day regimen of 600 mg/day of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased approximately 11-fold and the mean terminal half-life decreased approximately 3-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Ketoconazole: When a single 125-mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Diltiazem: In a study in 10 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of 100 mg of fosaprepitant as an intravenous infusion with 120 mg of diltiazem, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor administered three times daily, resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the aprepitant AUC and a 1.4-fold increase in the diltiazem AUC. When fosaprepitant was administered with diltiazem, the mean maximum decrease in diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater than that observed with diltiazem alone [24.3 \u00b1 10.2 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 15.6 \u00b1 4.1 mm Hg without fosaprepitant]. The mean maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure was also greater after co-administration of diltiazem with fosaprepitant than administration of diltiazem alone [29.5 \u00b1 7.9 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 23.8 \u00b1 4.8 mm Hg without fosaprepitant]. Co-administration of fosaprepitant and diltiazem; however, did not result in any additional clinically significant changes in heart rate or PR interval, beyond those changes observed with diltiazem alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Paroxetine : Coadministration of once daily doses of oral aprepitant 170 mg, with paroxetine 20 mg once daily, resulted in a decrease in AUC by approximately 25% and C max by approximately 20% of both aprepitant and paroxetine. This effect was not considered clinically important. Additional pediatric use information is approved for Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC\u2019s EMEND (fosaprepitant) for injection.

Daptomycin for injection is not indicated for the treatment of left-sided infective endocarditis due to S. aureus . The clinical trial of daptomycin for injection in adult patients with S. aureus bloodstream infections included limited data from patients with left-sided infective endocarditis; outcomes in these patients were poor [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Daptomycin for injection has not been studied in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. Daptomycin for injection is not recommended in pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) observed in neonatal dogs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. 1.5 Usage Appropriate specimens for microbiological examination should be obtained in order to isolate and identify the causative pathogens and to determine their susceptibility to daptomycin. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of daptomycin for injection and other antibacterial drugs, daptomycin for injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information is available, it should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with daptomycin for injection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Daptomycin for Injection Administered over a 30-Minute Period in Adults The mean and standard deviation (SD) pharmacokinetic parameters of daptomycin at steady-state following intravenous (IV) administration of daptomycin for injection over a 30-minute period at 4 to 12 mg/kg every 24h to healthy young adults are summarized in Table 11 . Table 11: Mean (SD) Daptomycin Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Healthy Adult Volunteers at Steady-State Dose Daptomycin for injection was administered by IV infusion over a 30-minute period. Doses of daptomycin for injection in excess of 6 mg/kg have not been approved.

Steady-state trough concentrations were achieved by the third daily dose. The mean (SD) steady-state trough concentrations attained following the administration of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg every 24h were 5.9 (1.6), 6.7 (1.6), 10.3 (5.5), 12.9 (2.9), and 13.7 (5.2) mcg/mL, respectively. Daptomycin for Injection Administered over a 2-Minute Period in Adults Following IV administration of daptomycin for injection over a 2-minute period to healthy adult volunteers at doses of 4 mg/kg (N=8) and 6 mg/kg (N=12), the mean (SD) steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) values were 475 (71) and 701 (82) mcg\u2022h/mL, respectively. Values for maximum plasma concentration (C max ) at the end of the 2-minute period could not be determined adequately in this study. However, using pharmacokinetic parameters from 14 healthy adult volunteers who received a single dose of daptomycin for injection 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 30-minute period in a separate study, steady-state C max values were simulated for daptomycin for injection 4 and 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 2-minute period. The simulated mean (SD) steady-state C max values were 77.7 (8.1) and 116.6 (12.2) mcg/mL, respectively. Distribution Daptomycin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin, in a concentration-independent manner. The overall mean binding ranges from 90 to 93%. In clinical studies, mean serum protein binding in adult subjects with creatinine clearance (CL CR ) \u226530 mL/min was comparable to that observed in healthy adult subjects with normal renal function. However, there was a trend toward decreasing serum protein binding among subjects with CL CR <30 mL/min (88%), including those receiving hemodialysis (86%) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (84%). The protein binding of daptomycin in adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was similar to that in healthy adult subjects. The volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) of daptomycin in healthy adult subjects was approximately 0.1 L/kg and was independent of dose. Metabolism In in vitro studies, daptomycin was not metabolized by human liver microsomes. In 5 healthy adults after infusion of radiolabeled 14 C-daptomycin, the plasma total radioactivity was similar to the concentration determined by microbiological assay. Inactive metabolites were detected in urine, as determined by the difference between total radioactive concentrations and microbiologically active concentrations. In a separate study, no metabolites were observed in plasma on Day 1 following the administration of daptomycin for injection at 6 mg/kg to adult subjects. Minor amounts of three oxidative metabolites and one unidentified compound were detected in urine. The site of metabolism has not been identified. Excretion Daptomycin is excreted primarily by the kidneys. In a mass balance study of 5 healthy adult subjects using radiolabeled daptomycin, approximately 78% of the administered dose was recovered from urine based on total radioactivity (approximately 52% of the dose based on microbiologically active concentrations), and 5.7% of the administered dose was recovered from feces (collected for up to 9 days) based on total radioactivity. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Population-derived pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for infected adult patients (complicated skin and skin structure infections [cSSSI] and S. aureus bacteremia) and noninfected adult subjects with various degrees of renal function ( Table 12 ). Total plasma clearance (CL T ), elimination half-life (t 1/2 ), and volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) in patients with cSSSI were similar to those in patients with S. aureus bacteremia. Following administration of daptomycin for injection 4 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean CL T was 9%, 22%, and 46% lower among subjects and patients with mild (CL CR 50\u201380 mL/min), moderate (CL CR 30\u2013<50 mL/min), and severe (CL CR <30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, than in those with normal renal function (CL CR >80 mL/min). The mean steady-state systemic exposure (AUC), t 1/2 , and V ss increased with decreasing renal function, although the mean AUC for patients with CL CR 30\u201380 mL/min was not markedly different from the mean AUC for patients with normal renal function. The mean AUC for patients with CL CR <30 mL/min and for patients on dialysis (CAPD and hemodialysis dosed post-dialysis) was approximately 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, than for patients with normal renal function. The mean C max ranged from 60 to 70 mcg/mL in patients with CL CR \u226530 mL/min, while the mean C max for patients with CL CR <30 mL/min ranged from 41 to 58 mcg/mL. After administration of daptomycin for injection 6 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean C max ranged from 80 to 114 mcg/mL in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and was similar to that of patients with normal renal function.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 10 adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and compared with those in healthy adult volunteers (N=9) matched for gender, age, and weight. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were not altered in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is warranted when daptomycin for injection is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been evaluated. Gender No clinically significant gender-related differences in daptomycin pharmacokinetics have been observed. No dosage adjustment is warranted based on gender when daptomycin for injection is administered. Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 12 healthy elderly subjects (\u226575 years of age) and 11 healthy young adult controls (18 to 30 years of age). Following administration of a single 4 mg/kg dose of daptomycin for injection by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean total clearance of daptomycin was approximately 35% lower and the mean AUC 0-\u221e was approximately 58% higher in elderly subjects than in healthy young adult subjects. There were no differences in C max [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Obese Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 6 moderately obese (Body Mass Index [BMI] 25 to 39.9 kg/m 2 ) and 6 extremely obese (BMI \u226540 kg/m 2 ) adult subjects and controls matched for age, gender, and renal function. Following administration of daptomycin for injection by IV infusion over a 30-minute period as a single 4 mg/kg dose based on total body weight, the total plasma clearance of daptomycin normalized to total body weight was approximately 15% lower in moderately obese subjects and 23% lower in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The AUC 0-\u221e of daptomycin was approximately 30% higher in moderately obese subjects and 31% higher in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The differences were most likely due to differences in the renal clearance of daptomycin. No adjustment of daptomycin for injection dosage is warranted in obese patients. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric subjects was evaluated in 3 single-dose pharmacokinetic studies. In general, body weight-normalized total body clearance in pediatric patients was higher than in adults and increased with a decrease of age, whereas elimination half-life tends to decrease with a decrease of age. Body weight-normalized total body clearance and elimination half-life of daptomycin in children 2 to 6 years of age were similar at different doses. A study was conducted to assess safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric patients (1 to 17 years old, inclusive) with cSSSI caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Patients were enrolled into 4 age groups [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , and intravenous daptomycin for injection doses of 5 to 10 mg/kg once daily were administered. Following administration of multiple doses, daptomycin exposure (AUC ss and C max,ss ) was similar across different age groups after dose adjustment based on body weight and age ( Table 13 ).

A study was conducted to assess safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric patients with S. aureus bacteremia. Patients were enrolled into 3 age groups [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] , and intravenous doses of 7 to 12 mg/kg once daily were administered. Following administration of multiple doses, daptomycin exposure (AUC ss and C max,ss ) was similar across different age groups after dose adjustment based on body weight and age ( Table 14 ). Table 14: Mean (SD) of Daptomycin Pharmacokinetics in Bacteremia Pediatric Patients Age Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg/kg) Infusion Duration (min) AUC SS (mcg\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) V SS (mL) CL T (mL/h/kg) C max,ss (mcg/mL) 12 to 17 years (N=13) 7 30 656 (334) 7.5 (2.3) 6420 (1980) 12.4 (3.9) 104 (35.5) 7 to 11 years (N=19) 9 30 579 (116) 6.0 (0.8) 4510 (1470) 15.9 (2.8) 104 (14.5) 2 to 6 years (N=19) 12 60 620 (109) 5.1 (0.6) 2200 (570) 19.9 (3.4) 106 (12.8) AUC ss , area under the concentration-time curve at steady state; CL T , clearance normalized to body weight; V ss , volume of distribution at steady state; t \u00bd , terminal half-life. No patients 1 to <2 years of age were enrolled in the study. Simulation using a population pharmacokinetic model demonstrated that the AUCss of daptomycin in pediatric patients 1 to <2 years of age receiving 12 mg/kg once daily would be comparable to that in adult patients receiving 6 mg/kg once daily. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies In vitro studies with human hepatocytes indicate that daptomycin does not inhibit or induce the activities of the following human cytochrome P450 isoforms: 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. It is unlikely that daptomycin will inhibit or induce the metabolism of drugs metabolized by the P450 system. Aztreonam In a study in which 15 healthy adult subjects received a single dose of daptomycin for injection 6 mg/kg IV and a combination dose of daptomycin for injection 6 mg/kg IV and aztreonam 1 g IV, administered over a 30-minute period, the C max and AUC 0-\u221e of daptomycin were not significantly altered by aztreonam. Tobramycin In a study in which 6 healthy adult males received a single dose of daptomycin for injection 2 mg/kg IV, tobramycin 1 mg/kg IV, and both in combination, administered over a 30-minute period, the mean C max and AUC 0-\u221e of daptomycin were 12.7% and 8.7% higher, respectively, when daptomycin for injection was coadministered with tobramycin. The mean C max and AUC 0-\u221e of tobramycin were 10.7% and 6.6% lower, respectively, when tobramycin was coadministered with daptomycin for injection. These differences were not statistically significant. The interaction between daptomycin and tobramycin with a clinical dose of daptomycin for injection is unknown. Warfarin In 16 healthy adult subjects, administration of daptomycin for injection 6 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 5 days, with coadministration of a single oral dose of warfarin (25 mg) on the 5th day, had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug and did not significantly alter the INR (International Normalized Ratio). Simvastatin In 20 healthy adult subjects on a stable daily dose of simvastatin 40 mg, administration of daptomycin for injection 4 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 14 days (N=10) had no effect on plasma trough concentrations of simvastatin and was not associated with a higher incidence of adverse events, including skeletal myopathy, than in subjects receiving placebo once daily (N=10) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid (500 mg 4 times daily) and a single dose of daptomycin for injection 4 mg/kg by IV infusion over a 30-minute period in adults did not significantly alter the C max or AUC 0-\u221e of daptomycin. 12.4 Microbiology Daptomycin belongs to the cyclic lipopeptide class of antibacterials. Daptomycin has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of daptomycin encompasses most clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro . This has been demonstrated both by time-kill curves and by MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. Daptomycin maintained bactericidal activity in vitro against stationary phase S. aureus in simulated endocardial vegetations. The clinical significance of this is not known. Mechanism of Action Daptomycin binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death. Resistance The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is not fully understood. Currently, there are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to daptomycin. Interactions with Other Antibacterials In vitro studies have investigated daptomycin interactions with other antibacterials. Antagonism, as determined by kill curve studies, has not been observed. In vitro synergistic interactions of daptomycin with aminoglycosides, \u03b2-lactam antibacterials, and rifampin have been shown against some isolates of staphylococci (including some methicillin-resistant isolates) and enterococci (including some vancomycin\u2011resistant isolates). Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI in adult patients. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received daptomycin for injection at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial. S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis and Other Post-Approval Trials in Adults In subsequent clinical trials in adult patients, non-susceptible isolates were recovered. S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a compassionate-use trial and from 7 patients in the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . An E. faecium was isolated from a patient in a vancomycin-resistant enterococci trial. Antimicrobial Activity Daptomycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . Gram-Positive Bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant isolates) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis Streptococcus pyogenes The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for daptomycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of daptomycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-Positive Bacteria Corynebacterium jeikeium Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-resistant isolates) Enterococcus faecium (including vancomycin-resistant isolates) Staphylococcus epidermidis (including methicillin-resistant isolates) Staphylococcus haemolyticus Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for daptomycin, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Sintetica US LLC"], "substance_name": ["DAPTOMYCIN"], "effective_time": "20250207", "product_ndc": ["83090-011"], "brand_name": ["daptomycin"]}

Endocarditis: Due to S. aureus (penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant) and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Perioperative Prophylaxis: The prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection, USP preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively may reduce the incidence of certain postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures which are classified as contaminated or potentially contaminated (e.g., vaginal hysterectomy, and cholecystectomy in high-risk patients such as those older than 70 years, with acute cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, or common duct bile stones). The perioperative use of Cefazolin for Injection, USP may also be effective in surgical patients in whom infection at the operative site would present a serious risk (e.g., during open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty). The prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection, USP should usually be discontinued within a 24 hour period after the surgical procedure. In surgery where the occurrence of infection may be particularly devastating (e.g., open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty), the prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection, USP may be continued for 3 to 5 days following the completion of surgery. If there are signs of infection, specimens for cultures should be obtained for the identification of the causative organism so that appropriate therapy may be instituted. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Cefazolin for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

Studies in patients hospitalized with infections indicate that Cefazolin produces mean peak serum levels approximately equivalent to those seen in normal volunteers. Bile levels in patients without obstructive biliary disease can reach or exceed serum levels by up to 5 times; however, in patients with obstructive biliary disease, bile levels of Cefazolin for Injection are considerably lower than serum levels (< 1 mcg/mL). In synovial fluid, the level of Cefazolin for Injection becomes comparable to that reached in serum at about 4 hours after drug administration.

These metabolites interfere with the growth of susceptible rapidly proliferating malignant cells. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following IV administration, elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) ranges from 3 to 12 hours with total body clearance (CL) values of 4 to 5.6 L/h. Pharmacokinetics are linear over the dose range used clinically. When cyclophosphamide was administered at 4.0 g/m 2 over a 90 minutes infusion, saturable elimination in parallel with first-order renal elimination describe the kinetics of the drug. Absorption After oral administration, peak concentrations of cyclophosphamide occurred at one hour. Area under the curve ratio for the drug after oral and IV administration (AUC po : AUC iv ) ranged from 0.87 to 0.96. Distribution Approximately 20% of cyclophosphamide is protein bound, with no dose dependent changes. Some metabolites are protein bound to an extent greater than 60%. Volume of distribution approximates total body water (30 to 50 L). Metabolism The liver is the major site of cyclophosphamide activation. Approximately 75% of the administered dose of cyclophosphamide is activated by hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450s including CYP2A6, 2B6, 3A4, 3A5, 2C9, 2C18 and 2C19, with 2B6 displaying the highest 4-hydroxylase activity. Cyclophosphamide is activated to form 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, which is in equilibrium with its ring-open tautomer aldophosphamide. 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and aldophosphamide can undergo oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenases to form the inactive metabolites 4-ketocyclophosphamide and carboxyphosphamide, respectively. Aldophosphamide can undergo \u03b2-elimination to form active metabolites phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. This spontaneous conversion can be catalyzed by albumin and other proteins. Less than 5% of cyclophosphamide may be directly detoxified by side chain oxidation, leading to the formation of inactive metabolites 2-dechloroethylcyclophosphamide. At high doses, the fraction of parent compound cleared by 4-hydroxylation is reduced resulting in non-linear elimination of cyclophosphamide in patients. Cyclophosphamide appears to induce its own metabolism. Auto-induction results in an increase in the total clearance, increased formation of 4-hydroxyl metabolites and shortened t 1/2 values following repeated administration at 12- to 24-hour interval. Elimination Cyclophosphamide is primarily excreted as metabolites. 10 to 20% is excreted unchanged in the urine and 4% is excreted in the bile following IV administration. Special Populations Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide were determined following one-hour intravenous infusion to renally impaired patients. The results demonstrated that the systemic exposure to cyclophosphamide increased as the renal function decreased. Mean dose-corrected AUC increased by 38% in the moderate renal group,(Creatinine clearance (CrCl of 25 to 50 mL/min), by 64% in the severe renal group (CrCl of 10 to 24 mL/min) and by 23% in the hemodialysis group (CrCl of <10 mL/min) compared to the control group. The increase in exposure was significant in the severe group (p>0.05); thus, patients with severe renal impairment should be closely monitored for toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . The dialyzability of cyclophosphamide was investigated in four patients on long-term hemodialysis. Dialysis clearance calculated by arterial-venous difference and actual drug recovery in dialysate averaged 104 mL/min, which is in the range of the metabolic clearance of 95 mL/min for the drug. A mean of 37% of the administered dose of cyclophosphamide was removed during hemodialysis. The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) was 3.3 hours in patients during hemodialysis, a 49% reduction of the 6.5 hours to t 1/2 reported in uremic patients. Reduction in t 1/2 , larger dialysis clearance than metabolic clearance, high extraction efficiency, and significant drug removal during dialysis, suggest that cyclophosphamide is dialyzable. Hepatic Impairment Total body clearance (CL) of cyclophosphamide is decreased by 40% in patients with severe hepatic impairment and elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) is prolonged by 64%. Mean CL and t 1/2 were 45 \u00b1 8.6 L/kg and 12.5 \u00b1 1.0 hours respectively, in patients with severe hepatic impairment and 63 \u00b1 7.6 L/kg and 7.6 \u00b1 1.4 hours respectively in the control group [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 )] ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Sandoz Inc."], "substance_name": ["CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE"], "effective_time": "20250305", "product_ndc": ["0781-3233", "0781-3244", "0781-3255"], "brand_name": ["Cyclophosphamide"]}

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 mg/hr to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type ll diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u00df-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u01b4-half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )]. The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."], "manufacturer_name": ["West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp"], "substance_name": ["NICARDIPINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20181212", "product_ndc": ["0143-9593"], "brand_name": ["Nicardipine Hydrochloride"]}

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro . Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following twice weekly administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 bortezomib doses, the maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (relative to baseline) in whole blood was observed five minutes after drug administration. Comparable maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was observed between 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses.

When administered twice weekly, the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m 2 dose to patients with multiple myeloma, the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC last ) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The AUC last geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) was 0.99 (0.80 to 1.23). The C max after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/mL) was lower than after intravenous administration (223 ng/mL) with repeat dose administration. Distribution The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 L/m 2 following single- or repeat-dose administration of 1 mg/m 2 or 1.3 mg/m 2 to patients with multiple myeloma. The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively.

Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported through the cell membrane by facilitative glucose transporter proteins and is phosphorylated within the cell to [ 18 F] FDG-6-phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase. Once phosphorylated it cannot exit until it is dephosphorylated by glucose-6-phosphatase. Therefore, within a given tissue or pathophysiological process, the retention and clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect a balance involving glucose transporter, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities. When allowance is made for the kinetic differences between glucose and Fludeoxyglucose F 18 transport and phosphorylation (expressed as the ''lumped constant'' ratio), Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is used to assess glucose metabolism. In comparison to background activity of the specific organ or tissue type, regions of decreased or absent uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect the decrease or absence of glucose metabolism. Regions of increased uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect greater than normal rates of glucose metabolism. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection is rapidly distributed to all organs of the body after intravenous administration. After background clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection, optimal PET imaging is generally achieved between 30 to 40 minutes after administration. In cancer, the cells are generally characterized by enhanced glucose metabolism partially due to (1) an increase in activity of glucose transporters, (2) an increased rate of phosphorylation activity, (3) a reduction of phosphatase activity or, (4) a dynamic alteration in the balance among all these processes. However, glucose metabolism of cancer as reflected by Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation shows considerable variability. Depending on tumor type, stage, and location, Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation may be increased, normal, or decreased. Also, inflammatory cells can have the same variability of uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18. In the heart, under normal aerobic conditions, the myocardium meets the bulk of its energy requirements by oxidizing free fatty acids. Most of the exogenous glucose taken up by the myocyte is converted into glycogen. However, under ischemic conditions, the oxidation of free fatty acids decreases, exogenous glucose becomes the preferred myocardial substrate, glycolysis is stimulated, and glucose taken up by the myocyte is metabolized immediately instead of being converted into glycogen. Under these conditions, phosphorylated Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulates in the myocyte and can be detected with PET imaging. In the brain, cells normally rely on aerobic metabolism. In epilepsy, the glucose metabolism varies. Generally, during a seizure, glucose metabolism increases. Interictally, the seizure focus tends to be hypometabolic. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution: In four healthy male volunteers, receiving an intravenous administration of 30 seconds in duration, the arterial blood level profile for Fludeoxyglucose F 18 decayed triexponentially. The effective half-life ranges of the three phases were 0.2-0.3 minutes, 10-13 minutes with a mean and standard deviation (STD) of 11.6 (\u00b1) 1.1 min, and 80-95 minutes with a mean and STD of 88 (\u00b1) 4 min. Plasma protein binding of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 has not been studied. Metabolism: Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported into cells and phosphorylated to [ 18 F]-FDG-6- phosphate at a rate proportional to the rate of glucose utilization within that tissue. [F 18]-FDG-6-phosphate presumably is metabolized to 2-deoxy-2-[F 18]fluoro-6-phospho-D-mannose([F 18]FDM-6-phosphate). Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection may contain several impurities (e.g., 2-deoxy-2-chloro-D-glucose (ClDG)). Biodistribution and metabolism of ClDG are presumed to be similar to Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and would be expected to result in intracellular formation of 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-glucose (ClDG-6-phosphate) and 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-mannose (ClDM-6-phosphate). The phosphorylated deoxyglucose compounds are dephosphorylated and the resulting compounds (FDG, FDM, ClDG, and ClDM) presumably leave cells by passive diffusion. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and related compounds are cleared from non-cardiac tissues within 3 to 24 hours after administration. Clearance from the cardiac tissue may require more than 96 hours. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 that is not involved in glucose metabolism in any tissue is then excreted in the urine. Elimination: Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is cleared from most tissues within 24 hours and can be eliminated from the body unchanged in the urine. Three elimination phases have been identified in the reviewed literature. Within 33 minutes, a mean of 3.9% of the administrated radioactive dose was measured in the urine. The amount of radiation exposure of the urinary bladder at two hours post-administration suggests that 20.6% (mean) of the radioactive dose was present in the bladder. Special Populations: The pharmacokinetics of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection have not been studied in renally-impaired, hepatically impaired or pediatric patients. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is eliminated through the renal system. Avoid excessive radiation exposure to this organ system and adjacent tissues. The effects of fasting, varying blood sugar levels, conditions of glucose intolerance, and diabetes mellitus on Fludeoxyglucose F 18 distribution in humans have not been ascertained [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]."], "manufacturer_name": ["MIPS Cyclotron & Radiochemistry Facility"], "substance_name": ["FLUDEOXYGLUCOSE F-18"], "effective_time": "20250114", "product_ndc": ["69587-001"], "brand_name": ["Fludeoxyglucose F18"]}

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action PEMRYDI RTU is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor that disrupts folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. In vitro studies show that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is taken into cells by membrane carriers such as the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pemetrexed inhibited the in vitro growth of mesothelioma cell lines (MSTO-211H, NCI-H2052) and showed synergistic effects when combined with cisplatin. Based on population pharmacodynamic analyses, the depth of the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) nadir correlates with the systemic exposure to pemetrexed and supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B 12 . There is no cumulative effect of pemetrexed exposure on ANC nadir over multiple treatment cycles. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed when PEMRYDI RTU was administered as a single agent in doses ranging from 0.2 to 838 mg/m 2 infused over a 10-minute period have been evaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumors. Pemetrexed total systemic exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C max ) increased proportionally with increase of dose. The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed did not change over multiple treatment cycles. Distribution Pemetrexed has a steady-state volume of distribution of 16.1 liters. In vitro studies indicated that pemetrexed is 81% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination The total systemic clearance of pemetrexed is 91.8 mL/min and the elimination half-life of pemetrexed is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90 mL/min). As renal function decreases, the clearance of pemetrexed decreases and exposure (AUC) of pemetrexed increases. Metabolism Pemetrexed is not metabolized to an appreciable extent. Excretion Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70% to 90% of the dose recovered unchanged within the first 24 hours following administration. In vitro studies indicated that pemetrexed is a substrate of OAT3 (organic anion transporter 3), a transporter that is involved in the active secretion of pemetrexed. Specific Populations Age (26 to 80 years) and sex had no clinically meaningful effect on the systemic exposure of pemetrexed based on population pharmacokinetic analyses. Racial Groups The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed were similar in Whites and Blacks or African Americans. Insufficient data are available for other ethnic groups. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Pemetrexed has not been formally studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No effect of elevated AST, ALT, or total bilirubin on the PK of pemetrexed was observed in clinical studies. Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic analyses of pemetrexed included 127 patients with impaired renal function. Plasma clearance of pemetrexed decreases as renal function decreases, with a resultant increase in systemic exposure. Patients with creatinine clearances of 45, 50, and 80 mL/min had 65%, 54%, and 13% increases, respectively in systemic exposure (AUC) compared to patients with creatinine clearance of 100 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] . Third-Space Fluid The pemetrexed plasma concentrations in patients with various solid tumors with stable, mild to moderate third-space fluid were comparable to those observed in patients without third space fluid collections. The effect of severe third space fluid on pharmacokinetics is not known. Drug Interaction Studies Drugs Inhibiting OAT3 Transporter Ibuprofen, an OAT3 inhibitor, administered at 400 mg four times a day decreased the clearance of pemetrexed and increased its exposure (AUC) by approximately 20% in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 mL/min). In Vitro Studies Pemetrexed is a substrate for OAT3. Ibuprofen, an OAT3 inhibitor inhibited the uptake of pemetrexed in OAT3-expressing cell cultures with an average [Iu]/IC 50 ratio of 0.38. In vitro data predict that at clinically relevant concentrations, other NSAIDs (naproxen, diclofenac, celecoxib) would not inhibit the uptake of pemetrexed by OAT3 and would not increase the AUC of pemetrexed to a clinically significant extent [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] . Pemetrexed is a substrate for OAT4. In vitro , ibuprofen and other NSAIDs (naproxen, diclofenac, celecoxib) are not inhibitors of OAT4 at clinically relevant concentrations. Aspirin Aspirin, administered in low to moderate doses (325 mg every 6 hours), does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. Cisplatin Cisplatin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed and the pharmacokinetics of total platinum are unaltered by pemetrexed. Vitamins Neither folic acid nor vitamin B 12 affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed.

It should not be used in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome or short PR syndrome. Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia Rapid conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) to sinus rhythm. This includes AV nodal reentrant tachycardias and reciprocating tachycardias associated with an extranodal accessory pathway such as the WPW syndrome or short PR syndrome. Unless otherwise contraindicated, appropriate vagal maneuvers should be attempted prior to administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection. The use of diltiazem hydrochloride injection should be undertaken with caution when the patient is compromised hemodynamically or is taking other drugs that decrease any or all of the following: peripheral resistance, myocardial filling, myocardial contractility, or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium. For either indication and particularly when employing continuous intravenous infusion, the setting should include continuous monitoring of the ECG and frequent measurement of blood pressure. A defibrillator and emergency equipment should be readily available.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanisms of Action Diltiazem inhibits the influx of calcium (Ca 2+ ) ions during membrane depolarization of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The therapeutic benefits of diltiazem in supraventricular tachycardias are related to its ability to slow AV nodal conduction time and prolong AV nodal refractoriness. Diltiazem exhibits frequency (use) dependent effects on AV nodal conduction such that it may selectively reduce the heart rate during tachycardias involving the AV node with little or no effect on normal AV nodal conduction at normal heart rates. Diltiazem slows the ventricular rate in patients with a rapid ventricular response during atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Diltiazem converts paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) to normal sinus rhythm by interrupting the reentry circuit in AV nodal reentrant tachycardias and reciprocating tachycardias, e.g., Wolff- Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). Diltiazem prolongs the sinus cycle length. It has no effect on the sinus node recovery time or on the sinoatrial conduction time in patients without SA nodal dysfunction. Diltiazem has no significant electrophysiologic effect on tissues in the heart that are fast sodium channel dependent, e.g., His-Purkinje tissue, atrial and ventricular muscle, and extranodal accessory pathways. Like other calcium channel antagonists, because of its effect on vascular smooth muscle, diltiazem decreases total peripheral resistance resulting in a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Hemodynamics In patients with cardiovascular disease, diltiazem hydrochloride administered intravenously in single bolus doses, followed in some cases by a continuous infusion, reduced blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance and increased coronary blood flow. In a limited number of studies of patients with compromised myocardium (severe congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), administration of intravenous diltiazem produced no significant effect on contractility, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The mean ejection fraction and cardiac output/index remained unchanged or increased. Maximal hemodynamic effects usually occurred within 2 to 5 minutes of an injection. However, in rare instances, worsening of congestive heart failure has been reported in patients with preexisting impaired ventricular function. Pharmacodynamics The prolongation of PR interval correlated significantly with plasma diltiazem concentration in normal volunteers using the Sigmoidal E max model. Changes in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure did not correlate with diltiazem plasma concentrations in normal volunteers. Reduction in mean arterial pressure correlated linearly with diltiazem plasma concentration in a group of hypertensive patients. In patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, a significant correlation was observed between the percent reduction in HR and plasma diltiazem concentration using the Sigmoidal E max model. Based on this relationship, the mean plasma diltiazem concentration required to produce a 20% decrease in heart rate was determined to be 80 ng/mL. Mean plasma diltiazem concentrations of 130 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL were determined to produce reductions in heart rate of 30% and 40%. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following a single intravenous injection in healthy male volunteers, diltiazem hydrochloride appears to obey linear pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 10.5 to 21 mg. The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 3.4 hours. The apparent volume of distribution of diltiazem is approximately 305 L. Diltiazem is extensively metabolized in the liver with a systemic clearance of approximately 65 L/h. After constant rate intravenous infusion to healthy male volunteers, diltiazem exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics over an infusion range of 4.8 to 13.2 mg/h for 24 hours. Over this infusion range, as the dose is increased, systemic clearance decreases from 64 to 48 L/h while the plasma elimination half-life increases from 4.1 to 4.9 hours. The apparent volume of distribution remains unchanged (360 to 391 L). In patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, diltiazem systemic clearance has been found to be decreased compared to healthy volunteers. In patients administered bolus doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 38.5 mg, systemic clearance averaged 36 L/h. In patients administered continuous infusions at 10 mg/h or 15 mg/h for 24 hours, diltiazem systemic clearance averaged 42 L/h and 31 L/h, respectively. Based on the results of pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers administered different oral diltiazem hydrochloride formulations, constant rate intravenous infusions of diltiazem hydrochloride at 3, 5, 7, and 11 mg/h are predicted to produce steady-state plasma diltiazem concentrations equivalent to 120-, 180-, 240-, and 360-mg total daily oral doses of diltiazem hydrochloride tablets and diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release capsules. After oral administration, diltiazem undergoes extensive metabolism in man by deacetylation, N-demethylation, and O-demethylation via cytochrome P-450 (oxidative metabolism) in addition to conjugation. Metabolites N-monodesmethyldiltiazem, desacetyldiltiazem, desacetyl-N-monodesmethyldiltiazem, desacetyl-O-desmethyldiltiazem, and desacetyl-N, O-desmethyldiltiazem have been identified in human urine. Following oral administration, 2% to 4% of the unchanged diltiazem appears in the urine. Drugs which induce or inhibit hepatic microsomal enzymes may alter diltiazem disposition. Following single intravenous injection of diltiazem hydrochloride, however, plasma concentrations of N-monodesmethyldiltiazem and desacetyldiltiazem, two principal metabolites found in plasma after oral administration, are typically not detected. These metabolites are observed, however, following 24 hour constant rate intravenous infusion. Total radioactivity measurement following short IV administration in healthy volunteers suggests the presence of other unidentified metabolites which attain higher concentrations than those of diltiazem and are more slowly eliminated; half-life of total radioactivity is about 20 hours compared to 2 to 5 hours for diltiazem. Diltiazem hydrochloride is 70% to 80% bound to plasma proteins. In vitro studies suggest alpha 1 -acid glycoprotein binds approximately 40% of the drug at clinically significant concentrations. Albumin appears to bind approximately 30% of the drug, while other constituents bind the remaining bound fraction. Competitive in vitro ligand binding studies have shown that diltiazem hydrochloride binding is not altered by therapeutic concentrations of digoxin, phenytoin, hydrochlorothiazide, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, propranolol, salicylic acid, tolbutamide, or warfarin. Renal insufficiency, or even end-stage renal disease, does not appear to influence diltiazem disposition following oral administration.

It also binds with high affinity to serotonin 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , and 5-HT 2C receptors, noradrenaline \u03b1 2A , \u03b1 2B and \u03b1 1 receptors, and dopamine D 2L and D 3 receptors. The therapeutic activity of dihydroergotamine in migraine is generally attributed to the agonist effect at 5-HT 1D receptors. Two current theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT 1D receptor agonists in migraine. One theory suggests that activation of 5-HT 1D receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on arteriovenous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache. The alternative hypothesis suggests that activation of 5-HT 1D receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. In addition, dihydroergotamine possesses oxytocic properties. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Absolute bioavailability for the subcutaneous and intramuscular route have not been determined; however, no difference was observed in dihydroergotamine bioavailability from intramuscular and subcutaneous doses. Dihydroergotamine mesylate is poorly bioavailable following oral administration. Distribution Dihydroergotamine mesylate is 93% plasma protein bound. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 800 liters. Metabolism Four dihydroergotamine mesylate metabolites have been identified in human plasma following oral administration. The major metabolite, 8\u2032-\u03b2-hydroxydihydroergotamine, exhibits affinity equivalent to its parent for adrenergic and 5-HT receptors and demonstrates equivalent potency in several venoconstrictor activity models, in vivo and in vitro. The other metabolites, (i.e., dihydrolysergic acid, dihydrolysergic amide) and a metabolite formed by oxidative opening of the proline ring are of minor importance. Following nasal administration, total metabolites represent only 20% to 30% of plasma AUC. Quantitative pharmacokinetic characterization of the four metabolites has not been performed. Excretion The major excretory route of dihydroergotamine is via the bile in the feces. The total body clearance is 1.5 L/min which reflects mainly hepatic clearance. Only 6% to 7% of unchanged dihydroergotamine is excreted in the urine after intramuscular injection. The renal clearance (0.1 L/min) is unaffected by the route of dihydroergotamine administration. The decline of plasma dihydroergotamine after intramuscular or intravenous administration is multi-exponential with a terminal half-life of about 9 hours. Subpopulations No studies have been conducted on the effect of renal or hepatic impairment, gender, race, or ethnicity on dihydroergotamine pharmacokinetics. Dihydroergotamine mesylate is contraindicated in patients with severely impaired hepatic or renal function (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Interactions Pharmacokinetic interactions have been reported in patients treated orally with other ergot alkaloids (e.g., increased levels of ergotamine) and macrolide antibiotics, principally troleandomycin, presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P4503A metabolism of the alkaloids by troleandomycin. Dihydroergotamine has also been shown to be an inhibitor of cytochrome P4503A catalyzed reactions and rare reports of ergotism have been obtained from patients treated with dihydroergotamine and macrolide antibiotics (e.g., troleandomycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), and in patients treated with dihydroergotamine and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P4503A metabolism of ergotamine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ).

Doxorubicin consists of a naphthacenequinone nucleus linked through a glycosidic bond at ring atom 7 to an amino sugar, daunosamine. Chemically, doxorubicin hydrochloride is (8S,10S)-10-[(3-Amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-a-L-lyxo-hexopyranosyl)-oxy]-8-glycoloyl-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro- 6,8,11-trihydroxy-1-methoxy-5,12-naphthacenedione hydrochloride. The structural formula is as follows: Doxorubicin binds to nucleic acids, presumably by specific intercalation of the planar anthracycline nucleus with the DNA double helix. The anthracycline ring is lipophilic, but the saturated end of the ring system contains abundant hydroxyl groups adjacent to the amino sugar, producing a hydrophilic center. The molecule is amphoteric, containing acidic functions in the ring phenolic groups and a basic function in the sugar amino group. It binds to cell membranes as well as plasma proteins.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin on malignant cells and its toxic effects on various organs are thought to be related to nucleotide base intercalation and cell membrane lipid binding activities of doxorubicin. Intercalation inhibits nucleotide replication and action of DNA and RNA polymerases. The interaction of doxorubicin with topoisomerase II to form DNA-cleavable complexes appears to be an important mechanism of doxorubicin cytocidal activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies conducted in patients with various types of tumors have shown that doxorubicin follows multiphasic disposition after intravenous injection. The distribution half-life is approximately 5 minutes, while the terminal half-life is 20 to 48 hours. In four patients, doxorubicin demonstrated dose-independent pharmacokinetics across a dose range of 30 to 70 mg/m 2 . Distribution Steady-state distribution volume ranges from 809 to 1214 L/m 2 . Binding of doxorubicin and its major metabolite, doxorubicinol, to plasma proteins is about 75% and is independent of plasma concentration of doxorubicin up to 1.1 mcg/mL. Doxorubicin was measured in the milk of one lactating patient after therapy with 70 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. The peak milk concentration at 24 hours after treatment was 4.4-fold greater than the corresponding plasma concentration. Doxorubicin was detectable in the milk up to 72 hours. Doxorubicin does not cross the blood brain barrier. Metabolism Enzymatic reduction at the 7 position and cleavage of the daunosamine sugar yields aglycones which are accompanied by free radical formation, the local production of which may contribute to the cardiotoxic activity of doxorubicin. Disposition of doxorubicinol in patients is formation rate limited, with the terminal half-life of doxorubicinol being similar to doxorubicin. The relative exposure of doxorubicinol, i.e., the ratio between the AUC of doxorubicinol and the AUC of doxorubicin is approximately 0.5. Excretion Plasma clearance is in the range 324 to 809 mL/min/m 2 and is predominately by metabolism and biliary excretion. Approximately 40% of the dose appears in the bile in 5 days, while only 5 to 12% of the drug and its metabolites appear in the urine during the same time period. In urine, <3% of the dose was recovered as doxorubicinol over 7 days. Systemic clearance of doxorubicin is significantly reduced in obese women with ideal body weight greater than 130%. There was a significant reduction in clearance without any change in volume of distribution in obese patients when compared with normal patients with less than 115% ideal body weight. Pediatric patients Following administration of doses ranging from 10 to 75 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin to 60 children and adolescents ranging from 2 months to 20 years of age, doxorubicin clearance averaged 1443 \u00b1 114 mL/min/m 2 . Further analysis demonstrated that clearance in 52 children greater than 2 years of age (1540 mL/min/m 2 ) was increased compared with adults. However, clearance in infants younger than 2 years of age (813 mL/min/m 2 ) was decreased compared with older children and approached the range of clearance values determined in adults [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 )] . Patient Gender There is no recommended dose adjustment based on gender. A published clinical study involving 6 men and 21 women with no prior anthracycline therapy reported a significantly higher median doxorubicin clearance in men compared to women (1088 mL/min/m 2 versus 433 mL/min/m 2 ). However, the terminal half-life of doxorubicin was longer in men compared to women (54 versus 35 hours).

Sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate are metabolically active compounds that can serve as alternatives to urea for the excretion of waste nitrogen. Figure 2 is a schematic illustrating how the components of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, phenylacetate and benzoate, provide an alternative pathway for nitrogen disposal in patients without a fully functioning urea cycle. Phenylacetate conjugates with glutamine in the liver and kidneys to form phenylacetylglutamine, via acetylation. Phenylacetylglutamine is excreted by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. The nitrogen content of phenylacetylglutamine per mole is identical to that of urea (both contain two moles of nitrogen). Two moles of nitrogen are removed per mole of phenylacetate when it is conjugated with glutamine. Similarly, preceded by acylation, benzoate conjugates with glycine to form hippuric acid, which is rapidly excreted by the kidneys by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. One mole of hippuric acid contains one mole of waste nitrogen. Thus, one mole of nitrogen is removed per mole of benzoate when it is conjugated with glycine. Figure 2 CPS = carbamyl phosphate synthetase; OTC = ornithine transcarbamylase; ASS = argininosuccinate synthetase; ASL = argininosuccinate lyase; ARG = arginase; NAGS = N -acetylglutamate synthetase 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with hyperammonemia due to deficiencies in enzymes of the urea cycle, Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection has been shown to decrease elevated plasma ammonia levels. These effects are considered to be the result of reduction in nitrogen overload through glutamine and glycine scavenging by Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection in combination with appropriate dietary and other supportive measures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection was characterized in healthy adult volunteers. Both benzoate and phenylacetate exhibited nonlinear kinetics. Following 90 minute intravenous infusion mean AUC last for benzoate was 20.3, 114.9, 564.6, 562.8, and 1599.1 mcg/mL following doses of 1, 2, 3.75, 4, and 5.5 g/m 2 , respectively. The total clearance decreased from 5.19 to 3.62 L/h/m 2 at the 3.75 and 5.5 g/m 2 doses, respectively. Similarly, phenylacetate exhibited nonlinear kinetics following the priming dose regimens. AUC last was 175.6, 713.8, 2040.6, 2181.6, and 3829.2 mcg\u22c5h/mL following doses of 1, 2, 3.75, 4, and 5.5 g/m 2 , respectively. The total clearance decreased from 1.82 to 0.89 mcg\u22c5h/mL with increasing dose (3.75 and 4 g/m 2 , respectively). During the sequence of 90 minute priming infusion followed by a 24 hour maintenance infusion, phenylacetate was detected in the plasma at the end of infusion (T max of 2 hr at 3.75 g/m 2 ) whereas, benzoate concentrations declined rapidly (T max of 1.5 hr at 3.75 g/m 2 ) and were undetectable at 14 and 26 hours following the 3.75 and 4 g/m 2 dose, respectively. A difference in the metabolic rates for phenylacetate and benzoate was noted. The formation of hippurate from benzoate occurred more rapidly than that of phenylacetylglutamine from phenylacetate, and the rate of elimination for hippurate appeared to be more rapid than that for phenylacetylglutamine. Pharmacokinetic observations have also been reported from twelve episodes of hyperammonemic encephalopathy in seven children diagnosed (age 3 to 26 months) with urea cycle disorders who had been administered Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection intravenously. These data showed peak plasma levels of phenylacetate and benzoate at approximately the same times as were observed in healthy adults. As in healthy adults, the plasma levels of phenylacetate were higher than benzoate and were present for a longer time. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous phenylacetate have been reported following administration to adult patients with advanced solid tumors. The decline in serum phenylacetate concentrations following a loading infusion of 150 mg/kg was consistent with saturable enzyme kinetics. Ninety-nine percent of administered phenylacetate was excreted as phenylacetylglutamine. moa-figure-02"], "manufacturer_name": ["Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc."], "substance_name": ["SODIUM BENZOATE", "SODIUM PHENYLACETATE"], "effective_time": "20231030", "product_ndc": ["70710-1926"], "brand_name": ["Sodium phenylacetate and Sodium benzoate"]}

The mean area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) for nafcillin in this study was 18.06 mcg\u2022h/mL. The serum half-life of nafcillin administered by the intravenous route ranged from 33 to 61 minutes as measured in three separate studies. In contrast to the other penicillinase-resistant penicillins, only about 30% of nafcillin is excreted as unchanged drug in the urine of normal volunteers, and most within the first six hours. Nafcillin is primarily eliminated by nonrenal routes, namely hepatic inactivation and excretion in the bile. Nafcillin binds to serum proteins, mainly albumin. The degree of protein binding reported for nafcillin is 89.9 \u00b1 1.5%. Reported values vary with the method of study and the investigator. The concurrent administration of probenecid with nafcillin increases and prolongs plasma concentrations of nafcillin. Probenecid significantly reduces the total body clearance of nafcillin with renal clearance being decreased to a greater extent than nonrenal clearance. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins are widely distributed in various body fluids, including bile, pleural, amniotic and synovial fluids. With normal doses insignificant concentrations are found in the aqueous humor of the eye. High nafcillin CSF levels have been obtained in the presence of inflamed meninges. Renal failure does not appreciably affect the serum half-life of nafcillin; therefore, no modification of the usual nafcillin dosage is necessary in renal failure with or without hemodialysis. Hemodialysis does not accelerate the rate of clearance of nafcillin from the blood. A study which assessed the effects of cirrhosis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction in man demonstrated that the plasma clearance of nafcillin was significantly decreased in patients with hepatic dysfunction. In these patients with cirrhosis and extrahepatic obstruction, nafcillin excretion in the urine was significantly increased from about 30 to 50% of the administered dose, suggesting that renal disease superimposed on hepatic disease could further decrease nafcillin clearance.

It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e) are generally dose- proportional over the dose range of 0.3 mcg/kg to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42\u00b134%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110\u00b145%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067\u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S\u2011hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5\u2011HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4. The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Co-administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron hydrochloride injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."], "manufacturer_name": ["Baxter Healthcare Corporation"], "substance_name": ["PALONOSETRON HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20200915", "product_ndc": ["36000-326"], "brand_name": ["Palonosetron Hydrochloride"]}

These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, exocrine glands and, to a limited degree, in the autonomic ganglia. Thus, it diminishes the volume and free acidity of gastric secretions and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal, and bronchial secretions. Glycopyrrolate antagonizes muscarinic symptoms (e.g., bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, and intestinal hypermotility) induced by cholinergic drugs such as the anticholinesterases. The highly polar quaternary ammonium group of glycopyrrolate limits its passage across lipid membranes, such as the blood-brain barrier, in contrast to atropine sulfate and scopolamine hydrobromide, which are highly non-polar tertiary amines which penetrate lipid barriers easily. With intravenous injection, the onset of action is generally evident within one minute. Following intramuscular administration, the onset of action is noted in 15 to 30 minutes, with peak effects occurring within approximately 30 to 45 minutes. The vagal blocking effects persist for 2 to 3 hours and the antisialagogue effects persist up to 7 hours, periods longer than for atropine. Pharmacokinetics The following pharmacokinetic information and conclusions were obtained from published studies that used nonspecific assay methods.

After IV administration of a 0.2 mg radiolabeled glycopyrrolate, 85% of dose recovered was recovered in urine 48 hours postdose and some of the radioactivity was also recovered in bile. After IM administration of glycopyrrolate to adults, the mean T 1/2 value is reported to be between 0.55 to 1.25 hrs.

Diastolic pressure falls. Renal blood flow is decreased in normotensive subjects but is increased markedly in shock. Systolic blood pressure may remain unchanged or rise, although mean arterial pressure typically falls. Cardiac output is increased because of the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of the drug in the face of diminished peripheral vascular resistance. Isoproterenol relaxes almost all varieties of smooth muscle when the tone is high, but this action is most pronounced on bronchial and gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It prevents or relieves bronchoconstriction, but tolerance to this effect develops with overuse of the drug. In man, isoproterenol causes less hyperglycemia than does epinephrine. Isoproterenol and epinephrine are equally effective in stimulating the release of free fatty acids and energy production. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Isoproterenol is readily absorbed when given parenterally or as an aerosol.

Relative to doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection doses at or below 20 mg/m 2 , the pharmacokinetics of total doxorubicin following a 50 mg/m 2 doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection dose are nonlinear. At this dose, the elimination half-life of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection is longer and the clearance lower compared to a 20 mg/m 2 dose. Distribution Direct measurement of liposomal doxorubicin shows that at least 90% of the drug (the assay used cannot quantify less than 5-10% free doxorubicin) remains liposome-encapsulated during circulation. In contrast to doxorubicin, which displays a large volume of distribution (range 700 to 1100 L/m 2 ), the small steady state volume of distribution of liposomal doxorubicin suggests that doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection is largely confined to vascular fluid.

Nelarabine is demethylated by ADA to ara-G, mono-phosphorylated by deoxyguanosine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase, and subsequently converted to the active 5\u2019-triphosphate, ara-GTP. Accumulation of ara-GTP in leukemic blasts allows for incorporation into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death. Other mechanisms may contribute to the cytotoxic and systemic toxicity of nelarabine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption : Following intravenous administration of nelarabine to adult patients with refractory leukemia or lymphoma, plasma ara-G C max values generally occurred at the end of the nelarabine infusion and were generally higher than nelarabine C max values, suggesting rapid and extensive conversion of nelarabine to ara-G. Mean plasma nelarabine and ara-G C max values were 5.0 \u00b1 3.0 mcg/mL and 31.4 \u00b1 5.6 mcg/mL, respectively, after a 1,500 mg/m 2 nelarabine dose infused over 2 hours in adult patients. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of ara-G is 37 times higher than that for nelarabine on Day 1 after nelarabine IV infusion of 1,500 mg/m 2 dose (162 \u00b1 49 mcg.h/mL versus 4.4 \u00b1 2.2 mcg.h/mL, respectively). Comparable C max and AUC values were obtained for nelarabine between Days 1 and 5 at the nelarabine adult dosage of 1,500 mg/m 2 , indicating that nelarabine does not accumulate after multiple-dosing. There are not enough ara-G data to make a comparison between Day 1 and Day 5. After a nelarabine adult dose of 1,500 mg/m 2 , intracellular C max for ara-GTP appeared within 3 to 25 hours on Day 1. Exposure (AUC) to intracellular ara-GTP was 532 times higher than that for nelarabine and 14 times higher than that for ara-G (2,339 \u00b1 2,628 mcg.h/mL versus 4.4 \u00b1 2.2 mcg.h/mL and 162 \u00b1 49 mcg.h/mL, respectively). Because the intracellular levels of ara-GTP were so prolonged, its elimination half-life could not be accurately estimated. Distribution : Nelarabine and ara-G are extensively distributed throughout the body. For nelarabine, V SS values were 197 \u00b1 216 L/m 2 in adult patients. For ara-G, V SS /F values were 50 \u00b1 24 L/m 2 in adult patients. Nelarabine and ara-G are not substantially bound to human plasma proteins (< 25%) in vitro , and binding is independent of nelarabine or ara-G concentrations up to 600 \u03bcM. Metabolism : The principal route of metabolism for nelarabine is O-demethylation by ADA to form ara-G, which undergoes hydrolysis to form guanine. In addition, some nelarabine is hydrolyzed to form methylguanine, which is O-demethylated to form guanine. Guanine is N-deaminated to form xanthine, which is further oxidized to yield uric acid. Excretion : Nelarabine and ara-G are partially eliminated by the kidneys. Mean urinary excretion of nelarabine and ara-G was 6.6 \u00b1 4.7% and 27 \u00b1 15% of the administered dose, respectively, in 28 adult patients over the 24 hours after nelarabine infusion on Day 1. Renal clearance averaged 24 \u00b1 23 L/h for nelarabine and 6.2 \u00b1 5.0 L/h for ara-G in 21 adult patients. Combined Phase I pharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 199 to 2900 mg/m 2 (n = 66 adult patients) indicate that the mean clearance (CL) of nelarabine is 197 \u00b1 189 L/h/m 2 on Day 1. The apparent clearance of ara-G (CL/F) is 10.5 \u00b1 4.5 L/h/m 2 on Day 1. Nelarabine and ara-G are rapidly eliminated from plasma with a mean half-life of 18 minutes and 3.2 hours, respectively, in adult patients. Pediatrics : No pharmacokinetic data are available in pediatric patients at the once-daily 650 mg/m 2 nelarabine dosage. Combined Phase I pharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 104 to 2900 mg/m 2 indicate that the mean clearance (CL) of nelarabine is about 30% higher in pediatric patients than in adult patients (259 \u00b1 409 L/h/m 2 versus 197 \u00b1 189 L/h/m 2 , respectively) (n = 66 adults, n = 22 pediatric patients) on Day 1. The apparent clearance of ara-G (CL/F) is comparable between the 2 groups (10.5 \u00b1 4.5 L/h/m 2 in adult patients and 11.3 \u00b1 4.2 L/h/m 2 in pediatric patients) on Day 1. Nelarabine and ara-G are extensively distributed throughout the body. For nelarabine, V SS values were 213 \u00b1 358 L/m 2 in pediatric patients. For ara-G, V SS /F values were 33 \u00b1 9.3 L/m 2 in pediatric patients. Nelarabine and ara-G are rapidly eliminated from plasma in pediatric patients, with a half-life of 13 minutes and 2 hours, respectively. Effect of Age : Age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine or ara-G in adults. Decreased renal function, which is more common in the elderly, may reduce ara-G clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Effect of Gender : Gender has no effect on nelarabine or ara-G pharmacokinetics. Effect of Race : In general, nelarabine mean clearance and volume of distribution values tend to be higher in whites (n = 63) than in blacks (by about 10%) (n = 15). The opposite is true for ara-G; mean apparent clearance and volume of distribution values tend to be lower in whites than in blacks (by about 15% to 20%). No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these groups. Effect of Renal Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of nelarabine and ara-G have not been specifically studied in renally impaired or hemodialyzed patients. Nelarabine is excreted by the kidney to a small extent (5% to 10% of the administered dose). Ara-G is excreted by the kidney to a greater extent (20% to 30% of the administered nelarabine dose). In the combined Phase I trials, patients were categorized into 3 groups: normal with CLCr greater than 80 mL/min (n = 67), mild with CLCr = 50 to 80 mL/min (n = 15), and moderate with CLCr less than 50 mL/min (n = 3). The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of ara-G was about 15% and 40% lower in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively, than in patients with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed. Effect of Hepatic Impairment : The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine has not been evaluated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . Drug Interactions : Cytochrome P450 : Nelarabine and ara-G did not significantly inhibit the activities of the human hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 in vitro at concentrations of nelarabine and ara-G up to 100 \u03bcM. Fludarabine : Administration of fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 as a 30-minute infusion 4 hours before a 1200-mg/m 2 infusion of nelarabine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine, ara-G, or ara-GTP in 12 patients with refractory leukemia. Pentostatin : There is in vitro evidence that pentostatin is a strong inhibitor of ADA. Inhibition of ADA may result in a reduction in the conversion of the prodrug nelarabine to its active moiety and consequently in a reduction in efficacy of nelarabine and/or change in adverse reaction profile of either drug [see Drug Interactions (7)] ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Sandoz Inc"], "substance_name": ["NELARABINE"], "effective_time": "20250331", "product_ndc": ["66758-165"], "brand_name": ["Arranon"]}

In cells, sirolimus binds to the immunophilin, FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to generate an immunosuppressive complex.

Inhibition of mTOR by sirolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and in vivo studies. In a nonclinical study in athymic mice bearing human tumor xenografts, intravenous administration of FYARRO resulted in higher tumor accumulation of sirolimus, inhibition of an mTOR target in the tumor, and tumor growth inhibition compared to administration of an oral formulation of sirolimus at the same weekly total dose. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sirolimus exposure-response relationship has not been fully characterized.

Succinylcholine-Chloride-SPL-Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes. The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O2/narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including cardiac arrest. Changes in rhythm, including cardiac arrest, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from hyperkalemia, particularly in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4, 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics. Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase, and increases which may persist after onset of complete paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Succinylcholine may cause increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the fasciculation phase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ]. As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine-mediated release such as flushing, hypotension and bronchoconstriction are, however, uncommon with normal clinical usage. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold or cerebration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 mcg/mL after 2.5 minutes of an intravenous bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in 14 anesthetized patients. Metabolism Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline. Excretion About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient, the effective dose of succinylcholine chloride injection in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics RYR1 and CACNA1S are polymorphic genes and multiple pathogenic variants have been associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) in patients receiving succinylcholine, including succinylcholine chloride injection.

Milrinone lactate is designated chemically as 1,6-dihydro-2-methyl-6-oxo-[3,4'-bipyridine]-5-carbonitrile lactate and has the following structure: Milrinone is an off-white to tan crystalline compound with a molecular weight of 211.2 and an empirical formula of C 12 H 9 N 3 O. It is slightly soluble in methanol, and very slightly soluble in chloroform and in water. As the lactate salt, it is stable and colorless to pale yellow in solution. Milrinone lactate is available as sterile aqueous solutions of the lactate salt of milrinone for injection or infusion intravenously. Sterile, single-dose vials: Single-dose vials of 10 and 20 mL contain in each mL milrinone lactate equivalent to 1 mg milrinone and 47 mg Dextrose, Anhydrous, USP, in Water for Injection, USP. The pH is adjusted to between 3.2 and 4.0 with lactic acid or sodium hydroxide. The total concentration of lactic acid can vary between 0.95 mg/mL and 1.29 mg/mL. These vials require preparation of dilutions prior to administration to patients intravenously. structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Milrinone lactate is a positive inotrope and vasodilator, with little chronotropic activity different in structure and mode of action from either the digitalis glycosides or catecholamines. Milrinone lactate, at relevant inotropic and vasorelaxant concentrations, is a selective inhibitor of peak III cAMP phosphodiesterase isozyme in cardiac and vascular muscle. This inhibitory action is consistent with cAMP mediated increases in intracellular ionized calcium and contractile force in cardiac muscle, as well as with cAMP dependent contractile protein phosphorylation and relaxation in vascular muscle. Additional experimental evidence also indicates that milrinone lactate is not a beta-adrenergic agonist nor does it inhibit sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase activity as do the digitalis glycosides. Clinical studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that milrinone lactate produces dose-related and plasma drug concentration-related increases in the maximum rate of increase of left ventricular pressure. Studies in normal subjects have shown that milrinone lactate produces increases in the slope of the left ventricular pressure-dimension relationship, indicating a direct inotropic effect of the drug. Milrinone lactate also produces dose-related and plasma concentration-related increases in forearm blood flow in patients with congestive heart failure, indicating a direct arterial vasodilator activity of the drug. Both the inotropic and vasodilatory effects have been observed over the therapeutic range of plasma milrinone concentrations of 100 ng/mL to 300 ng/mL. In addition to increasing myocardial contractility, milrinone lactate improves diastolic function as evidenced by improvements in left ventricular diastolic relaxation. The acute administration of intravenous milrinone has also been evaluated in clinical trials in excess of 1600 patients, with chronic heart failure, heart failure associated with cardiac surgery, and heart failure associated with myocardial infarction. The total number of deaths, either on therapy or shortly thereafter (24 hours) was 15, less than 0.9%, few of which were thought to be drug-related. PHARMACOKINETICS Following intravenous injections of 12.5 mcg/kg to 125 mcg/kg to congestive heart failure patients, milrinone lactate had a volume of distribution of 0.38 liters/kg, a mean terminal elimination half-life of 2.3 hours, and a clearance of 0.13 liters/kg/hr. Following intravenous infusions of 0.2 mcg/kg/min to 0.7 mcg/kg/min to congestive heart failure patients, the drug had a volume of distribution of about 0.45 liters/kg, a mean terminal elimination half-life of 2.4 hours, and a clearance of 0.14 liters/kg/hr. These pharmacokinetic parameters were not dose-dependent, and the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve following injections was significantly dose-dependent. Milrinone lactate has been shown (by equilibrium dialysis) to be approximately 70% bound to human plasma protein. The primary route of excretion of milrinone lactate in man is via the urine. The major urinary excretions of orally administered milrinone lactate in man are milrinone (83%) and its 0-glucuronide metabolite (12%). Elimination in normal subjects via the urine is rapid, with approximately 60% recovered within the first two hours following dosing and approximately 90% recovered within the first eight hours following dosing. The mean renal clearance of milrinone lactate is approximately 0.3 liters/min, indicative of active secretion. Pharmacodynamics In patients with heart failure due to depressed myocardial function, milrinone lactate produced a prompt dose and plasma concentration related increase in cardiac output and decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and vascular resistance, which were accompanied by mild-to-moderate increases in heart rate. Additionally, there is no increased effect on myocardial oxygen consumption. In uncontrolled studies, hemodynamic improvement during intravenous therapy with milrinone lactate was accompanied by clinical symptomatic improvement, but the ability of milrinone lactate to relieve symptoms has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. The great majority of patients experience improvements in hemodynamic function within 5 to 15 minutes of the initiation of therapy. In studies in congestive heart failure patients, milrinone lactate when administered as a loading injection followed by a maintenance infusion produced significant mean initial increases in cardiac index of 25 percent, 38 percent, and 42 percent at dose regimens of 37.5 mcg/kg/0.375 mcg/kg/min, 50 mcg/kg/0.5 mcg/kg/min, and 75 mcg/kg/0.75 mcg/kg/min, respectively. Over the same range of loading injections and maintenance infusions, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure significantly decreased by 20 percent, 23 percent, and 36 percent, respectively, while systemic vascular resistance significantly decreased by 17 percent, 21 percent, and 37 percent. Mean arterial pressure fell by up to 5 percent at the two lower dose regimens, but by 17 percent at the highest dose. Patients evaluated for 48 hours maintained improvements in hemodynamic function, with no evidence of diminished response (tachyphylaxis). A smaller number of patients have received infusions of milrinone lactate for periods up to 72 hours without evidence of tachyphylaxis. The duration of therapy should depend upon patient responsiveness. Milrinone lactate has a favorable inotropic effect in fully digitalized patients without causing signs of glycoside toxicity. Theoretically, in cases of atrial flutter/fibrillation, it is possible that milrinone lactate may increase ventricular response rate because of its slight enhancement of AV node conduction. In these cases, digitalis should be considered prior to the institution of therapy with milrinone lactate. Improvement in left ventricular function in patients with ischemic heart disease has been observed. The improvement has occurred without inducing symptoms or electrocardiographic signs of myocardial ischemia. The steady-state plasma milrinone concentrations after approximately 6 to 12 hours of unchanging maintenance infusion of 0.5 mcg/kg/min are approximately 200 ng/mL. Near maximum favorable effects of milrinone lactate on cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are seen at plasma milrinone concentrations in the 150 ng/mL to 250 ng/mL range."], "manufacturer_name": ["Shandong New Time Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd."], "substance_name": ["MILRINONE LACTATE"], "effective_time": "20241126", "product_ndc": ["42677-313", "42677-314"], "brand_name": ["Milrinone Lactate"]}

Cardiac Electrophysiology The QTcF interval prolongation risk of XENLETA was evaluated using 2 randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily), parallel group, trials (Trials 1 and 2) in adult patients with CABP. A concentration dependent QTc prolongation effect of XENLETA was observed. The mean change from baseline QTcF (90% two-sided upper confidence interval) values around T max on day 3 or 4 were 13.6 ms (15.5 ms) for 150 mg injection administered twice daily as infusion and 9.3 ms (10.9 ms) for 600 mg tablet administered twice daily. The mean change from baseline QTcF (90% two-sided upper confidence interval) values around T max for the moxifloxacin randomized comparison arm on day 3 or 4 were 16.4 ms (18.3 ms) for 400 mg injection administered once daily as infusion and 11.6 ms (13.2 ms) for 400 mg tablet administered once daily. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following single-dose intravenous administration, the AUC of lefamulin increased approximately dose-proportionally while the C max of lefamulin increased less than dose-proportionally over a dose range of 25 mg (0.17 times the approved dose) to 400 mg (2.67 times the approved dose). Following single-dose oral administration, the AUC of lefamulin increased more than dose proportionally over a dose range of 500 mg (0.8 times the approved dose) to 750 mg (1.25 times the approved dose). Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of lefamulin following administration of XENLETA Injection or Tablets to patients with CABP are listed in Table 4 . The mean lefamulin AUC 0-24h and C max in patients with CABP were 73% and 30% higher, respectively, compared with healthy subjects.

Effect of Food The concomitant administration of a single oral dose of 600 mg XENLETA Tablets with a high fat (approximately 50% of total calories from fat), high calorie breakfast (approximately 800-1000 calories) slightly reduced bioavailability. The mean relative reduction for oral XENLETA (fasted vs. fed) was on average 22.9% [90% CI: 12.2; 32.3] for the C max and 18.43% [90% CI: 11.7; 24.7] for the AUC 0-inf . Distribution Mean plasma protein binding of lefamulin ranges from 94.8% at 2.35 mcg/mL to 97.1% at 0.25 mcg/mL in healthy adults. The mean (min to max) steady state volume of distribution of lefamulin is 86.1 L (34.2 to 153 L) in patients with CABP after administration of XENLETA Injection. Following a single IV administration of lefamulin 150 mg to healthy subjects, the highest lefamulin epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentrations were observed at the end of infusion. The mean ELF and plasma AUC 0-8 was 3.87 mcg\u00b7h/mL and 5.27 mcg\u00b7h/mL, respectively. The estimated ratio of ELF AUC to unbound plasma AUC is approximately 15. Elimination The mean (min to max) total body clearance of lefamulin is 11.9 L/h (2.94 to 30.0 L/h) in patients with CABP after XENLETA Injection administration. The mean (min to max) elimination half-life of lefamulin is approximately 8 hours (3 to 20 h) in patients with CABP. Metabolism Lefamulin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Excretion In healthy adult subjects, the mean % of total radioactivity excreted in feces was 77.3% (4.2% to 9.1% unchanged) and 88.5% (7.8% to 24.8% unchanged), and in urine was 15.5% (9.6% to 14.1% unchanged) and 5.3% (unchanged not determined) following 150 mg IV or 600 mg oral XENLETA, respectively. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of XENLETA were observed based on age, sex, race, weight, or renal impairment including patients receiving hemodialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The disposition of lefamulin was evaluated in non-infected subjects with normal hepatic function and with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment following administration of XENLETA Injection. The half-life of lefamulin is prolonged in subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared to that in subjects with normal hepatic function (17.5 h versus 11.5 h). Protein binding of lefamulin is reduced in subjects with hepatic impairment. Therefore, unbound (biologically active) lefamulin concentrations increased with the degree of hepatic impairment. On average, unbound lefamulin plasma AUC 0-inf was increased 3-fold in subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared to that in subjects with normal hepatic function. There is no information to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of lefamulin following administration of XENLETA Tablets. Thus, XENLETA Tablets are not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Lefamulin Strong CYP3A inducers or P-gp inducers: oral rifampin (strong inducer) reduced the mean lefamulin AUC 0-inf and C max by 28% and 8%, respectively, when administered concomitantly with XENLETA Injection. Additionally, oral rifampin reduced the mean lefamulin AUC 0-inf and C max by 72% and 57%, respectively, when administered concomitantly with XENLETA Tablets. Strong CYP3A inhibitors or P-gp inhibitors: oral ketoconazole (strong inhibitor) increased the mean lefamulin AUC 0-inf and C max by 31% and 6%, respectively, when administered concomitantly with XENLETA Injection. Additionally, oral ketoconazole (strong inhibitor) increased the lefamulin AUC 0-inf and C max by 165% and 58%, respectively, when administered concomitantly with XENLETA tablets. Effect of Lefamulin on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam were observed when administered concomitantly with XENLETA Injection. Mean AUC 0-inf and C max of midazolam were increased by approximately 200% and 100%, respectively, when oral midazolam (CYP3A substrate) was administered concomitantly with and at 2 or 4 hours after administration of XENLETA Tablets. P-gp substrates: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (P-gp substrate) were observed when administered concomitantly with XENLETA Tablets. In Vitro Studies Where Drug Interaction Potential Was Not Further Evaluated Clinically Lefamulin inhibited CYP2C8 (IC 50 =37.0 mcg/mL), BCRP (Breast Cancer Resistance Protein) (IC 50 =21.4 mcg/mL), and MATE1 (IC 50 =0.15 mcg/mL). 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action XENLETA is a systemic pleuromutilin antibacterial. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis through interactions (hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and Van der Waals forces) with the A- and P-sites of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) in domain V of the 23s rRNA of the 50S subunit. The binding pocket of the bacterial ribosome closes around the mutilin core for an induced fit that prevents correct positioning of tRNA. XENLETA is bactericidal in vitro against S. pneumoniae , H. influenzae and M. pneumoniae (including macrolide-resistant strains), and bacteriostatic against S. aureus and S. pyogenes at clinically relevant concentrations. XENLETA is not active against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Resistance The resistance frequency to XENLETA due to spontaneous mutations in vitro at 2-8 times the MIC was 2 x 10 -9 to <2 x 10 -11 for S. aureus , <1 x 10 -9 to <3 x 10 -10 for S. pneumoniae , and <4 x 10 -9 to <2 x 10 -10 for S. pyogenes . Resistance development at sub-MIC concentrations required greater than 1 mutational step with no resistant clones detected at \u22654-times MIC. Resistance mechanisms that affect XENLETA include specific protection or modification of the ribosomal target by ABC-F proteins such as vga (A, B, E), lsa (E), sal (A), Cfr methyl transferase, or by mutations of ribosomal proteins L3 and L4. Cfr methyl transferase has the potential to mediate cross-resistance between lefamulin and phenicols, lincosamides, oxazolidinones, and streptogramin A antibacterials. Some isolates resistant to \u03b2-lactams, glycopeptides, macrolides, mupirocin, quinolones, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be susceptible to XENLETA. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro studies demonstrated no antagonism between XENLETA and other antibacterial drugs (e.g., amikacin, azithromycin, aztreonam, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, linezolid, meropenem, penicillin, tigecycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin). XENLETA has demonstrated synergy in vitro with doxycycline against S. aureus . Antimicrobial Activity XENLETA has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1.1 )] : Gram-positive Bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates) Gram-negative Bacteria Haemophilus influenzae Other Bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydophila pneumoniae Legionella pneumophila At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoints for XENLETA against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the safety and efficacy of XENLETA in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Arsenic trioxide causes morphological changes and DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in NB4 human promyelocytic leukemia cells in vitro. Arsenic trioxide also causes damage or degradation of the fusion protein promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-alpha. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a single-arm trial of TRISENOX (0.15 mg/kg daily), 16 of 40 patients (40%) had a QTc interval greater than 500 msec. Prolongation of the QTc was observed between 1 and 5 weeks after TRISENOX infusion, and then returned towards baseline by the end of 8 weeks after TRISENOX infusion. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The inorganic, lyophilized form of arsenic trioxide, when placed into solution, immediately forms the hydrolysis product arsenious acid (As III ). As III is the pharmacologically active species of arsenic trioxide. Monomethylarsonic acid (MMA V ), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA V ) are the main pentavalent metabolites formed during metabolism, in addition to arsenic acid (As V ) a product of As III oxidation. The pharmacokinetics of arsenical species ([As III ], [As V ], [MMA V ], [DMA V ]) were determined in 6 APL patients following once-daily doses of 0.15 mg/kg for 5 days per week. Over the total single-dose range of 7 to 32 mg (administered as 0.15 mg/kg), systemic exposure (AUC) appears to be linear. Peak plasma concentrations of arsenious acid (As III ), the primary active arsenical species were reached at the end of infusion (2 hours). Plasma concentration of As III declined in a biphasic manner with a mean elimination half-life of 10 to 14 hours and is characterized by an initial rapid distribution phase followed by a slower terminal elimination phase. The daily exposure to As III (mean AUC 0-24h ) was 194 ng\u00b7hr/mL (n=5) on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 332 ng\u00b7hr/mL (n=6) on Day 25 of Cycle 1, which represents an approximate 2-fold accumulation. The primary pentavalent metabolites, MMA V and DMA V , are slow to appear in plasma (approximately 10 to 24 hours after first administration of arsenic trioxide), but, due to their longer half-life, accumulate more upon multiple dosing than does As III . The mean estimated terminal elimination half-lives of the metabolites MMA V and DMA V are 32 hours and 72 hours, respectively. Approximate accumulation ranged from 1.4- to 8-fold following multiple dosing as compared to single-dose administration. As V is present in plasma only at relatively low levels. Distribution The volume of distribution (V ss ) for As III is large (mean 562 L, N=10) indicating that As III is widely distributed throughout body tissues. V ss is also dependent on body weight and increases as body weight increases. Elimination Metabolism Much of the As III is distributed to the tissues where it is methylated to the less cytotoxic metabolites, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA V ) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA V ) by methyltransferases primarily in the liver. The metabolism of arsenic trioxide also involves oxidation of As III to As V , which may occur in numerous tissues via enzymatic or nonenzymatic processes. As V is present in plasma only at relatively low levels following administration of arsenic trioxide. Excretion Approximately 15% of the administered TRISENOX dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged As III . The methylated metabolites of As III (MMA V , DMA V ) are primarily excreted in the urine. The total clearance of As III is 49 L/h and the renal clearance is 9 L/h. Clearance is not dependent on body weight or dose administered over the range of 7 to 32 mg. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of As III , As V , and the pentavalent metabolites MMA V and DMA V was evaluated in 20 patients with advanced malignancies. Patients were classified as having normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CLcr] > 80 mL/min, n=6), mild renal impairment (CLcr 50 to 80 mL/min, n=5), moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 49 mL/min, n=6), or severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min, n=3). Following twice-weekly administration of 0.15 mg/kg over a 2-hour infusion, the mean AUC 0-INF for As III was comparable among the normal, mild and moderate renal impairment groups. However, in the severe renal impairment group, the mean AUC 0-INF for As III was approximately 48% higher than that in the normal group. Systemic exposure to MMA V and DMA V tended to be larger in patients with renal impairment; however, the clinical consequences of this increased exposure are not known. As V plasma levels were generally below the limit of assay quantitation in patients with impaired renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . The use of arsenic trioxide in patients on dialysis has not been studied. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of pharmacokinetics of As III , As V , and the pentavalent metabolites MMA V and DMA V was evaluated following administration of 0.25 to 0.50 mg/kg of arsenic trioxide in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients were classified as having normal hepatic function (n=4), mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, n=12), moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B, n=3), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C, n=1). No clear trend toward an increase in systemic exposure to As III , As V , MMA V or DMA V was observed with decreasing level of hepatic function as assessed by dose-normalized (per mg dose) AUC in the mild and moderate hepatic impairment groups. However, the one patient with severe hepatic impairment had mean dose-normalized AUC 0\u201124h and C max values 40% and 70% higher, respectively, than those patients with normal hepatic function.

Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol induces anesthesia, with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation). As with other rapidly acting intravenous anesthetic agents, the half-time of the blood-brain equilibration is approximately 1 to 3 minutes, accounting for the rate of induction of anesthesia. 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action, like all general anesthetics, is poorly understood. However, propofol is thought to produce its sedative/anesthetic effects by the positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter GABA through the ligand-gated GABA A receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamic properties of propofol are dependent upon the therapeutic blood propofol concentrations. Steady-state propofol blood concentrations are generally proportional to infusion rates. Undesirable side effects, such as cardiorespiratory depression, are likely to occur at higher blood concentrations which result from bolus dosing or rapid increases in infusion rates. An adequate interval (3 to 5 minutes) must be allowed between dose adjustments in order to assess clinical effects. The hemodynamic effects of propofol injectable emulsion during induction of anesthesia vary. If spontaneous ventilation is maintained, the major cardiovascular effect is arterial hypotension (sometimes greater than a 30% decrease) with little or no change in heart rate and no appreciable decrease in cardiac output. If ventilation is assisted or controlled (positive pressure ventilation), there is an increase in the incidence and the degree of depression of cardiac output. Addition of an opioid, used as a premedicant, further decreases cardiac output and respiratory drive. If anesthesia is continued by infusion of propofol injectable emulsion, the stimulation of endotracheal intubation and surgery may return arterial pressure towards normal. However, cardiac output may remain depressed. Comparative clinical studies have shown that the hemodynamic effects of propofol injectable emulsion during induction of anesthesia are generally more pronounced than with other intravenous induction agents. Induction of anesthesia with propofol injectable emulsion is frequently associated with apnea in both adults and pediatric patients. In adult patients who received propofol injectable emulsion (2 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg), apnea lasted less than 30 seconds in 7% of patients, 30 seconds to 60 seconds in 24% of patients, and more than 60 seconds in 12% of patients. In pediatric patients from birth through 16 years of age assessable for apnea who received bolus doses of propofol injectable emulsion (1 mg/kg to 3.6 mg/kg), apnea lasted less than 30 seconds in 12% of patients, 30 seconds to 60 seconds in 10% of patients, and more than 60 seconds in 5% of patients. During maintenance of general anesthesia, propofol injectable emulsion causes a decrease in spontaneous minute ventilation usually associated with an increase in carbon dioxide tension which may be marked depending upon the rate of administration and concurrent use of other medications (e.g., opioids, sedatives, etc.). During monitored anesthesia care (MAC) sedation, attention must be given to the cardiorespiratory effects of propofol injectable emulsion. Hypotension, oxyhemoglobin desaturation, apnea, and airway obstruction can occur, especially following a rapid bolus of propofol injectable emulsion. During initiation of MAC sedation, slow infusion or slow injection techniques are preferable over rapid bolus administration. During maintenance of MAC sedation, a variable rate infusion is preferable over intermittent bolus administration in order to minimize undesirable cardiorespiratory effects. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] . Clinical and preclinical studies suggest that propofol injectable emulsion is rarely associated with elevation of plasma histamine levels. Preliminary findings in patients with normal intraocular pressure indicate that propofol injectable emulsion produces a decrease in intraocular pressure which may be associated with a concomitant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Clinical studies indicate that propofol injectable emulsion when used in combination with hypocarbia increases cerebrovascular resistance and decreases cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic oxygen consumption, and intracranial pressure. Propofol injectable emulsion does not affect cerebrovascular reactivity to changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Clinical studies indicate that propofol injectable emulsion does not suppress the adrenal response to ACTH. Animal studies and limited experience in susceptible patients have not indicated any propensity of propofol injectable emulsion to induce malignant hyperthermia. Hemosiderin deposits have been observed in the livers of dogs receiving propofol injectable emulsion containing 0.005% disodium edetate over a four-week period; the clinical significance of this is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of propofol are well described by a three- compartment linear model with compartments representing the plasma, rapidly equilibrating tissues, and slowly equilibrating tissues. Following an intravenous bolus dose, there is rapid equilibration between the plasma and the brain, accounting for the rapid onset of anesthesia. Plasma levels initially decline rapidly as a result of both distribution and metabolic clearance. Distribution accounts for about half of this decline following a bolus of propofol. However, distribution is not constant over time, but decreases as body tissues equilibrate with plasma and become saturated. The rate at which equilibration occurs is a function of the rate and duration of the infusion. When equilibration occurs there is no longer a net transfer of propofol between tissues and plasma. Discontinuation of the recommended doses of propofol injectable emulsion after the maintenance of anesthesia for approximately one hour, or for sedation in the ICU for one day, results in a prompt decrease in blood propofol concentrations and rapid awakening. Longer infusions (10 days of ICU sedation) result in accumulation of significant tissue stores of propofol, such that the reduction in circulating propofol is slowed and the time to awakening is increased. By daily titration of propofol injectable emulsion dosage to achieve only the minimum effective therapeutic concentration, rapid awakening within 10 to 15 minutes can occur even after long-term administration. If, however, higher than necessary infusion levels have been maintained for a long time, propofol redistribution from fat and muscle to the plasma can be significant and slow recovery. The figure below illustrates the fall of plasma propofol levels following infusions of various durations to provide ICU sedation. The large contribution of distribution (about 50%) to the fall of propofol plasma levels following brief infusions means that after very long infusions a reduction in the infusion rate is appropriate by as much as half the initial infusion rate in order to maintain a constant plasma level. Therefore, failure to reduce the infusion rate in patients receiving propofol injectable emulsion for extended periods may result in excessively high blood concentrations of the drug. Thus, titration to clinical response and daily evaluation of sedation levels are important during use of propofol injectable emulsion infusion for ICU sedation. Adults Propofol clearance ranges from 23 mL/kg/min to 50 mL/kg/min (1.6 L/min to 3.4 L/min in 70 kg adults). It is chiefly eliminated by hepatic conjugation to inactive metabolites which are excreted by the kidney. A glucuronide conjugate accounts for about 50% of the administered dose. Propofol has a steady-state volume of distribution (10-day infusion) approaching 60 L/kg in healthy adults. A difference in pharmacokinetics due to gender has not been observed. The terminal half-life of propofol after a 10-day infusion is 1 day to 3 days. Geriatrics With increasing patient age, the dose of propofol needed to achieve a defined anesthetic end point (dose-requirement) decreases. This does not appear to be an age-related change in pharmacodynamics or brain sensitivity, as measured by EEG burst suppression. With increasing patient age, pharmacokinetic changes are such that, for a given intravenous bolus dose, higher peak plasma concentrations occur, which can explain the decreased dose requirement. These higher peak plasma concentrations in the elderly can predispose patients to cardiorespiratory effects including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or arterial oxygen desaturation. The higher plasma levels reflect an age-related decrease in volume of distribution and intercompartmental clearance. Lower doses are therefore recommended for initiation and maintenance of sedation and anesthesia in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Pediatrics The pharmacokinetics of propofol were studied in children between 3 years and 12 years of age who received propofol injectable emulsion for periods of approximately 1 to 2 hours. The observed distribution and clearance of propofol in these children were similar to adults. Organ Failure The pharmacokinetics of propofol do not appear to be different in people with chronic hepatic cirrhosis or chronic renal impairment compared to adults with normal hepatic and renal function. The effects of acute hepatic or renal failure on the pharmacokinetics of propofol have not been studied [ See Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and ( 8.7 )] .

The principal therapeutic action of morphine is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Morphine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Morphine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Morphine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Morphine produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids The minimum effective analgesic concentration of morphine for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) ]. Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing morphine plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.4 ) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The minimum analgesic morphine plasma concentration during Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) has been reported as 20-40 ng/mL, corresponding to a self-administration rate of 1.5 to 3 mg/h. Distribution Morphine has an apparent volume of distribution ranging from 1 to 4.7 L/kg after intravenous dosage. Protein binding is low, about 36%, and muscle tissue binding is reported as 54%. When morphine is introduced outside of the CNS, plasma concentrations of morphine remain higher than the corresponding CSF morphine levels. Elimination Morphine has a total plasma clearance which ranges from 0.9 to 1.2 L/kg/h (liters/kilogram/hour) in postoperative patients, but shows considerable inter individual variation. Metabolism The major pathway of clearance is hepatic glucuronidation to morphine-3-glucuronide, which is pharmacologically inactive. Excretion The major excretion path of the conjugate is through the kidneys, with about 10% in the feces. Morphine is also eliminated by the kidneys, 2 to 12% being excreted unchanged in the urine. Terminal half-life is commonly reported to vary from 1.5 to 4.5 hours, although the longer half-lives were obtained when morphine levels were monitored over protracted periods with very sensitive radioimmunoassay methods. The accepted elimination half-life in normal subjects is 1.5 to 2 hours. Specific Populations Sex While evidence of greater post-operative Morphine Sulfate Injection consumption in men compared to women is present in the literature, clinically significant differences in analgesic outcomes and pharmacokinetic parameters have not been consistently demonstrated. Some studies have shown an increased sensitivity to the adverse effects of Morphine Sulfate Injection, including respiratory depression, in women compared to men. Hepatic Impairment Morphine pharmacokinetics are altered in patients with cirrhosis. Clearance was found to decrease with a corresponding increase in half-life. The M3G and M6G to morphine plasma AUC ratios also decreased in these patients, indicating diminished metabolic activity. Adequate studies of the pharmacokinetics of morphine in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been conducted. Renal Impairment Morphine pharmacokinetics are altered in patients with renal failure. The AUC is increased and clearance is decreased and the metabolites, M3G and M6G, may accumulate to much higher plasma levels in patients with renal failure as compared to patients with normal renal function.

The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8 to 12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours.

Electrical activity in the SA and AV nodes depends, to a large degree, upon calcium influx through the slow channel. By inhibiting this influx, verapamil slows AV conduction and prolongs the effective refractory period within the AV node in a rate-related manner. This effect results in a reduction of the ventricular rate in patients with atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular response. By interrupting reentry at the AV node, verapamil can restore normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT), including PSVT associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Verapamil does not induce peripheral arterial spasm. Verapamil has a local anesthetic action that is 1.6 times that of procaine on an equimolar basis. It is not known whether this action is important at the doses used in man. Verapamil does not alter total serum calcium levels. Hemodynamics Verapamil reduces afterload and myocardial contractility. The commonly used intravenous doses of 5 to 10 mg verapamil hydrochloride produce transient, usually asymptomatic, reduction in normal systemic arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and contractility; left ventricular filling pressure is slightly increased. In most patients, including those with organic cardiac disease, the negative inotropic action of verapamil is countered by reduction of afterload, and cardiac index is usually not reduced. However, in patients with moderately severe to severe cardiac dysfunction (pulmonary wedge pressure above 20 mm Hg, ejection fraction less than 30%), acute worsening of heart failure may be seen. Peak therapeutic effects occur within 3 to 5 minutes after a bolus injection. Pharmacokinetics Intravenously administered verapamil hydrochloride has been shown to be rapidly metabolized. Following intravenous infusion in man, verapamil is eliminated bi-exponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (half-life about 4 minutes) and a slower terminal elimination phase (half-life 2 to 5 hours). In healthy men, orally administered verapamil hydrochloride undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, with 12 metabolites having been identified, most in only trace amounts. The major metabolites have been identified as various N- and O-dealkylated products of verapamil. Approximately 70% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and 16% more in the feces within 5 days. About 3% to 4% is excreted as unchanged drug.

Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein.

The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours.

Also, Naloxone can reverse the psychotomimetic and dysphoric effects of agonist-antagonists such as pentazocine. Naloxone is an essentially pure opioid antagonist, i.e., it does not possess the \"agonistic\" or morphine-like properties characteristic of other opioid antagonists. When administered in usual doses and in the absence of opioids or agonistic effects of other opioid antagonists, it exhibits essentially no pharmacologic activity. Naloxone has not been shown to produce tolerance or cause physical or psychological dependence. In the presence of physical dependence on opioids, naloxone will produce withdrawal symptoms. However, in the presence of opioid dependence, opiate withdrawal symptoms may appear within minutes of naloxone administration and will subside in about 2 hours. The severity and duration of the withdrawal syndrome are related to the dose of naloxone and to the degree and type of opioid dependence. While the mechanism of action of naloxone is not fully understood, in vitro evidence suggests that naloxone antagonizes opioid effects by competing for the mu, kappa, and sigma opiate receptor sites in the CNS, with the greatest affinity for the mu receptor. When naloxone hydrochloride is administered intravenously, the onset of action is generally apparent within two minutes; the onset of action is slightly less rapid when it is administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. The duration of action is dependent upon the dose and route of administration of naloxone hydrochloride. Intramuscular administration produces a more prolonged effect than intravenous administration. Since the duration of action of naloxone may be shorter than that of some opiates, the effects of the opiate may return as the effects of naloxone dissipates. The requirement for repeat doses of naloxone, however, will also be dependent upon the amount, type and route of administration of the opioid being antagonized. Adjunctive Use in Septic Shock Naloxone has been shown in some cases of septic shock to produce a rise in blood pressure that may last up to several hours; however this pressor response has not been demonstrated to improve patient survival. In some studies, treatment with naloxone in the setting of septic shock has been associated with adverse effects, including agitation, nausea and vomiting, pulmonary edema, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures. The decision to use naloxone in septic shock should be exercised with caution, particularly in patients who may have underlying pain or have previously received opioid therapy and may have developed opioid tolerance.

Allopurinol Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Allopurinol is a structural analogue of the natural purine base, hypoxanthine. Allopurinol and its oxypurinol metabolite inhibitor xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and of xanthine to uric acid, the end product of purine metabolism in humans. Allopurinol does not disrupt the biosynthesis of purines. The action of oral allopurinol differs from that of uricosuric agents, which lower the serum uric acid level by increasing urinary excretion of uric acid. Allopurinol reduces both the serum and urinary uric acid levels by inhibiting the formation of uric acid. The use of allopurinol to block the formation of urates avoids the hazard of increased renal excretion of uric acid posed by uricosuric drugs. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Allopurinol reduces the production of uric acid by inhibiting the biochemical reactions immediately preceding its formation in a dose dependent manner. The pharmacological action of allopurinol is generally believed to be mediated by its oxypurinol metabolite. Effect on Hypoxanthine and Xanthine Reutilization of both hypoxanthine and xanthine for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis is markedly enhanced when their oxidations are inhibited by allopurinol and oxypurinol. This reutilization does not disrupt normal nucleic acid anabolism because feedback inhibition is an integral part of purine biosynthesis. As a result of xanthine oxidase inhibition, the serum concentration of hypoxanthine plus xanthine in patients receiving allopurinol for treatment of hyperuricemia is usually in the range of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/dL compared to a normal level of approximately 0.15 mg/dL. A maximum of 0.9 mg/dL of these oxypurines has been reported when the serum urate was lowered to less than 2 mg/dL by high doses of allopurinol. These values are far below the saturation levels, at which point their precipitation would be expected to occur (above 7 mg/dL). The increased xanthine and hypoxanthine in the urine in patients who were treated with oral allopurinol have not been accompanied by problems of nephrolithiasis; however, there are isolated case reports of xanthine crystalluria. Drug Interaction Studies Fluorouracil Based on non-clinical data, allopurinol may decrease anti-tumor activity due to suppression of phosphorylation of 5-fluorouracil. Pegloticase Concomitant use of ALOPRIM and pegloticase may potentially blunt the rise of serum uric acid levels required for monitoring the safe use of pegloticase. Cytotoxic Agents Enhanced bone marrow suppression by cyclophosphamide and other cytotoxic agents has been reported among patients with neoplastic disease, except leukemia, in the presence of allopurinol. Thiazide Diuretics Reports that the concomitant administration of allopurinol and thiazide diuretics contributed to increased allopurinol toxicity were reviewed; however, a causal mechanism or cause-and-effect relationship was not found. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following single 100 mg and 300 mg intravenous and oral administration of ALOPRIM, the relative intravenous Cmax was approximately 3-fold and 3.8-fold and AUC 0-inf was approximately 1.9-fold higher for allopurinol at both dosages, respectively. The relative intravenous oxypurinol C max and AUC 0-inf was approximately 1 compaired to oral administration at both dosages. The C max and AUC 0- inf for both allopurinol and oxypurinol following intravenous administration of ALOPRIM were dose proportional in the dose range of 100 to 300 mg. Distribution The steady-state allopurinol volume of distribution (mean \u00b1 S.D.) is approximately 0.87 \u00b1 0.13 L/Kg following intravenous adminstration. Elimination The half-life (mean \u00b1 S.D.) of allopurinol and oxypurinol are approximately 1.21 \u00b1 0.33 and 23.5 \u00b1 4.5 hours following intravenous administration, respectively. The net renal clearance of oxypurinol about 30 mL/min. Metabolism Allopurinol is a weak CYP1A2 inhibitor. Allopurinol is rapidly eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily via oxidative metabolism to oxypurinol. The oxypurinol (alloxanthine) metabolite is also a xanthine oxidase inhibitor and is present in systemic circulation in much higher concentrations and for a much longer period than allopurinol. In general, the ratio of the area under the plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC 0-inf ) between oxypurinol and allopurinol was in the magnitude of 30 to 40. Excretion Approximately 12% of an allopurinol intravenous dose was excreted unchanged, 76% excreted as oxypurinol, and the remaining dose excreted as riboside conjugates in the urine. Oxypurinol was primarily eliminated unchanged in urine by glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption. Drug Interaction Studies Capecitabine Concomitant use with allopurinol may decrease concentration of capecitabine\u2019s active metabolites, which may decrease capecitabine efficacy. Cyclosporine Concomitant use of allopurinol increases cyclosporine concentrations which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Mercaptopurine or Azathioprine Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine and azathioprine. Concomitant use of allopurinol increases the exposure of either mercaptopurine or azathioprine which may increase the risk of their adverse reactions including myelosuppression. Theophylline Concomitant use of allopurinol doses greater than or equal to 600 mg/day may decrease the clearance of theophylline. Uricosuric Agents Uricosuric agents increase the excretion of the active allopurinol metabolite oxypurinol. Concomitant use with uricosuric agents decreases oxypurinol exposure which may reduce the inhibition of xanthine oxidase by oxypurinol and increases the urinary excretion of uric acid. Warfarin Allopurinol may inhibit the metabolism of warfarin, possibly enhancing its anticoagulant effect. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics The HLA-B*58:01 allele is a genetic marker for severe skin reactions indicative of hypersensitivity to allopurinol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro . Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following twice weekly administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 bortezomib doses, the maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (relative to baseline) in whole blood was observed five minutes after drug administration. Comparable maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was observed between 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses.

Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m 2 dose to patients with multiple myeloma, the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC last ) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The AUC last geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) was 0.99 (0.80 to 1.23). The C max after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/mL) was lower than after intravenous administration (223 ng/mL) with repeat dose administration.

Elimination The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively. Metabolism Bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized to several inactive metabolites in vitro via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9.

The half-life following IV administration was approximately 1.9 hours. Less than 10% of ceftazidime was protein bound. The degree of protein binding was independent of concentration. There was no evidence of accumulation of ceftazidime in the serum in individuals with normal renal function following multiple IV doses of 1 and 2 g every 8 hours for 10 days. Following intramuscular (IM) administration of 500 mg and 1 g doses of ceftazidime to normal adult volunteers, the mean peak serum concentrations were 17 and 39 mcg/mL, respectively, at approximately 1 hour. Serum concentrations remained above 4 mcg/mL for 6 and 8 hours after the IM administration of 500 mg and 1 g doses, respectively. The half-life of ceftazidime in these volunteers was approximately 2 hours. The presence of hepatic dysfunction had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime in individuals administered 2 g intravenously every 8 hours for 5 days. Therefore, a dosage adjustment from the normal recommended dosage is not required for patients with hepatic dysfunction, provided renal function is not impaired. Approximately 80% to 90% of an IM or IV dose of ceftazidime is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 24-hour period. After the IV administration of single 500 mg or 1 g doses, approximately 50% of the dose appeared in the urine in the first 2 hours. An additional 20% was excreted between 2 and 4 hours after dosing, and approximately another 12% of the dose appeared in the urine between 4 and 8 hours later. The elimination of ceftazidime by the kidneys resulted in high therapeutic concentrations in the urine. The mean renal clearance of ceftazidime was approximately 100 mL/min. The calculated plasma clearance of approximately 115 mL/min indicated nearly complete elimination of ceftazidime by the renal route. Administration of probenecid before dosing had no effect on the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime. This suggested that ceftazidime is eliminated by glomerular filtration and is not actively secreted by renal tubular mechanisms. Since ceftazidime is eliminated almost solely by the kidneys, its serum half-life is significantly prolonged in patients with impaired renal function.

Ceftazidime has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Mechanism of Resistance Resistance to ceftazidime is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In an in vitro study, antagonistic effects have been observed with the combination of chloramphenicol and ceftazidime. Ceftazidime has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-negative bacteria Citrobacter species Enterobacter species Escherichia coli Klebsiella species Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Pseudomonas aeruginosa Serratia species Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Streptococcus agalactiae Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides species (Note: many isolates of Bacteroides species are resistant) The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following microorganisms exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for ceftazidime. However, the efficacy of ceftazidime in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Several transient reactive species are formed, including monoaquo and diaquo DACH platinum, which covalently bind with macromolecules. Both inter- and intrastrand Pt-DNA crosslinks are formed. Crosslinks are formed between the N7 positions of two adjacent guanines (GG), adjacent adenine-guanines (AG), and guanines separated by an intervening nucleotide (GNG). These crosslinks inhibit DNA replication and transcription. Cytotoxicity is cell-cycle nonspecific. In vivo studies have shown antitumor activity of oxaliplatin against colon carcinoma. In combination with fluorouracil, oxaliplatin exhibits in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative activity greater than either compound alone in several tumor models (HT29 [colon], GR [mammary], and L1210 [leukemia]). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A pharmacodynamic relationship between platinum ultrafiltrate levels and clinical safety and effectiveness has not been established. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The reactive oxaliplatin derivatives are present as a fraction of the unbound platinum in plasma ultrafiltrate. After a single 2-hour intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin at a dose of 85 mg/m 2 , pharmacokinetic parameters expressed as ultrafiltrable platinum were C max of 0.814 mcg/mL and volume of distribution of 440 L. Interpatient and intrapatient variability in ultrafiltrable platinum exposure (AUC 0\u201348hr ) assessed over 3 cycles was 23% and 6%, respectively. Distribution At the end of a 2-hour infusion of oxaliplatin, approximately 15% of the administered platinum is present in the systemic circulation. The remaining 85% is rapidly distributed into tissues or eliminated in the urine. The decline of ultrafiltrable platinum levels following oxaliplatin administration is triphasic, including two distribution phases (t 1/2\u03b1 ; 0.43 hours and t 1/2\u03b2 ; 16.8 hours). In patients, plasma protein binding of platinum is irreversible and is greater than 90%. The main binding proteins are albumin and gamma-globulins. Platinum also binds irreversibly and accumulates (approximately 2-fold) in erythrocytes, where it appears to have no relevant activity. No platinum accumulation was observed in plasma ultrafiltrate following 85 mg/m 2 every two weeks. Elimination The decline of ultrafiltrable platinum concentrations from plasma is characterized by a long terminal elimination phase (t 1/2\u03b3 ; 391 hour). Metabolism Oxaliplatin undergoes rapid and extensive nonenzymatic biotransformation. There is no evidence of cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism in vitro . Up to 17 platinum-containing derivatives have been observed in plasma ultrafiltrate samples from patients, including several cytotoxic species (monochloro DACH platinum, dichloro DACH platinum, and monoaquo and diaquo DACH platinum) and a number of noncytotoxic, conjugated species. Excretion The major route of platinum elimination is renal excretion. At five days after a single 2-hour infusion of oxaliplatin, urinary elimination accounted for about 54% of the platinum eliminated, with fecal excretion accounting for only about 2%. Platinum was cleared from plasma at a rate (10 to 17 L/h) that was similar to or exceeded the average human glomerular filtration rate (GFR; 7.5 L/h). The renal clearance of ultrafiltrable platinum is significantly correlated with GFR. Special Populations Sex There was no significant effect of sex on the clearance of ultrafiltrable platinum. Patients with renal impairment Patients with normal function (CLcr greater than 80 mL/min) and patients with mild (CLcr=50 to 80 mL/min) and moderate (CLcr equal to 30 to 49 mL/min) renal impairment received oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2 and those with severe (CLcr less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment received oxaliplatin 65 mg/m 2 . Mean dose adjusted AUC of unbound platinum was 40%, 95%, and 342% higher for patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Mean dose adjusted C max of unbound platinum appeared to be similar among the normal, mild and moderate renal function groups, but was 38% higher in the severe group than in the normal group [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Drug Interaction Studies No pharmacokinetic interaction between oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2 and infusional fluorouracil has been observed in patients treated every 2 weeks, but increases of fluorouracil plasma concentrations by approximately 20% have been observed with doses of 130 mg/m 2 of oxaliplatin administered every 3 weeks.

Once spontaneous recovery has reached 25% of control T 1 , the neuromuscular block produced by rocuronium bromide is readily reversed with anticholinesterase agents, e.g., edrophonium or neostigmine. The median spontaneous recovery from 25% to 75% T 1 was 13 minutes in adult patients.

There were no reports of less than satisfactory clinical recovery of neuromuscular function. The neuromuscular blocking action of rocuronium bromide may be enhanced in the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics [see Drug Interactions (7.3)] . Hemodynamics There were no dose-related effects on the incidence of changes from baseline (30% or greater) in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) or heart rate associated with rocuronium bromide administration over the dose range of 0.12 to 1.2 mg/kg (4 x ED 95 ) within 5 minutes after rocuronium bromide administration and prior to intubation. Increases or decreases in MAP were observed in 2% to 5% of geriatric and other adult patients, and in about 1% of pediatric patients. Heart rate changes (30% or greater) occurred in 0% to 2% of geriatric and other adult patients. Tachycardia (30% or greater) occurred in 12 of 127 pediatric patients. Most of the pediatric patients developing tachycardia were from a single study where the patients were anesthetized with halothane and who did not receive atropine for induction [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] . In U.S. studies, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation following rocuronium bromide administration were accompanied by transient tachycardia (30% or greater increases) in about one-third of adult patients under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. Animal studies have indicated that the ratio of vagal:neuromuscular block following rocuronium bromide administration is less than vecuronium but greater than pancuronium. The tachycardia observed in some patients may result from this vagal blocking activity. Histamine Release In studies of histamine release, clinically significant concentrations of plasma histamine occurred in 1 of 88 patients. Clinical signs of histamine release (flushing, rash, or bronchospasm) associated with the administration of rocuronium bromide were assessed in clinical trials and reported in 9 of 1137 (0.8%) patients.

These population-based estimates and a measure of the estimate variability are contained in the following section. Following intravenous administration of rocuronium bromide injection, plasma levels of rocuronium follow a three-compartment open model. The rapid distribution half-life is 1 to 2 minutes and the slower distribution half-life is 14 to 18 minutes. Rocuronium is approximately 30% bound to human plasma proteins. In geriatric and other adult surgical patients undergoing either opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen or inhalational anesthesia, the observed pharmacokinetic profile was essentially unchanged [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Table 7: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults (n = 22; ages 27 to 58 yrs) and Geriatric (n = 20; 65 yrs or greater) During Opioid/Nitrous Oxide/Oxygen Anesthesia PK Parameters Adults (Ages 27 to 58 yrs) Geriatrics (\u226565 yrs) Clearance (L/kg/hr) 0.25 (0.08) 0.21 (0.06) Volume of Distribution at Steady State (L/kg) 0.25 (0.04) 0.22 (0.03) t 1/2 \u03b2 Elimination (hr) 1.4 (0.4) 1.5 (0.4) In general, studies with normal adult subjects did not reveal any differences in the pharmacokinetics of rocuronium due to gender. Studies of distribution, metabolism, and excretion in cats and dogs indicate that rocuronium is eliminated primarily by the liver. The rocuronium analog 17-desacetyl-rocuronium, a metabolite, has been rarely observed in the plasma or urine of humans administered single doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg with or without a subsequent infusion (for up to 12 hr) of rocuronium. In the cat, 17-desacetyl-rocuronium has approximately one-twentieth the neuromuscular blocking potency of rocuronium. The effects of renal failure and hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rocuronium in humans are consistent with these findings. In general, patients undergoing cadaver kidney transplant have a small reduction in clearance which is offset pharmacokinetically by a corresponding increase in volume, such that the net effect is an unchanged plasma half-life. Patients with demonstrated liver cirrhosis have a marked increase in their volume of distribution resulting in a plasma half-life approximately twice that of patients with normal hepatic function. Table 8 shows the pharmacokinetic parameters in subjects with either impaired renal or hepatic function. Table 8: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults with Normal Renal and Hepatic Function (n = 10, ages 23 to 65), Renal Transplant Patients (n = 10, ages 21 to 45), and Hepatic Dysfunction Patients (n = 9, ages 31 to 67) During Isoflurane Anesthesia * Differences in the calculated t 1/2 \u03b2 and Cl between this study and the study in young adults vs. geriatrics (\u226565 years) is related to the different sample populations and anesthetic techniques. PK Parameters Normal Renal and Hepatic Function Renal Transplant Patients Hepatic Dysfunction Patients Clearance (L/kg/hr) 0.16 (0.05) * 0.13 (0.04) 0.13 (0.06) Volume of Distribution at Steady State (L/kg) 0.26 (0.03) 0.34 (0.11) 0.53 (0.14) t 1/2 \u03b2 Elimination (hr) 2.4 (0.8) * 2.4 (1.1) 4.3 (2.6) The net result of these findings is that subjects with renal failure have clinical durations that are similar to but somewhat more variable than the duration that one would expect in subjects with normal renal function. Hepatically impaired patients, due to the large increase in volume, may demonstrate clinical durations approaching 1.5 times that of subjects with normal hepatic function. In both populations the clinician should individualize the dose to the needs of the patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Tissue redistribution accounts for most (about 80%) of the initial amount of rocuronium administered. As tissue compartments fill with continued dosing (4 to 8 hours), less drug is redistributed away from the site of action and, for an infusion-only dose, the rate to maintain neuromuscular blockade falls to about 20% of the initial infusion rate. The use of a loading dose and a smaller infusion rate reduces the need for adjustment of dose. Pediatric Patients Under halothane anesthesia, the clinical duration of effects of rocuronium bromide did not vary with age in patients 4 months to 8 years of age. The terminal half-life and other pharmacokinetic parameters of rocuronium in these pediatric patients are presented in Table 9. Table 9: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Rocuronium in Pediatric Patients (ages 3 to less than 12 mos, n = 6; 1 to less than 3 yrs, n = 5; 3 to less than 8 yrs, n = 7) During Halothane Anesthesia PK Parameters Patient Age Range 3 to <12 mos 1 to <3 yrs 3 to <8 yrs Clearance (L/kg/hr) 0.35 (0.08) 0.32 (0.07) 0.44 (0.16) Volume of Distribution at Steady State (L/kg) 0.30 (0.04) 0.26 (0.06) 0.21 (0.03) t 1/2 \u03b2 Elimination (hr) 1.3 (0.5) 1.1 (0.7) 0.8 (0.3) Pharmacokinetics of rocuronium bromide were evaluated using a population analysis of the pooled pharmacokinetic datasets from 2 trials under sevoflurane (induction) and isoflurane/nitrous oxide (maintenance) anesthesia. All pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be linearly proportional to body weight. In patients under the age of 18 years clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vss) increase with bodyweight (kg) and age (years). As a result the terminal half-life of rocuronium bromide decreases with increasing age from 1.1 hour to 0.7 to 0.8 hour. Table 10 presents the pharmacokinetic parameters in the different age groups in the studies with sevoflurane (induction) and isoflurane/nitrous oxide (maintenance) anesthesia.

This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the (H + , K + )-ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours for all doses tested (20 mg to 120 mg). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Antisecretory Activity The magnitude and time course for inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated acid output (PSAO) by single doses (20 to 120 mg) of pantoprazole sodium for injection were assessed in a single-dose, open-label, placebo-controlled, dose-response study. The results of this study are shown in Table 3. Healthy subjects received a continuous infusion for 25 hours of pentagastrin (PG) at 1 mcg/kg/h, a dose known to produce submaximal gastric acid secretion. The placebo group showed a sustained, continuous acid output for 25 hours, validating the reliability of the testing model. Pantoprazole sodium for injection had an onset of antisecretory activity within 15 to 30 minutes of administration. Doses of 20 to 80 mg of pantoprazole sodium for injection substantially reduced the 24-hour cumulative PSAO in a dose-dependent manner, despite a short plasma elimination half-life. Complete suppression of PSAO was achieved with 80 mg within approximately 2 hours and no further significant suppression was seen with 120 mg. The duration of action of pantoprazole sodium for injection was 24 hours.

NA = not applicable. b: Inhibition of gastric acid output and the percent inhibition of stimulated acid output in response to pantoprazole sodium for injection may be higher after repeated doses. In one study of gastric pH in healthy subjects, pantoprazole sodium was administered orally (40 mg enteric coated tablets) or pantoprazole sodium for injection (40 mg) once daily for 5 days and pH was measured for 24 hours following the fifth dose. The outcome measure was median percent of time that pH was \u22654 and the results were similar for intravenous and oral medications; however, the clinical significance of this parameter is unknown. Serum Gastrin Effects Serum gastrin concentrations were assessed in two placebo-controlled studies. In a 5-day study of oral pantoprazole with 40 and 60 mg doses in healthy subjects, following the last dose on day 5, median 24-hour serum gastrin concentrations were elevated by 3- to 4-fold compared to placebo in both 40 and 60 mg dose groups. However, by 24 hours following the last dose, median serum gastrin concentrations for both groups returned to normal levels. In another placebo-controlled, 7-day study of 40 mg intravenous or oral pantoprazole in patients with GERD and a history of EE, the mean serum gastrin concentration increased approximately 50% from baseline and as compared with placebo, but remained within the normal range. During 6 days of repeated administration of pantoprazole sodium for injection in patients with ZE Syndrome, consistent changes of serum gastrin concentrations from baseline were not observed. Enterochromaffin-Like (ECL) Cell Effects There are no data available on the effects of intravenous pantoprazole sodium on ECL cells. In a nonclinical study in Sprague-Dawley rats, lifetime exposure (24 months) to oral pantoprazole at doses of 0.5 to 200 mg/kg/day resulted in dose-related increases in gastric ECL-cell proliferation and gastric neuroendocrine (NE)-cell tumors. Gastric NE-cell tumors in rats may result from chronic elevation of serum gastrin concentrations. The high density of ECL cells in the rat stomach makes this species highly susceptible to the proliferative effects of elevated gastrin concentrations produced by PPIs. However, there were no observed elevations in serum gastrin following the administration of oral pantoprazole at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day. In a separate study, a gastric NE-cell tumor without concomitant ECL-cell proliferative changes was observed in 1 female rat following 12 months of dosing with oral pantoprazole at 5 mg/kg/day and a 9 month off-dose recovery [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Endocrine Effects In a clinical pharmacology study, pantoprazole 40 mg given orally once daily for 2 weeks had no effect on the levels of the following hormones: cortisol, testosterone, triiodothyronine (T 3 ), thyroxine (T 4 ), thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyronine-binding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin, aldosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin and growth hormone. In a 1-year study of GERD patients treated with pantoprazole 40 mg or 20 mg, there were no changes from baseline in overall levels of T 3 , T 4 , and TSH. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pantoprazole peak serum concentration (C max ) and area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) increase in a manner proportional to intravenous doses from 10 mg to 80 mg. Pantoprazole does not accumulate and its pharmacokinetics are unaltered with multiple daily dosing. Following the administration of pantoprazole sodium for injection, the serum concentration of pantoprazole declines biexponentially with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately one hour. In CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] with normal liver function receiving a 40 mg dose of pantoprazole sodium for injection by constant rate over 15 minutes, the peak concentration (C max ) is 5.52 \u00b11.42 mcg/mL and the total area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) is 5.4 \u00b11.5 mcg hr/mL. The total clearance is 7.6 to 14 L/h. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of pantoprazole is approximately 11 to 23.6 L, distributing mainly in extracellular fluid. The serum protein binding of pantoprazole is about 98%, primarily to albumin. Elimination Metabolism Pantoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Pantoprazole metabolism is independent of the route of administration (intravenous or oral). The main metabolic pathway is demethylation, by CYP2C19, with subsequent sulfation; other metabolic pathways include oxidation by CYP3A4. There is no evidence that any of the pantoprazole metabolites have significant pharmacologic activity. CYP2C19 displays a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some sub-populations (e.g., 3% of Caucasians and African-Americans and 17 to 23% of Asians). Although these sub-populations of slow pantoprazole metabolizers have elimination half-life values from 3.5 to 10 hours, they still have minimal accumulation (23% or less) with once daily dosing. Excretion After administration of a single intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled pantoprazole sodium to healthy, extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers, approximately 71% of the dose was excreted in the urine with 18% excreted in the feces through biliary excretion. There was no renal excretion of unchanged pantoprazole. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients After repeated intravenous administration in elderly subjects (65 to 76 years of age), the AUC and elimination half-life values of pantoprazole were similar to those observed in younger subjects. Male and Female Patients After oral administration there was a modest increase in the AUC and C max of pantoprazole in women compared to men. However, weight-normalized clearance values are similar in women and men. Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment, pharmacokinetic parameters for pantoprazole were similar to those of healthy subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A to C), maximum pantoprazole concentrations increased only slightly (1.5-fold) relative to healthy subjects when pantoprazole sodium was administered orally. Although serum half-life values increased to 7 to 9 hours and AUC values increased by 5- to 7-fold in hepatic-impaired patients, these increases were no greater than those observed in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, where no dosage adjustment is warranted. These pharmacokinetic changes in hepatic-impaired patients result in minimal drug accumulation following once-daily, multiple-dose administration. Oral pantoprazole doses higher than 40 mg per day have not been studied in hepatically impaired patients. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on Pantoprazole Pantoprazole is metabolized mainly by CYP2C19 and to minor extents by CYPs 3A4, 2D6 and 2C9. In in vivo drug-drug interaction studies with CYP2C19 substrates (diazepam [also a CYP3A4 substrate] and phenytoin [also a CYP3A4 inducer]), nifedipine, midazolam, and clarithromycin (CYP3A4 substrates), metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate), diclofenac, naproxen and piroxicam (CYP2C9 substrates) and theophylline (a CYP1A2 substrate) in healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole were not significantly altered. Effect of Pantoprazole on Other Drugs Clopidogrel Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. In a crossover clinical study, 66 healthy subjects were administered clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg per day) alone and with oral pantoprazole (80 mg at the same time as clopidogrel) for 5 days. On Day 5, the mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 14% (geometric mean ratio was 86%, with 90% CI of 79 to 93%) when pantoprazole sodium was coadministered with clopidogrel as compared to clopidogrel administered alone. Pharmacodynamic parameters were also measured and demonstrated that the change in inhibition of platelet aggregation (induced by 5 micromolar ADP) was correlated with the change in the exposure to clopidogrel active metabolite. The clinical significance of this finding is not clear. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) Administration of oral pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily for 4 days and a single 1000 mg dose of MMF approximately one hour after the last dose of pantoprazole to 12 healthy subjects in a cross-over study resulted in a 57% reduction in the C max and 27% reduction in the AUC of MPA. Transplant patients receiving approximately 2000 mg per day of MMF (n=12) were compared to transplant patients receiving approximately the same dose of MMF and oral pantoprazole 40 mg per day (n=21). There was a 78% reduction in the C max and a 45% reduction in the AUC of MPA in patients receiving both pantoprazole and MMF [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Other Drugs In vivo studies also suggest that pantoprazole does not significantly affect the kinetics of other drugs (cisapride, theophylline, diazepam [and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam], phenytoin, metoprolol, nifedipine, carbamazepine, midazolam, clarithromycin, diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam and oral contraceptives [levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol]). In other in vivo studies, digoxin, ethanol, glyburide, antipyrine, caffeine, metronidazole, and amoxicillin had no clinically relevant interactions with pantoprazole. Although no significant drug-drug interactions have been observed in clinical studies, the potential for significant drug-drug interactions with more than once daily dosing with high doses of pantoprazole has not been studied in poor metabolizers or individuals who are hepatically impaired. Antacids There was also no interaction with concomitantly administered antacids. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C19 displays a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some subpopulations (e.g., approximately 3% of Caucasians and African-Americans and 17% to 23% of Asians are poor metabolizers). Although these subpopulations of pantoprazole poor metabolizers have elimination half-life values of 3.5 to 10.0 hours in adults, they still have minimal accumulation (23% or less) with once-daily dosing. For adult patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, no dosage adjustment is needed. Similar to adults, pediatric patients who have the poor metabolizer genotype of CYP2C19 (CYP2C19 *2/*2) exhibited greater than a 6-fold increase in AUC compared to pediatric extensive (CYP2C19 *1/*1) and intermediate (CYP2C19 *1/*x) metabolizers. Poor metabolizers exhibited approximately 10-fold lower apparent oral clearance compared to extensive metabolizers."], "manufacturer_name": ["Novadoz Pharmaceuticals LLC"], "substance_name": ["PANTOPRAZOLE SODIUM"], "effective_time": "20220303", "product_ndc": ["72205-180"], "brand_name": ["Pantoprazole Sodium"]}

Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42\u00b134%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110\u00b145%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067\u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4 . The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Coadministration of 0.25 mg palonosetron hydrochloride injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."], "manufacturer_name": ["Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc."], "substance_name": ["PALONOSETRON HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20230817", "product_ndc": ["71288-409"], "brand_name": ["Palonosetron Hydrochloride"]}

Table 2 Effect of Intravenous Ranitidine Hydrochloride on Gastric Acid Secretion Time After Dose, hours % Inhibition of Gastric Acid Output by Intravenous Dose, mg 20 mg 60 mg 100 mg Betazole Up to 2 93 99 99 Pentagastrin Up to 3 47 66 77 In a group of 10 known hypersecretors, ranitidine plasma levels of 71, 180, and 376 ng/mL inhibited basal acid secretion by 76%, 90%, and 99.5%, respectively. It appears that basal- and betazole-stimulated secretions are most sensitive to inhibition by ranitidine hydrochloride, while pentagastrin-stimulated secretion is more difficult to suppress. 2. Effects on Other Gastrointestinal Secretions Pepsin Ranitidine hydrochloride does not affect pepsin secretion. Total pepsin output is reduced in proportion to the decrease in volume of gastric juice. Intrinsic Factor Ranitidine hydrochloride has no significant effect on pentagastrin-stimulated intrinsic factor secretion. Serum Gastrin Ranitidine hydrochloride has little or no effect on fasting or postprandial serum gastrin. Other Pharmacologic Actions Gastric bacterial flora - increase in nitrate-reducing organisms, significance not known. Prolactin levels - no effect in recommended oral or intravenous dosage, but small, transient, dose-related increases in serum prolactin have been reported after intravenous bolus injections of 100 mg or more. Other pituitary hormones - no effect on serum gonadotropins, TSH, or GH. Possible impairment of vasopressin release. No change in cortisol, aldosterone, androgen, or estrogen levels. No antiandrogenic action. No effect on count, motility, or morphology of sperm. Pediatrics The ranitidine concentration necessary to suppress basal acid secretion by at least 90% has been reported to be 40 to 60 ng/mL in pediatric patients with duodenal or gastric ulcers. In a study of 20 critically ill pediatric patients receiving ranitidine intravenous at 1 mg/kg every 6 hours, 10 patients with a baseline pH \u2265 4 maintained this baseline throughout the study. Eight of the remaining 10 patients with a baseline of pH \u2264 2 achieved pH \u2265 4 throughout varying periods after dosing. It should be noted, however, that because these pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed in critically ill pediatric patients, the data should be interpreted with caution when dosing recommendations are made for a less seriously ill pediatric population. In another small study of neonatal patients (n = 5) receiving ECMO, gastric pH < 4 pretreatment increased to > 4 after a 2 mg/kg dose and remained above 4 for at least 15 hours. Clinical Trials Active Duodenal Ulcer In a multicenter, double-blind, controlled, US study of endoscopically diagnosed duodenal ulcers, earlier healing was seen in the patients treated with oral ranitidine hydrochloride as shown in Table 3.

Use of oral ranitidine hydrochloride was followed by healing of ulcers in 8 of 19 (42%) patients who were intractable to previous therapy. In a retrospective review of 52 Zollinger-Ellison patients given ranitidine hydrochloride as a continuous intravenous infusion for up to 15 days, no patients developed complications of acid-peptic disease such as bleeding or perforation.

Plasma Concentrations of Linezolid in Adults at Steady-State Following Oral Dosing Every 12 Hours (Mean \u00b1 Standard Deviation, n=16) Absorption Linezolid is extensively absorbed after oral dosing. Maximum plasma concentrations are reached approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing, and the absolute bioavailability is approximately 100%. Therefore, linezolid may be given orally or intravenously without dose adjustment. Linezolid may be administered without regard to the timing of meals. The time to reach the maximum concentration is delayed from 1.5 hours to 2.2 hours and C max is decreased by about 17% when high fat food is given with linezolid. However, the total exposure measured as AUC 0\u2013\u221e is similar under both conditions. Distribution Animal and human pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that linezolid readily distributes to well-perfused tissues. The plasma protein binding of linezolid is approximately 31% and is concentration-independent. The volume of distribution of linezolid at steady-state averaged 40 to 50 liters in healthy adult volunteers. Linezolid concentrations have been determined in various fluids from a limited number of subjects in Phase 1 volunteer studies following multiple dosing of linezolid. The ratio of linezolid in saliva relative to plasma was 1.2 to 1 and the ratio of linezolid in sweat relative to plasma was 0.55 to 1. Metabolism Linezolid is primarily metabolized by oxidation of the morpholine ring, which results in two inactive ring-opened carboxylic acid metabolites: the aminoethoxyacetic acid metabolite (A), and the hydroxyethyl glycine metabolite (B). Formation of metabolite A is presumed to be formed via an enzymatic pathway whereas metabolite B is mediated by a non-enzymatic chemical oxidation mechanism in vitro. In vitro studies have demonstrated that linezolid is minimally metabolized and may be mediated by human cytochrome P450. However, the metabolic pathway of linezolid is not fully understood. Excretion Nonrenal clearance accounts for approximately 65% of the total clearance of linezolid. Under steady-state conditions, approximately 30% of the dose appears in the urine as linezolid, 40% as metabolite B, and 10% as metabolite A. The mean renal clearance of linezolid is 40 mL/min which suggests net tubular reabsorption. Virtually no linezolid appears in the feces, while approximately 6% of the dose appears in the feces as metabolite B, and 3% as metabolite A. A small degree of nonlinearity in clearance was observed with increasing doses of linezolid, which appears to be due to lower renal and nonrenal clearance of linezolid at higher concentrations. However, the difference in clearance was small and was not reflected in the apparent elimination half-life. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of linezolid are not significantly altered in elderly patients (65 years or older). Therefore, dose adjustment for geriatric patients is not necessary. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of linezolid following a single intravenous dose were investigated in pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 17 years (including premature and full-term neonates), in healthy adolescent subjects ranging in age from 12 through 17 years, and in pediatric patients ranging in age from 1 week through 12 years. The pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid are summarized in Table 9 for the pediatric populations studied and healthy adult subjects after administration of single intravenous doses. The C max and the volume of distribution (V ss ) of linezolid are similar regardless of age in pediatric patients. However, plasma clearance of linezolid varies as a function of age. With the exclusion of pre-term neonates less than one week of age, weight-based clearance is most rapid in the youngest age groups ranging from < 1 week old to 11 years, resulting in lower single-dose systemic exposure (AUC) and a shorter half-life as compared with adults. As the age of pediatric patients increases, the weight-based clearance of linezolid gradually decreases, and by adolescence mean clearance values approach those observed for the adult population. There is increased inter-subject variability in linezolid clearance and systemic drug exposure (AUC) across all pediatric age groups as compared with adults. Similar mean daily AUC values were observed in pediatric patients from birth to 11 years of age dosed every 8 hours relative to adolescents or adults dosed every 12 hours. Therefore, the dosage for pediatric patients up to 11 years of age should be 10 mg/kg every 8 hours. Pediatric patients 12 years and older should receive 600 mg every 12 hours [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Table 9.

Plasma concentrations are higher in females than in males, which is partly due to body weight differences. After a 600-mg dose, mean oral clearance is approximately 38% lower in females than in males. However, there are no significant gender differences in mean apparent elimination-rate constant or half-life. Thus, drug exposure in females is not expected to substantially increase beyond levels known to be well tolerated. Therefore, dose adjustment by gender does not appear to be necessary. Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of the parent drug, linezolid, are not altered in patients with any degree of renal impairment; however, the two primary metabolites of linezolid accumulate in patients with renal impairment, with the amount of accumulation increasing with the severity of renal dysfunction (see Table 10 ). The pharmacokinetics of linezolid and its two metabolites have also been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis. In the ESRD study, 14 patients were dosed with linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours for 14.5 days (see Table 11 ). Because similar plasma concentrations of linezolid are achieved regardless of renal function, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment. However, given the absence of information on the clinical significance of accumulation of the primary metabolites, use of linezolid in patients with renal impairment should be weighed against the potential risks of accumulation of these metabolites. Both linezolid and the two metabolites are eliminated by hemodialysis. No information is available on the effect of peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid. Approximately 30% of a dose was eliminated in a 3-hour hemodialysis session beginning 3 hours after the dose of linezolid was administered; therefore, linezolid should be given after hemodialysis.

On the basis of the available information, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of linezolid in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been evaluated. Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Linezolid is not an inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) in rats. In addition, linezolid does not inhibit the activities of clinically significant human CYP isoforms (e.g., 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4). Therefore, linezolid is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs metabolized by these major enzymes. Concurrent administration of linezolid does not substantially alter the pharmacokinetic characteristics of (S)-warfarin, which is extensively metabolized by CYP2C9. Drugs such as warfarin and phenytoin, which are CYP2C9 substrates, may be given with linezolid without changes in dosage regimen. Antibacterial Drugs Aztreonam : The pharmacokinetics of linezolid or aztreonam are not altered when administered together. Gentamicin : The pharmacokinetics of linezolid or gentamicin are not altered when administered together. Antioxidants The potential for drug-drug interactions with linezolid and the antioxidants Vitamin C and Vitamin E was studied in healthy volunteers. Subjects were administered a 600 mg oral dose of linezolid on Day 1, and another 600 mg dose of linezolid on Day 8. On Days 2\u20139, subjects were given either Vitamin C (1,000 mg/day) or Vitamin E (800 IU/ day). The AUC 0\u2013\u221e of linezolid increased 2.3% when co-administered with Vitamin C and 10.9% when co-administered with Vitamin E. No linezolid dose adjustment is recommended during co-administration with Vitamin C or Vitamin E. Strong CYP 3A4 Inducers Rifampin: The effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid was evaluated in a study of 16 healthy adult males. Volunteers were administered oral linezolid 600 mg twice daily for 5 doses with and without rifampin 600 mg once daily for 8 days. Co-administration of rifampin with linezolid resulted in a 21% decrease in linezolid C max [90% CI, 15% \u2013 27%] and a 32% decrease in linezolid AUC 0\u201312 [90% CI, 27% \u2013 37%]. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. The mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood and may be related to the induction of hepatic enzymes. Other strong inducers of hepatic enzymes (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) could cause a similar or smaller decrease in linezolid exposure. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibition Linezolid is a reversible, nonselective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Therefore, linezolid has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and serotonergic agents. Adrenergic Agents Some individuals receiving ZYVOX may experience a reversible enhancement of the pressor response to indirect-acting sympathomimetic agents, vasopressor or dopaminergic agents. Commonly used drugs such as phenylpropanolamine and pseudoephedrine have been specifically studied. Initial doses of adrenergic agents, such as dopamine or epinephrine, should be reduced and titrated to achieve the desired response. Tyramine: A significant pressor response has been observed in normal adult subjects receiving linezolid and tyramine doses of more than 100 mg. Therefore, patients receiving linezolid need to avoid consuming large amounts of foods or beverages with high tyramine content [ see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Pseudoephedrine HCl or phenylpropanolamine HCl: A reversible enhancement of the pressor response of either pseudoephedrine HCl (PSE) or phenylpropanolamine HCl (PPA) is observed when linezolid is administered to healthy normotensive subjects [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. A similar study has not been conducted in hypertensive patients. The interaction studies conducted in normotensive subjects evaluated the blood pressure and heart rate effects of placebo, PPA or PSE alone, linezolid alone, and the combination of steady-state linezolid (600 mg every 12 hours for 3 days) with two doses of PPA (25 mg) or PSE (60 mg) given 4 hours apart. Heart rate was not affected by any of the treatments. Blood pressure was increased with both combination treatments. Maximum blood pressure levels were seen 2 to 3 hours after the second dose of PPA or PSE, and returned to baseline 2 to 3 hours after peak. The results of the PPA study follow, showing the mean (and range) maximum systolic blood pressure in mm Hg: placebo = 121 (103 to 158); linezolid alone = 120 (107 to 135); PPA alone = 125 (106 to 139); PPA with linezolid = 147 (129 to 176). The results from the PSE study were similar to those in the PPA study. The mean maximum increase in systolic blood pressure over baseline was 32 mm Hg (range: 20\u201352 mm Hg) and 38 mm Hg (range: 18\u201379 mm Hg) during co-administration of linezolid with pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine, respectively. Serotonergic Agents Dextromethorphan: The potential drug-drug interaction with dextromethorphan was studied in healthy volunteers. Subjects were administered dextromethorphan (two 20-mg doses given 4 hours apart) with or without linezolid. No serotonin syndrome effects (confusion, delirium, restlessness, tremors, blushing, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia) have been observed in normal subjects receiving linezolid and dextromethorphan. Figure 1 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Linezolid is a synthetic antibacterial agent of the oxazolidinone class, which has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of linezolid also includes certain Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. Linezolid binds to a site on the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit and prevents the formation of a functional 70S initiation complex, which is essential for bacterial reproduction. The results of time-kill studies have shown linezolid to be bacteriostatic against enterococci and staphylococci. For streptococci, linezolid was found to be bactericidal for the majority of isolates. Resistance In vitro studies have shown that point mutations in the 23S rRNA are associated with linezolid resistance. Reports of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium becoming resistant to linezolid during its clinical use have been published. There are reports of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant) developing resistance to linezolid during clinical use. The linezolid resistance in these organisms is associated with a point mutation in the 23S rRNA (substitution of thymine for guanine at position 2576) of the organism. Organisms resistant to oxazolidinones via mutations in chromosomal genes encoding 23S rRNA or ribosomal proteins (L3 and L4) are generally cross-resistant to linezolid. Also linezolid resistance in staphylococci mediated by the enzyme methyltransferase has been reported. This resistance is mediated by the cfr (chloramphenicol-florfenicol) gene located on a plasmid which is transferable between staphylococci. Interaction with Other Antimicrobial Drugs In vitro studies have demonstrated additivity or indifference between linezolid and vancomycin, gentamicin, rifampin, imipenem-cilastatin, aztreonam, ampicillin, or streptomycin. Linezolid has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ].

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action ZEMDRI is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The ratio of area under the plasma concentration-time curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC:MIC) for plazomicin has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection against Enterobacteriaceae. Exposure- Response Relationship for Nephrotoxicity in cUTI Patients Based on exposure-response analysis for nephrotoxicity, defined as serum creatinine increases greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/dL from baseline, using the data from two cUTI clinical trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2), development of nephrotoxicity was associated with estimated plazomicin exposure (i.e., the plasma trough concentration [C min ]) in patients with CLcr greater than 30 mL/min and less than or equal to 90 mL/min (N=243). The incidence of nephrotoxicity was higher in patients with plazomicin C min greater than or equal to 3 mcg/mL (36%, 10/28) compared to patients with plazomicin C min less than 3 mcg/mL (5%, 11/215). Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of ZEMDRI on the QTc interval was evaluated in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo and positive controlled, double-blind, single-dose, crossover thorough QTc study in 56 healthy adult subjects. At a single dose of 20 mg/kg (1.3 times the maximum recommended dose), ZEMDRI did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of plazomicin are similar for single- and multiple-dose administration of ZEMDRI in healthy subjects. No appreciable accumulation of plazomicin was observed following multiple IV infusions of 15 mg/kg administered every 24 hours in subjects with normal renal function. The AUC, maximum plasma concentration (C max ), and C min increased in proportion to the dose over the dose range of 4 to 15 mg/kg. The plazomicin AUC, C max , and C min are summarized in Table 4. Table 4: Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Geometric Mean [\u00b1SD]) of Plazomicin Following Administration of ZEMDRI 15 mg/kg by 30-Minute IV Infusion in Healthy Subjects and cUTI Patients with CLcr Greater than or Equal to 90 mL/min Healthy Subjects PK parameters following a single dose of 15 mg/kg; Based on non-compartmental analysis of PK data; AUC 0-inf is reported; C min is concentration at 24 hours. Geometric mean (\u00b1SD) N=54 cUTI Patients Day 1 PK parameters following administration of 15 mg/kg; Derived based on population PK model; AUC 0-24h is reported.

The average binding of plazomicin to human plasma proteins is approximately 20%. The degree of protein binding was concentration-independent across the range tested in vitro (5 to 100 mcg/mL). Elimination The mean (\u00b1SD) total body clearance of plazomicin in healthy adults and cUTI patients is 4.5 (\u00b10.9) and 5.1 (\u00b12.01) L/h, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life of plazomicin was 3.5 h (\u00b10.5) in healthy adults with normal renal function (n=54). Metabolism Plazomicin does not appear to be metabolized to any appreciable extent. Excretion Plazomicin is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Following a single 15 mg/kg IV dose of radiolabeled plazomicin in healthy subjects, 56% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered in urine within 4 hours, 89.1% was recovered within 168 hours, with less than 0.2% in feces. In total, 97.5% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged plazomicin. The mean renal clearance (\u00b1SD) of plazomicin (4.6 [\u00b11.2] L/h) was similar to total body clearance, suggesting that plazomicin is eliminated by the kidneys. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of plazomicin were observed based on age (18 to 90 years of age), sex, or race/ethnicity. The pharmacokinetics of plazomicin in patients with hepatic impairment is unknown. Patients with Renal Impairment Following a single 7.5 mg/kg IV dose (0.5 times the recommended dose) of ZEMDRI as a 30-minute infusion, the geometric mean AUC 0-inf of plazomicin in subjects with mild (CLcr 60 to <90 mL/min, n=6), moderate (CLcr 30 to <60 mL/min, n=6), and severe (CLcr 15 to <30 mL/min, n=6) renal impairment was 1.01-fold, 1.98-fold, and 4.42-fold higher, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function (CLcr \u226590 mL/min, n=6) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Based on the population PK model, the recommended dosage of ZEMDRI was associated with a mean (\u00b1SD) C min of 1.0 (\u00b11.3) and 1.7 (\u00b11.4) mcg/mL in cUTI patients with mild (CLcr 60 to <90 mL/min, n=104) and moderate (CLcr 30 to <60 mL/min, n=89) renal impairment, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) area under the curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC 0-24h ) was 261 (\u00b1102) and 224 (\u00b1147) mcg\u2219h/mL in cUTI patients with mild (CLcr 60 to <90 mL/min, n=104) and moderate (CLcr 30 to <60 mL/min, n=89) renal impairment, respectively. There were insufficient data to calculate C min and AUC 0-24h for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to <30 mL/min). Geriatric Patients No clinically relevant trend in plazomicin exposure (C max and AUC 0-24h ) was observed with regard to age alone. Higher C min in elderly subjects (65 to 90 years of age) as compared to non-elderly adult subjects (18 to 64 years of age) was mainly attributable to age-related changes in renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Based on the results of a clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study that evaluated the effect of a single dose of plazomicin (15 mg/kg) on the single dose plasma PK of metformin, plazomicin did not affect the PK of metformin, which is a substrate of OCT and MATE transporters. In Vitro Studies Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes Plazomicin does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 isoforms: CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5. Plazomicin does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4. Membrane Transporters Plazomicin is not a substrate of P-gp or BCRP transporters. Plazomicin does not inhibit the following hepatic and renal transporters in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations: P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, and OCT2. Plazomicin selectively inhibited the MATE1 and MATE2-K renal transporter in vitro with an IC 50 value of 1300 and 338 mcg/mL, respectively. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Plazomicin is an aminoglycoside that acts by binding to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. Plazomicin has concentration-dependent bactericidal activity as measured by time kill studies. In vitro studies demonstrated a plazomicin post-antibiotic effect ranging from 0.2 to 2.6 hours at 2\u00d7 MIC against Enterobacteriaceae. Resistance Resistance to aminoglycosides includes production of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs), alteration of the ribosomal target through production of 16S rRNA methyltransferases, up-regulation of efflux pumps and reduced permeability into bacterial cell due to loss of outer membrane porins. Plazomicin is not inhibited by most AMEs known to affect gentamicin, amikacin and tobramycin, including acetyltransferases (AACs), phosphotransferases (APHs) and nucleotidyltransferases (ANTs). Plazomicin, like other aminoglycosides, is inactive against bacterial isolates that produce 16S rRNA methyltransferases. Plazomicin may have reduced activity against Enterobacteriaceae that overexpress certain efflux pumps (e.g., acrAB-tolC ) or lower expression of porins (e.g., ompF or ompK36 ). Plazomicin has no in vitro activity against streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae ), enterococci (including Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium ), anaerobes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter spp and variable activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Activity of plazomicin was demonstrated in vitro against Enterobacteriaceae in the presence of certain beta-lactamases, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM, SHV, CTX-M, AmpC), serine carbapenemases (KPC-2, KPC-3), and oxacillinase (OXA-48). Bacteria producing metallo-beta-lactamases often co-express 16S rRNA methyltransferase, conferring resistance to plazomicin. Interaction With Other Antimicrobials In vitro studies have demonstrated that against Enterobacteriaceae isolates, no antagonism was observed for plazomicin in combination with clindamycin, colistin, daptomycin, fosfomycin, levofloxacin, linezolid, rifampin, tigecycline and vancomycin; few isolates showed synergy with ceftazidime, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Animal Infection Models Plazomicin demonstrated activity in animal models of infection (e.g., thigh infection, lung infection, and septicemia) caused by either amikacin-non-susceptible, gentamicin-non-susceptible, or beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae . Antimicrobial Activity ZEMDRI has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1) ] Aerobic Bacteria Gram-negative Bacteria Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae Proteus mirabilis Enterobacter cloacae The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for plazomicin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of ZEMDRI in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Administration of levoleucovorin counteracts the therapeutic and toxic effects of folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. Combination with Fluorouracil in Colorectal Cancer Levoleucovorin enhances the therapeutic and toxic effects of fluorouracil. Fluorouracil is metabolized to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP), which binds to and inhibits thymidylate synthase (an enzyme important in DNA repair and replication). Levoleucovorin is converted to another reduced folate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, which acts to stabilize the binding of FdUMP to thymidylate synthase and thereby enhancing the inhibition of thymidylate synthase. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of levoleucovorin after intravenous administration of a 15 mg dose was studied in healthy subjects. The mean maximum serum total tetrahydrofolate (total-THF) concentrations was 1722 ng/mL (CV 39%) and the mean maximum serum (6S)-5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate concentrations was 275 ng/mL (CV 18%) observed around 0.9 hours post injection.

Diastolic pressure falls. Renal blood flow is decreased in normotensive subjects but is increased markedly in shock. Systolic blood pressure may remain unchanged or rise, although mean arterial pressure typically falls. Cardiac output is increased because of the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of the drug in the face of diminished peripheral vascular resistance. Isoproterenol relaxes almost all varieties of smooth muscle when the tone is high, but this action is most pronounced on bronchial and gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It prevents or relieves bronchoconstriction, but tolerance to this effect develops with overuse of the drug. In man, isoproterenol causes less hyperglycemia than does epinephrine.

Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following twice weekly administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 bortezomib doses, the maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (relative to baseline) in whole blood was observed five minutes after drug administration. Comparable maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was observed between 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses. Maximal inhibition ranged from 70% to 84% and from 73% to 83% for the 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 dose regimens, respectively. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses, the mean maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib (C max ) after the first dose (Day 1) were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively. When administered twice weekly, the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m 2 dose to patients with multiple myeloma, the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC last ) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The AUC last geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) was 0.99 (0.80 to 1.23). The C max after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/mL) was lower than after intravenous administration (223 ng/mL) with repeat dose administration. Distribution The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 L/m 2 following single- or repeat-dose administration of 1 mg/m 2 or 1.3 mg/m 2 to patients with multiple myeloma. The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively. Metabolism Bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized to several inactive metabolites in vitro via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. Excretion The pathways of elimination of bortezomib have not been characterized in humans. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were observed based on age, sex, or renal impairment (including patients administered Bortezomib for Injection after dialysis). The effect of race on bortezomib pharmacokinetics is unknown. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following administration of bortezomib doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/m 2 , mild (total bilirubin \u22641\u00d7 ULN and AST >ULN, or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5\u00d7 ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment did not alter dose-normalized bortezomib AUC when compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Dose normalized mean bortezomib AUC increased by approximately 60% in patients with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3\u00d7 ULN and any AST) or severe (total bilirubin >3\u00d7 ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinically significant differences in bortezomib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with dexamethasone (weak CYP3A4 inducer), omeprazole (strong CYP2C19 inhibitor), or melphalan in combination with prednisone. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor Coadministration with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased bortezomib exposure by 35%. Strong CYP3A4 Inducer Coadministration with rifampin (strong CYP3A4 inducer) decreased bortezomib exposure by approximately 45%.

Docetaxel injection, USP requires NO prior dilution with a diluent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells that is essential for mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel binds to free tubulin and promotes the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly. This leads to the production of microtubule bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of microtubules, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells. Docetaxel\u2019s binding to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments in the bound microtubules, a feature which differs from most spindle poisons currently in clinical use. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel has been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20 mg/m 2 to 115 mg/m 2 in phase 1 studies. The area under the curve (AUC) was dose proportional following doses of 70 mg/m 2 to 115 mg/m 2 with infusion times of 1 to 2 hours. Docetaxel\u2019s pharmacokinetic profile is consistent with a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model, with initial rapid distribution phase and the late (terminal) phase. Distribution Mean steady state volume of distribution was 113 L. Docetaxel is approximately 94% protein bound in vitro, mainly to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, albumin, and lipoproteins. In three cancer patients, the in vitro binding to plasma proteins was approximately 97%. Dexamethasone does not affect the protein binding of docetaxel. Elimination With extended plasma sampling up to 8 to 22 days post infusion, the estimated mean total body clearance was 18 L/h/m 2 (range of means: 14 to 23) and mean terminal elimination half-life was 116 hours (range of means: 92 to 135). Metabolism Docetaxel is metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme in vitro [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Excretion In three cancer patients urinary and fecal excretion accounted for approximately 6% and 75% of the administered radioactivity, respectively, within 7 days. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in feces was excreted during the first 48 hours as 1 major and 3 minor metabolites with less than 8% as unchanged drug. Specific Populations Effect of Age A population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out after docetaxel treatment of 535 patients dosed at 100 mg/m 2 . Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by this analysis were very close to those estimated from phase 1 studies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was not influenced by age. Effect of Gender The population pharmacokinetics analysis described above also indicated that gender did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Hepatic Impairment The population pharmacokinetic analysis described above indicated that in patients with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver impairment (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN), total body clearance was lowered by an average of 27%, resulting in a 38% increase in systemic exposure (AUC). This average, however, includes a substantial range and there is, at present, no measurement that would allow recommendation for dose adjustment in such patients. Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminase and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with docetaxel injection. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Effect of Race Mean total body clearance for Japanese patients dosed at the range of 10 mg/m 2 to 90 mg/m 2 was similar to that of European/American populations dosed at 100 mg/m 2 , suggesting no significant difference in the elimination of docetaxel in the two populations. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Ketoconazole The effect of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was investigated in 7 cancer patients. Patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel (100 mg/m 2 intravenous) alone or docetaxel (10 mg/m 2 intravenous) in combination with ketoconazole (200 mg orally once daily for 3 days) in a crossover design with a 3-week washout period. The results of this study indicated that the mean dose-normalized AUC of docetaxel was increased 2.2-fold and its clearance was reduced by 49% when docetaxel was coadministered with ketoconazole [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Drug Interactions (7) ] . Effect of Combination Therapies Dexamethasone: Docetaxel total body clearance was not modified by pretreatment with dexamethasone. Cisplatin: Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that previously observed following monotherapy with docetaxel. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin in combination therapy with docetaxel was similar to that observed with cisplatin alone. Cisplatin and Fluorouracil: The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid tumors had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual drug. Prednisone: A population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma data from 40 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer indicated that docetaxel systemic clearance in combination with prednisone is similar to that observed following administration of docetaxel alone. Cyclophosphamide and Doxorubicin: A study was conducted in 30 patients with advanced breast cancer to determine the potential for drug-drug interactions between docetaxel (75 mg/m 2 ), doxorubicin (50 mg/m 2 ), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m 2 ) when administered in combination. The coadministration of docetaxel had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide when the three drugs were given in combination compared to coadministration of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide only. In addition, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide had no effect on docetaxel plasma clearance when the three drugs were given in combination compared to historical data for docetaxel monotherapy."], "manufacturer_name": ["Eugia US LLC"], "substance_name": ["DOCETAXEL ANHYDROUS"], "effective_time": "20240709", "product_ndc": ["55150-378", "55150-379", "55150-380"], "brand_name": ["Docetaxel"]}

A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem I.V. is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa .

{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE Before instituting treatment with ceftriaxone for injection, USP, appropriate specimens should be obtained for isolation of the causative organism and for determination of its susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ceftriaxone for injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, ceftriaxone for injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Ceftriaxone for injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms: Lower Respiratory Tract Infections Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis or Serratia marcescens. Acute Bacterial Otitis Media Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains) or Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains). NOTE: In one study lower clinical cure rates were observed with a single dose of ceftriaxone compared to 10 days of oral therapy. In a second study comparable cure rates were observed between single dose ceftriaxone and the comparator. The potentially lower clinical cure rate of ceftriaxone should be balanced against the potential advantages of parenteral therapy (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). Skin and Skin Structure Infections Caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes , Viridans group streptococci , Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii*, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis* or Peptostreptococcus species. Urinary Tract Infections (complicated and uncomplicated) Caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral and rectal) Caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae , including both penicillinase- and nonpenicillinase-producing strains, and pharyngeal gonorrhea caused by nonpenicillinase-producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Ceftriaxone sodium, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis . Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added. Bacterial Septicemia Caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bone and Joint Infections Caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Enterobacter species. Intra-abdominal Infections Caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium species (Note: most strains of Clostridium difficile are resistant) or Peptostreptococcus species. Meningitis Caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae . Ceftriaxone has also been used successfully in a limited number of cases of meningitis and shunt infection caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis* and Escherichia coli* . *Efficacy for this organism in this organ system was studied in fewer than ten infections. Surgical Prophylaxis The preoperative administration of a single 1 g dose of ceftriaxone may reduce the incidence of postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures classified as contaminated or potentially contaminated (e.g., vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy or cholecystectomy for chronic calculous cholecystitis in high-risk patients, such as those over 70 years of age, with acute cholecystitis not requiring therapeutic antimicrobials, obstructive jaundice or common duct bile stones) and in surgical patients for whom infection at the operative site would present serious risk (e.g., during coronary artery bypass surgery). Although ceftriaxone has been shown to have been as effective as cefazolin in the prevention of infection following coronary artery bypass surgery, no placebo-controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate any cephalosporin antibiotic in the prevention of infection following coronary artery bypass surgery.

Pharmacokinetics in the Middle Ear Fluid In one study, total ceftriaxone concentrations (bound and unbound) were measured in middle ear fluid obtained during the insertion of tympanostomy tubes in 42 pediatric patients with otitis media. Sampling times were from 1 to 50 hours after a single intramuscular injection of 50 mg/kg of ceftriaxone. Mean (\u00b1SD) ceftriaxone levels in the middle ear reached a peak of 35 (\u00b112) mcg/mL at 24 hours, and remained at 19 (\u00b17) mcg/mL at 48 hours. Based on middle ear fluid ceftriaxone concentrations in the 23 to 25 hour and the 46 to 50 hour sampling time intervals, a half-life of 25 hours was calculated. Ceftriaxone is highly bound to plasma proteins. The extent of binding to proteins in the middle ear fluid is unknown. Interaction with Calcium Two in vitro studies, one using adult plasma and the other neonatal plasma from umbilical cord blood have been carried out to assess interaction of ceftriaxone and calcium. Ceftriaxone concentrations up to 1 mM (in excess of concentrations achieved in vivo following administration of 2 grams ceftriaxone infused over 30 minutes) were used in combination with calcium concentrations up to 12 mM (48 mg/dL). Recovery of ceftriaxone from plasma was reduced with calcium concentrations of 6 mM (24 mg/dL) or higher in adult plasma or 4 mM (16 mg/dL) or higher in neonatal plasma. This may be reflective of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitation. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Ceftriaxone is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Ceftriaxone has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Mechanism of Resistance Resistance to ceftriaxone is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability.

An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose. No significant concentrations of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid even in the presence of inflamed meninges. Metabolism In vitro studies in human liver and intestinal microsomes indicated that clindamycin is predominantly metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with minor contribution from CYP3A5, to form clindamycin sulfoxide and a minor metabolite, N-desmethylclindamycin. Excretion Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears from the serum with 6 minutes of the average elimination half-life; however, the average serum elimination half-life of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2\u00bd hours in pediatric patients. Specific Populations Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules do not need to be modified in patients with renal or hepatic disease. Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61\u201379 years) and younger adults (18\u201339 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, the average elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4\u20135.1 h) in the elderly, compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1\u20134.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function 1 . Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients with PMA \u226432 weeks, or >32 to \u226440 weeks Systemic clearance (CL) in premature infants increases with increases in body weight (kg) and post-menstrual age (PMA). The dosing regimens for pediatric patients \u226432 weeks PMA (5 mg/kg) and >32 to \u2264 40 weeks PMA (7 mg/kg), both administered intravenously every 8 hours, achieve exposures comparable to therapeutic exposures in adults (weighing 70 kg) administered clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours (Table 1).

Microbiology Mechanism of Action Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic. Resistance Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B.Macrolide-inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test. Antimicrobial Activity Clindamycin has been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ] : Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pyogenes Anaerobic bacteria Clostridium perfringens Fusobacterium necrophorum Fusobacterium nucleatum Peptostreptococcus anaerobius Prevotella melaninogenica The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for clindamycin against isolates of a similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of clindamycin in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Chemically, sulbactam sodium is sodium penicillinate sulfone; sodium (2S, 5R)-3,3-dimethyl-7-oxo-4-thia-1-azabicyclo [3.2.0] heptane-2-carboxylate 4,4-dioxide. Its chemical formula is C 8 H 10 NNaO 5 S with a molecular weight of 255.22. The structural formula is: UNASYN, ampicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium parenteral combination, is available as a white to off-white dry powder for reconstitution. UNASYN dry powder is freely soluble in aqueous diluents to yield pale yellow to yellow solutions containing ampicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium equivalent to 250 mg ampicillin per mL and 125 mg sulbactam per mL. The pH of the solutions is between 8.0 and 10.0. Dilute solutions (up to 30 mg ampicillin and 15 mg sulbactam per mL) are essentially colorless to pale yellow. The pH of dilute solutions remains the same. Each 1.5 g of UNASYN (1 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 0.5 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) parenteral contains approximately 115 mg (5 mEq) of sodium.

Chemical Structure Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY General Immediately after completion of a 15-minute intravenous infusion of UNASYN, peak serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are attained. Ampicillin serum levels are similar to those produced by the administration of equivalent amounts of ampicillin alone. Peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 109 to 150 mcg/mL are attained after administration of 2000 mg of ampicillin plus 1000 mg sulbactam and 40 to 71 mcg/mL after administration of 1000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam. The corresponding mean peak serum levels for sulbactam range from 48 to 88 mcg/mL and 21 to 40 mcg/mL, respectively. After an intramuscular injection of 1000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam, peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 8 to 37 mcg/mL and peak sulbactam serum levels ranging from 6 to 24 mcg/mL are attained. The mean serum half-life of both drugs is approximately 1 hour in healthy volunteers. Approximately 75 to 85% of both ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted unchanged in the urine during the first 8 hours after administration of UNASYN to individuals with normal renal function. Somewhat higher and more prolonged serum levels of ampicillin and sulbactam can be achieved with the concurrent administration of probenecid. In patients with impaired renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of UNASYN in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). Ampicillin has been found to be approximately 28% reversibly bound to human serum protein and sulbactam approximately 38% reversibly bound. The following average levels of ampicillin and sulbactam were measured in the tissues and fluids listed: TABLE 1 Concentration of UNASYN in Various Body Tissues and Fluids Fluid or Tissue Dose (grams) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Concentration (mcg/mL or mcg/g) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Peritoneal Fluid 0.5/0.5 IV 7/14 Blister Fluid (Cantharides) 0.5/0.5 IV 8/20 Tissue Fluid 1/0.5 IV 8/4 Intestinal Mucosa 0.5/0.5 IV 11/18 Appendix 2/1 IV 3/40 Penetration of both ampicillin and sulbactam into cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of inflamed meninges has been demonstrated after IV administration of UNASYN. The pharmacokinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam in pediatric patients receiving UNASYN are similar to those observed in adults. Immediately after a 15-minute infusion of 50 to 75 mg UNASYN/kg body weight, peak serum and plasma concentrations of 82 to 446 mcg ampicillin/mL and 44 to 203 mcg sulbactam/mL were obtained. Mean half-life values were approximately 1 hour. MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ampicillin is similar to benzyl penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible organisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall mucopeptide biosynthesis. Ampicillin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. (Ampicillin is, however, degraded by beta-lactamases and therefore the spectrum of activity does not normally include organisms which produce these enzymes). A wide range of beta-lactamases found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins have been shown in biochemical studies with cell free bacterial systems to be irreversibly inhibited by sulbactam. Although sulbactam alone possesses little useful antibacterial activity except against the Neisseriaceae , whole organism studies have shown that sulbactam restores ampicillin activity against beta-lactamase producing strains. In particular, sulbactam has good inhibitory activity against the clinically important plasmid mediated beta-lactamases most frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance. Sulbactam has no effect on the activity of ampicillin against ampicillin-susceptible strains. The presence of sulbactam in the UNASYN formulation effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of ampicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to it and to other beta-lactam antibacterials. Thus, UNASYN possesses the properties of a broad-spectrum antibacterial and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Antimicrobial Activity While in vitro studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following organisms, clinical efficacy for infections other than those included in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section has not been documented. Gram-positive Bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Staphylococcus saprophyticus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Enterococcus faecalis These are not beta-lactamase producing strains and, therefore, are susceptible to ampicillin alone.

The loading doses for each of the above indicated groups were 0.5, 0.5, 1 and 2.2 mcg/kg, respectively. Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetic parameters after dexmedetomidine injection maintenance doses of 0.2 to 1.4 mcg/kg/hr for >24 hours were similar to the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters after dexmedetomidine injection maintenance dosing for <24 hours in other studies.

Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of dexmedetomidine was approximately 118 liters. Dexmedetomidine protein binding was assessed in the plasma of normal healthy male and female subjects. The average protein binding was 94% and was constant across the different plasma concentrations tested. Protein binding was similar in males and females. The fraction of dexmedetomidine that was bound to plasma proteins was significantly decreased in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. The potential for protein binding displacement of dexmedetomidine by fentanyl, ketorolac, theophylline, digoxin and lidocaine was explored in vitro , and negligible changes in the plasma protein binding of dexmedetomidine were observed. The potential for protein binding displacement of phenytoin, warfarin, ibuprofen, propranolol, theophylline and digoxin by dexmedetomidine was explored in vitro and none of these compounds appeared to be significantly displaced by dexmedetomidine. Elimination Metabolism Dexmedetomidine undergoes almost complete biotransformation with very little unchanged dexmedetomidine excreted in urine and feces. Biotransformation involves both direct glucuronidation as well as cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism. The major metabolic pathways of dexmedetomidine are: direct N-glucuronidation to inactive metabolites; aliphatic hydroxylation (mediated primarily by CYP2A6 with a minor role of CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19) of dexmedetomidine to generate 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, the glucuronide of 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, and 3-carboxy-dexmedetomidine; and N-methylation of dexmedetomidine to generate 3-hydroxy N-methyl-dexmedetomidine, 3-carboxy N-methyl-dexmedetomidine, and dexmedetomidine-N-methyl O-glucuronide. Excretion The terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of dexmedetomidine is approximately 2 hours and clearance is estimated to be approximately 39 L/h. A mass balance study demonstrated that after nine days an average of 95% of the radioactivity, following intravenous administration of radiolabeled dexmedetomidine, was recovered in the urine and 4% in the feces. No unchanged dexmedetomidine was detected in the urine. Approximately 85% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was excreted within 24 hours after the infusion. Fractionation of the radioactivity excreted in urine demonstrated that products of N-glucuronidation accounted for approximately 34% of the cumulative urinary excretion. In addition, aliphatic hydroxylation of parent drug to form 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, the glucuronide of 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, and 3-carboxylic acid-dexmedetomidine together represented approximately 14% of the dose in urine. N-methylation of dexmedetomidine to form 3-hydroxy N-methyl dexmedetomidine, 3-carboxy N-methyl dexmedetomidine, and N-methyl O-glucuronide dexmedetomidine accounted for approximately 18% of the dose in urine. The N-Methyl metabolite itself was a minor circulating component and was undetected in urine. Approximately 28% of the urinary metabolites have not been identified. Specific Populations Male and Female Patients There was no observed difference in dexmedetomidine injection pharmacokinetics due to gender. Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profile of dexmedetomidine injection was not altered by age. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine injection in young (18\u201340 years), middle age (41\u201365 years), and elderly (>65 years) subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C), clearance values for dexmedetomidine were lower than in healthy subjects. The mean clearance values for patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment were 74%, 64% and 53% of those observed in the normal healthy subjects, respectively. Mean clearances for free drug were 59%, 51% and 32% of those observed in the normal healthy subjects, respectively. Although dexmedetomidine injection is dosed to effect, it may be necessary to consider dose reduction in subjects with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] .

Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework, which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release. The binding of bivalirudin to thrombin is reversible as thrombin slowly cleaves the bivalirudin-Arg 3 -Pro 4 bond, resulting in recovery of thrombin active site functions. In in vitro studies, bivalirudin inhibited both soluble (free) and clot-bound thrombin, was not neutralized by products of the platelet release reaction, and prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin time (PT) of normal human plasma in a concentration-dependent manner. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy volunteers and patients (with \u226570% vessel occlusion undergoing routine PTCA), bivalirudin exhibited dose- and concentration-dependent anticoagulant activity as evidenced by prolongation of the ACT, aPTT, PT, and TT. Intravenous administration of bivalirudin produces an immediate anticoagulant effect. Coagulation times return to baseline approximately 1 hour following cessation of bivalirudin administration. Bivalirudin also increases INR. Therefore, INR measurements made in bivalirudin treated patients may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. In 291 patients with \u226570% vessel occlusion undergoing routine PTCA, a positive correlation was observed between the dose of bivalirudin and the proportion of patients achieving ACT values of 300 sec or 350 sec. At a bivalirudin dose of 1 mg/kg IV bolus plus 2.5 mg/kg/h IV infusion for 4 hours, followed by 0.2 mg/kg/h, all patients reached maximal ACT values greater than 300 sec. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Bivalirudin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics following IV administration to patients undergoing PTCA. In these patients, a mean steady state bivalirudin concentration of 12.3 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL is achieved following an IV bolus of 1 mg/kg and a 4-hour 2.5 mg/kg/h IV infusion. Distribution Bivalirudin does not bind to plasma proteins (other than thrombin) or to red blood cells. Elimination Bivalirudin has a half-life of 25 minutes in PTCA patients with normal renal function. The total body clearance of bivalirudin in PTCA patients with normal renal function is 3.4 mL/min/kg. Metabolism Bivalirudin is metabolized by proteolytic cleavage.

The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours.

Zoledronic acid structural formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The principal pharmacologic action of zoledronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption. Although the antiresorptive mechanism is not completely understood, several factors are thought to contribute to this action. In vitro , zoledronic acid inhibits osteoclastic activity and induces osteoclast apoptosis. Zoledronic acid also blocks the osteoclastic resorption of mineralized bone and cartilage through its binding to bone. Zoledronic acid inhibits the increased osteoclastic activity and skeletal calcium release induced by various stimulatory factors released by tumors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical studies in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) showed that single-dose infusions of zoledronic acid injection are associated with decreases in serum calcium and phosphorus and increases in urinary calcium and phosphorus excretion. Osteoclastic hyperactivity resulting in excessive bone resorption is the underlying pathophysiologic derangement in hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM, tumor-induced hypercalcemia) and metastatic bone disease. Excessive release of calcium into the blood as bone is resorbed results in polyuria and gastrointestinal disturbances, with progressive dehydration and decreasing glomerular filtration rate. This, in turn, results in increased renal resorption of calcium, setting up a cycle of worsening systemic hypercalcemia. Reducing excessive bone resorption and maintaining adequate fluid administration are, therefore, essential to the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy. Patients who have hypercalcemia of malignancy can generally be divided into two groups according to the pathophysiologic mechanism involved: humoral hypercalcemia and hypercalcemia due to tumor invasion of bone. In humoral hypercalcemia, osteoclasts are activated and bone resorption is stimulated by factors such as parathyroid hormone-related protein, which are elaborated by the tumor and circulate systemically. Humoral hypercalcemia usually occurs in squamous cell malignancies of the lung or head and neck or in genitourinary tumors such as renal cell carcinoma or ovarian cancer. Skeletal metastases may be absent or minimal in these patients. Extensive invasion of bone by tumor cells can also result in hypercalcemia due to local tumor products that stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. Tumors commonly associated with locally mediated hypercalcemia include breast cancer and multiple myeloma. Total serum calcium levels in patients who have hypercalcemia of malignancy may not reflect the severity of hypercalcemia, since concomitant hypoalbuminemia is commonly present. Ideally, ionized calcium levels should be used to diagnose and follow hypercalcemic conditions; however, these are not commonly or rapidly available in many clinical situations. Therefore, adjustment of the total serum calcium value for differences in albumin levels (corrected serum calcium, CSC) is often used in place of measurement of ionized calcium; several nomograms are in use for this type of calculation [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic data in patients with hypercalcemia are not available. Distribution Single or multiple (every 28 days) 5-minute or 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 or 16 mg zoledronic acid injection were given to 64 patients with cancer and bone metastases. The post-infusion decline of zoledronic acid concentrations in plasma was consistent with a triphasic process showing a rapid decrease from peak concentrations at end of infusion to less than 1% of C max 24 hours postinfusion with population half-lives of t 1/2\u03b1 0.24 hours and t 1/2\u03b2 1.87 hours for the early disposition phases of the drug. The terminal elimination phase of zoledronic acid was prolonged, with very low concentrations in plasma between Days 2 and 28 postinfusion, and a terminal elimination half-life t 1/2\u03b3 of 146 hours. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC 0-24h ) of zoledronic acid was dose proportional from 2-16 mg. The accumulation of zoledronic acid measured over three cycles was low, with mean AUC 0-24h ratios for cycles 2 and 3 versus 1 of 1.13 \u00b1 0.30 and 1.16 \u00b1 0.36, respectively. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed low affinity of zoledronic acid for the cellular components of human blood, with a mean blood to plasma concentration ratio of 0.59 in a concentration range of 30 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. In vitro , the plasma protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% at 2 ng/mL to 77% at 2000 ng/mL of zoledronic acid. Metabolism Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro . Zoledronic acid does not undergo biotransformation in vivo . In animal studies, less than 3% of the administered intravenous dose was found in the feces, with the balance either recovered in the urine or taken up by bone, indicating that the drug is eliminated intact via the kidney. Following an intravenous dose of 20 nCi 14 C-zoledronic acid in a patient with cancer and bone metastases, only a single radioactive species with chromatographic properties identical to those of parent drug was recovered in urine, which suggests that zoledronic acid is not metabolized. Excretion In 64 patients with cancer and bone metastases, on average (\u00b1 SD) 39 \u00b1 16% of the administered zoledronic acid dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours, with only trace amounts of drug found in urine post-Day 2. The cumulative percent of drug excreted in the urine over 0-24 hours was independent of dose. The balance of drug not recovered in urine over 0-24 hours, representing drug presumably bound to bone, is slowly released back into the systemic circulation, giving rise to the observed prolonged low plasma concentrations. The 0-24 hour renal clearance of zoledronic acid was 3.7 \u00b1 2.0 L/h. Zoledronic acid clearance was independent of dose but dependent upon the patient\u2019s creatinine clearance. In a study in patients with cancer and bone metastases, increasing the infusion time of a 4-mg dose of zoledronic acid from 5 minutes (n = 5) to 15 minutes (n = 7) resulted in a 34% decrease in the zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion ([mean \u00b1 SD] 403 \u00b1 118 ng/mL versus 264 \u00b1 86 ng/mL) and a 10% increase in the total AUC (378 \u00b1 116 ng x h/mL versus 420 \u00b1 218 ng x h/mL). The difference between the AUC means was not statistically significant. Special Populations Pediatrics Zoledronic Acid Injection is not indicated for use in children [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Geriatrics The pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid were not affected by age in patients with cancer and bone metastases who ranged in age from 38 years to 84 years. Race Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not indicate any differences in pharmacokinetics among Japanese and North American (Caucasian and African American) patients with cancer and bone metastases. Hepatic Insufficiency No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. Renal Insufficiency The pharmacokinetic studies conducted in 64 cancer patients represented typical clinical populations with normal to moderately impaired renal function. Compared to patients with normal renal function (N = 37), patients with mild renal impairment (N = 15) showed an average increase in plasma AUC of 15%, whereas patients with moderate renal impairment (N = 11) showed an average increase in plasma AUC of 43%. Limited pharmacokinetic data are available for zoledronic acid injection in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). Based on population PK/PD modeling, the risk of renal deterioration appears to increase with AUC, which is doubled at a creatinine clearance of 10 mL/min. Creatinine clearance is calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula: CrCl = [140-age (years)] x weight (kg) {x 0.85 for female patients} [72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)] Zoledronic Acid Injection systemic clearance in individual patients can be calculated from the population clearance of zoledronic acid injection, CL (L/h)=6.5(CrCl/90) 0.4 . These formulae can be used to predict the zoledronic acid injection AUC in patients, where CL = Dose/AUC 0-\u221e . The average AUC 0-24 in patients with normal renal function was 0.42 mg\u2022h/L and the calculated AUC 0-\u221e for a patient with creatinine clearance of 75 mL/min was 0.66 mg\u2022h/L following a 4-mg dose of zoledronic acid injection.

Its molecular formula is C 21 H 27 NO\u2219HCl and it has a molecular weight of 345.91. Methadone hydrochloride has a melting point of 235\u00b0C, and a pKa of 8.25 in water at 20\u00b0C. Its octanol/water partition coefficient at pH 7.4 is 117. A solution (1:100) in water has a pH between 4.5 and 6.5. Methadone hydrochloride has the following structural formula: Methadone Hydrochloride Injection is a sterile injectable solution available in 20 mL multiple-dose vials. Each mL of the Methadone Hydrochloride Injection contains: 10 mg of methadone hydrochloride (equivalent to 8.95 mg of methadone free base), 5 mg of chlorobutanol, as a preservative, 9 mg of sodium chloride, as tonicity agent, and hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide as pH adjusters, in water for injection. The pH of the sterile injectable solution is between 3.0 to 6.5. Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Methadone hydrochloride is a mu-agonist; a synthetic opioid analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine, the most prominent of which involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. The principal therapeutic uses for methadone are for analgesia and for detoxification or maintenance in opioid addiction. The methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe. Some data also indicate that methadone acts as an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The contribution of NMDA receptor antagonism to methadone's efficacy is unknown. Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Methadone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Methadone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Some NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to produce neurotoxic effects in animals. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Methadone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Methadone produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration\u2013Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of methadone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration\u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing methadone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Methadone Hydrochloride Injection is intended for parenteral (intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular) administration. Methadone pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration have not been systematically studied and differences among the various parenteral routes have not been well characterized. As with many drugs, absorption into the systemic circulation may vary with subcutaneous and intramuscular administration. Distribution Methadone is a lipophilic drug and the steady state volume of distribution ranges between 2 L/kg to 6 L/kg. In plasma, methadone is predominantly bound to \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein (85% to 90%). Methadone is secreted in saliva, breast milk, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord plasma. Elimination Metabolism Methadone is primarily metabolized by N-demethylation to an inactive metabolite, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidene (EDDP). Cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, are responsible for conversion of methadone to EDDP and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted mainly in urine. Excretion Elimination of methadone is mediated by extensive biotransformation, followed by renal and fecal excretion. After single intravenous dose administration the plasma clearance of methadone ranged between 3 L/h to 10 L/h and the terminal half-life (t \u00bd ) ranged between 8 to 59 hours. Methadone has been known to persist in the liver and other tissues. Slow release from the liver and other tissues may prolong the duration of methadone action despite low plasma concentrations. Specific Populations Use During Pregnancy There are no pharmacokinetic studies of parenteral methadone in pregnancy. The disposition of oral methadone has been studied in approximately 30 pregnant patients in 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters. Elimination of methadone was significantly changed in pregnancy. Total body clearance of methadone was increased in pregnant patients compared to the same patients postpartum or to non-pregnant opioid-dependent women. The terminal half-life of methadone is decreased during second and third trimesters. The decrease in plasma half-life and increased clearance of methadone resulting in lower methadone trough levels during pregnancy can lead to withdrawal symptoms in some pregnant patients. The dosage may need to be increased or the dosing interval decreased in pregnant patients receiving methadone (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Impairment Methadone pharmacokinetics have not been extensively evaluated in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Methadone is metabolized in the liver and patients with liver impairment may be at risk of accumulating methadone after multiple dosing. Renal Impairment Methadone pharmacokinetics have not been extensively evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. Unchanged methadone and its metabolites are excreted in urine to a variable degree. Methadone is a basic (pKa = 9.2) compound and the luminal pH of the urinary tract can affect its extraction from plasma. Urine acidification has been shown to increase renal elimination of methadone. Forced diuresis, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been established as beneficial for increasing methadone or metabolite elimination. Sex The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated for sex specificity. Race The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated for race specificity. Age Geriatric Population The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated in geriatric population. Pediatric Population The pharmacokinetics of methadone have not been evaluated in pediatric population. Drug Interaction Studies Cytochrome P450 Interactions Methadone undergoes hepatic N-demethylation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, principally CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. Co-administration of methadone with CYP inducers may result in more rapid metabolism and potential for decreased effects of methadone, whereas administration with CYP inhibitors may reduce metabolism and potentiate methadone's effects. Although antiretroviral drugs such as efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, lopinavir+ritonavir combination are known to inhibit some CYPs, they are shown to reduce the plasma levels of methadone, possibly due to CYP induction activity (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Cytochrome P450 Inducers The following drug interactions were reported following co-administration of methadone with known inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes: Rifampin In patients well-stabilized on methadone, concomitant administration of rifampin resulted in a marked reduction in serum methadone levels and a concurrent appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Phenytoin In a pharmacokinetic study with patients on methadone maintenance therapy, phenytoin administration (250 mg twice daily initially for 1 day followed by 300 mg daily for 3 to 4 days) resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in methadone exposure and withdrawal symptoms occurred concurrently. Upon discontinuation of phenytoin, the incidence of withdrawal symptoms decreased and methadone exposure increased to a level comparable to that prior to phenytoin administration. St. John's Wort, Phenobarbital, Carbamazepine Administration of methadone with other CYP3A4 inducers may result in withdrawal symptoms. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors Voriconazole Voriconazole can inhibit the activity of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Repeat dose administration of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 4 days) increased the peak plasma concentration (C max ) and AUC of (R)-methadone by 31% and 47%, respectively, in subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (30 mg to 100 mg daily. The C max and AUC of (S)-methadone increased by 65% and 103%, respectively. Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during co-administration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Antiretroviral Drugs Although antiretroviral drugs such as efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, telaprevir, lopinavir+ritonavir combination are known to inhibit some CYPs, they are shown to reduce the plasma levels of methadone, possibly due to CYP induction activity. Abacavir, amprenavir, darunavir+ritonavir, efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, telaprevir, lopinavir+ritonavir, saquinavir+ritonavir, tipranvir+ritonavir combination Co-administration of these anti-retroviral agents resulted in increased clearance or decreased plasma levels of methadone (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Didanosine and Stavudine Methadone decreased the AUC and peak levels for didanosine and stavudine, with a more significant decrease for didanosine. Methadone disposition was not substantially altered (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Zidovudine Methadone increased the AUC of zidovudine which could result in toxic effects (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Pregnancy There are no pharmacokinetic studies of parenteral methadone in pregnancy. The disposition of oral methadone has been studied in approximately 30 pregnant patients in 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters. Elimination of methadone was significantly changed in pregnancy.

Fig. 1 - Structural Formula of Insulin Aspart"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including NOVOLOG is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of NOVOLOG After Subcutaneous Administration The pharmacodynamic profile of NOVOLOG given subcutaneously in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes is shown in Figure 2. The maximum glucose-lowering effect of NOVOLOG occurred between 1 and 3 hours after subcutaneous injection (0.15 units/kg). The duration of action for NOVOLOG is 3 to 5 hours. The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs such as NOVOLOG may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual. The parameters of NOVOLOG activity (time of onset, peak time and duration) as designated in Figure 2 should be considered only as general guidelines. The rate of insulin absorption and onset of activity is affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Figure 2. Serial mean serum glucose collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of NOVOLOG (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Pharmacodynamics of NOVOLOG After Intravenous Administration A double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover study in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes demonstrated that intravenous infusion of NOVOLOG resulted in a blood glucose profile that was similar to that after intravenous infusion with regular human insulin. NOVOLOG or human insulin was infused until the patient\u2019s blood glucose decreased to 36 mg/dL, or until the patient demonstrated signs of hypoglycemia (rise in heart rate and onset of sweating), defined as the time of autonomic reaction (R) (see Figure 3). Figure 3. Mean blood glucose profiles following intravenous infusion of NOVOLOG (hatched curve) and regular human insulin (solid curve) in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes. R represents the time of autonomic reaction. Figure 2 Fig. 3 - Pharmacodynamics Graph - Time of Autonomic Reaction 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous administration of NOVOLOG is presented below. Absorption and Bioavailability In studies in healthy volunteers (total n=107) and patients with type 1 diabetes (total n=40), the median time to maximum concentration of NOVOLOG in these trials was 40 to 50 minutes versus 80 to 120 minutes, for regular human insulin respectively. The relative bioavailability of NOVOLOG (0.15 units/kg) compared to regular human insulin indicates that the two insulins are absorbed to a similar extent. In a clinical trial in patients with type 1 diabetes, NOVOLOG and regular human insulin, both administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 units/kg body weight, reached mean maximum concentrations of 82 and 36 mU/L , respectively. Distribution Insulin aspart has a low binding affinity to plasma proteins (<10%), similar to that seen with regular human insulin. Figure 4. Serial mean serum free insulin concentration collected up to 6 hours following a single 0.15 units/kg pre-meal dose of NOVOLOG (solid curve) or regular human insulin (hatched curve) injected immediately before a meal in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes. Metabolism and Elimination In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study 17 healthy Caucasian male subjects between 18 and 40 years of age received an intravenous infusion of either NOVOLOG or regular human insulin at 1.5 mU/kg/min for 120 minutes. The mean insulin clearance was similar for the two groups with mean values of 1.2 L/h/kg for the NOVOLOG group and 1.2 L/h/kg for the regular human insulin group. After subcutaneous administration in normal male volunteers (n=24), NOVOLOG was eliminated with an average apparent half-life of 81 minutes. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients - The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of NOVOLOG and regular human insulin were evaluated in a single dose study in 18 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in 2 age groups: 6-12 years, n=9 and 13-17 years (Tanner grade \u2265 2), n=9. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in both age groups between NOVOLOG and regular human insulin were similar to those in healthy adult subjects and adults with type 1 diabetes. Geriatric Patients : The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of NOVOLOG and regular human insulin were investigated in a single dose study in 18 subjects with type 2 diabetes who were \u2265 65 years of age. The relative differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes between NOVOLOG and regular human insulin were similar to those in younger adults. Male and Female Patients : In healthy volunteers given a single subcutaneous dose of NOVOLOG 0.06 units/kg, no difference in insulin aspart levels was seen between males and females based on comparison of AUC (0-10h) or C max . Obese Patients : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.1 units/kg NOVOLOG was administered in a study of 23 patients with type 1 diabetes and a wide range of body mass index (BMI, 22-39 kg/m 2 ). The pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC and C max , of NOVOLOG were generally unaffected by BMI in the different groups \u2013 BMI 19-23 kg/m 2 (n=4); BMI 23-27 kg/m 2 (n=7); BMI 27-32 kg/m 2 (n=6) and BMI >32 kg/m 2 (n=6). Clearance of NOVOLOG was reduced by 28% in patients with BMI >32 kg/m 2 compared to patients with BMI <23 kg/m 2 . Patients with Renal Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.08 units/kg NOVOLOG was administered in a study to subjects with either normal renal function (n=6) creatinine clearance (CLcr) (> 80 ml/min) or mild (n=7; CLcr = 50-80 ml/min), moderate (n=3; CLcr = 30-50 ml/min) or severe (but not requiring hemodialysis) (n=2; CLcr = <30 ml/min) renal impairment. In this study, there was no apparent effect of creatinine clearance values on AUC and C max of NOVOLOG. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : A single subcutaneous dose of 0.06 units/kg NOVOLOG was administered in an open-label, single-dose study of 24 subjects (n=6/group) with different degree of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate and severe) having Child-Pugh Scores ranging from 0 (healthy volunteers) to 12 (severe hepatic impairment). In this study, there was no correlation between the degree of hepatic impairment and any NOVOLOG pharmacokinetic parameter.

Cardiac output is generally unaffected, although it can be decreased, and total peripheral resistance is also elevated. The elevation in resistance and pressure result in reflex vagal activity, which slows the heart rate and increases stroke volume. The elevation in vascular tone or resistance reduces blood flow to the major abdominal organs as well as to skeletal muscle. Coronary blood flow is substantially increased secondary to the indirect effects of alpha stimulation. After intravenous administration, a pressor response occurs rapidly and reaches steady state within 5 minutes. The pharmacologic actions of norepinephrine are terminated primarily by uptake and metabolism in sympathetic nerve endings. The pressor action stops within 1-2 minutes after the infusion is discontinued. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following initiation of intravenous infusion, the steady state plasma concentration is achieved in 5 min. Distribution Plasma protein binding of norepinephrine is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to plasma albumin and to a smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution is 8.8 L. Norepinephrine localizes mainly in sympathetic nervous tissue. It crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The mean half-life of norepinephrine is approximately 2.4 min. The average metabolic clearance is 3.1 L/min.

Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron HCl injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron HCl in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1 SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron HCl injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42 \u00b1 34%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron HCl injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1 SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110 \u00b1 45%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron HCl injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067 \u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (C T ) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4 . The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Co-administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron HCl injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron HCl injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."], "manufacturer_name": ["Delpharm Boucherville Canada Inc."], "substance_name": ["PALONOSETRON HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240313", "product_ndc": ["82650-144"], "brand_name": ["Palonosetron Hydrochloride"]}

When administered intravenously, tirofiban hydrochloride injection inhibits ex vivo platelet aggregation in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. When given according to the PRISM-PLUS regimen of 0.4 mcg/kg/min over 30 minutes followed by a 0.1 mcg/kg/min maintenance infusion, > 90% inhibition of platelet aggregation is attained by the end of the 30-minute infusion. When given according to the recommended regimen of 25 mcg/kg followed by a 0.15 mcg/kg/min maintenance infusion, > 90% inhibition of platelet aggregation is attained within 10 minutes. Platelet aggregation inhibition is reversible following cessation of the infusion of tirofiban hydrochloride injection. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tirofiban hydrochloride injection inhibits platelet function, as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit ex vivo adenosine phosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time in healthy subjects and patients with coronary artery disease. The time course of inhibition parallels the plasma concentration profile of the drug. Following discontinuation of an infusion of tirofiban hydrochloride injection 0.10 mcg/kg/min, ex vivo platelet aggregation returns to near baseline in 4 to 8 hours in approximately 90% of patients with coronary artery disease. The addition of heparin to this regimen does not significantly alter the percentage of subjects with > 70% inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA), but does increase the average bleeding time, as well as the number of patients with bleeding times prolonged to > 30 minutes. Similar platelet aggregation recovery rates are observed following discontinuation of a 0.15 mcg/kg/min infusion. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tirofiban has a half-life of approximately 2 hours. It is cleared from the plasma largely by renal excretion, with about 65% of an administered dose appearing in urine and about 25% in feces, both largely as unchanged tirofiban. Metabolism appears to be limited. Tirofiban is not highly bound to plasma proteins and protein binding is concentration independent over the range of 0.01 to 25 mcg/mL. The unbound fraction in human plasma is 35%. The steady state volume of distribution of tirofiban ranges from 22 to 42 liters. In healthy subjects, the plasma clearance of tirofiban ranges from 213 to 314 mL/min. Renal clearance accounts for 39 to 69% of plasma clearance.

Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY After an intravenous infusion of penicillin G, peak serum concentrations are attained immediately after completion of the infusion. In a study of ten patients administered a single 5 million unit dose of penicillin G intravenously over 3 to 5 minutes, the mean serum concentrations were 400 mcg/mL, 273 mcg/mL and 3 mcg/mL at 5 to 6 minutes, 10 minutes and 4 hours after completion of the injection, respectively. In a separate study, five healthy adults were administered one million units of penicillin G intravenously, either as a bolus over 4 minutes or as an infusion over 60 minutes. The mean serum concentration eight minutes after completion of the bolus was 45 mcg/mL and eight minutes after completion of the infusion was 14.4 mcg/mL. The mean \u03b2-phase serum half-life of penicillin G administered by the intravenous route in ten patients with normal renal function was 42 minutes, with a range of 31 to 50 minutes. The clearance of penicillin G in normal individuals is predominantly via the kidney. The renal clearance, which is extremely rapid, is the result of glomerular filtration and active tubular transport, with the latter route predominating. Urinary recovery is reported to be 58 to 85% of the administered dose. Renal clearance of penicillin is delayed in premature infants, neonates and in the elderly due to decreased renal function. The serum half-life of penicillin G correlates inversely with age and clearance of creatinine and ranges from 3.2 hours in infants 0 to 6 days of age to 1.4 hours in infants 14 days of age or older. Nonrenal clearance includes hepatic metabolism and, to a lesser extent, biliary excretion. The latter routes become more important with renal impairment. Probenecid blocks the renal tubular secretion of penicillin. Therefore, the concurrent administration of probenecid prolongs the elimination of penicillin G and, consequently, increases the serum concentrations. Penicillin G is distributed to most areas of the body including lung, liver, kidney, muscle, bone and placenta. In the presence of inflammation, levels of penicillin in abscesses, middle ear, pleural, peritoneal and synovial fluids are sufficient to inhibit most susceptible bacteria. Penetration into the eye, brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or prostate is poor in the absence of inflammation. With inflamed meninges, the penetration of penicillin G into the CSF improves, such that the CSF/serum ratio is 2 to 6%. Inflammation also enhances its penetration into the pericardial fluid. Penicillin G is actively secreted into the bile resulting in levels at least 10 times those achieved simultaneously in serum. Penicillin G penetrates poorly into human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In the presence of impaired renal function, the \u03b2-phase serum half-life of penicillin G is prolonged. \u03b2-phase serum half-lives of one to two hours were observed in azotemic patients with serum creatinine concentrations <3 mg/100 mL and ranged as high as 20 hours in anuric patients. A linear relationship, including the lowest range of renal function, is found between the serum elimination rate constant and renal function as measured by creatinine clearance. In patients with altered renal function, the presence of hepatic insufficiency further alters the elimination of penicillin G. In one study, the serum half-lives in two anuric patients (excreting <400 mL urine/day) were 7.2 and 10.1 hours. A totally anuric patient with terminal hepatic cirrhosis had a penicillin half-life of 30.5 hours, while another patient with anuria and liver disease had a serum half-life of 16.4 hours. The dosage of penicillin G should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment, with additional modifications when hepatic disease accompanies the renal impairment. Hemodialysis has been shown to reduce penicillin G serum levels. Microbiology Penicillin G is bactericidal against penicillin-susceptible microorganisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts by inhibiting biosynthesis of cell-wall mucopeptide. It is not active against the penicillinase-producing bacteria, which include many strains of staphylococci. Penicillin G is highly active in vitro against staphylococci (except penicillinase-producing strains), streptococci (groups A, B, C, G, H, L and M), pneumococci and Neisseria meningitidis . Other organisms susceptible in vitro to penicillin G are Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Bacillus anthracis , clostridia, Actinomyces species, Spirillum minus, Streptobacillus moniliformis, Listeria monocytogenes , and leptospira; Treponema pallidum is extremely susceptible. Some species of gram-negative bacilli were previously considered susceptible to very high intravenous doses of penicillin G (up to 80 million units/day) including some strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis , salmonella, shigella, Enterobacter aerogenes (formerly Aerobacter aerogenes ) and Alcaligenes faecalis .

Stimulation of the \u03b1-adrenergic receptors of smooth muscle cells in the bladder base may increase the resistance to the outflow of urine. Activation of \u03b2- adrenergic receptors in the lungs promotes bronchodilation. The overall cardiovascular effect from ephedrine is the result of a balance among \u03b1-1 adrenoceptor- mediated vasoconstriction, \u03b2-2 adrenoceptor- mediated vasoconstriction, and \u03b2-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation. Stimulation of the \u03b2-1 adrenoceptors results in positive inotrope and chronotrope action. Tachyphylaxis to the pressor effects of ephedrine may occur with repeated administration [ see Warnings and Precautions 5.2 ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Publications studying pharmacokinetics of oral administration of (-)-ephedrine support that (-)-ephedrine is metabolized into norephedrine. However, the metabolism pathway is unknown. Both the parent drug and the metabolite are excreted in urine. Limited data after IV administration of ephedrine support similar observations of urinary excretion of drug and metabolite.

In in vitro and in vivo studies amivantamab-vmjw was able to disrupt EGFR and MET signaling functions in mutation models of exon 19 deletions, exon 21 L858R substitutions, and exon 20 insertions through blocking ligand binding or degradation of EGFR and MET. The presence of EGFR and MET on the surface of tumor cells also allows for targeting of these cells for destruction by immune effector cells, such as natural killer cells and macrophages, through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and trogocytosis mechanisms, respectively. Treatment with amivantamab in combination with lazertinib increased in vivo anti-tumor activity compared to either agent alone in a mouse xenograft model of human NSCLC with an EGFR L858R mutation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time-course of pharmacodynamic response of amivantamab-vmjw have not been fully characterized in patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Amivantamab-vmjw exposures increased proportionally over a dosage range from 350 to 1,750 mg (0.33 to 1.7 times the lowest approved recommended dosage) when RYBREVANT was administered as a single agent. Steady-state concentrations of RYBREVANT were reached by week 13 for both the 3-week and 2-week dosing regimen and the systemic accumulation was 1.9-fold. Distribution The amivantamab-vmjw mean (%CV) volume of distribution is 5 (24%) L. Elimination The mean (% CV) linear clearance (CL) is 0.26 L/day (30%) and mean terminal half-life is 14 days (33%). Specific Populations No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of amivantamab-vmjw were observed based on age (range: 21\u201388 years), body weight (31 to 140 kg), sex, race (White, Asian or Black or African American) and ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino or not Hispanic/Latino), mild or moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min) or mild hepatic impairment [(total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN) or (ULN < total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times ULN)]. The effect of severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min), end-stage renal disease (eGFR < 15 mL/min) or moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 times ULN and any AST) on amivantamab-vmjw pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Body Weight Increases in body weight increased the volume of distribution and clearance of amivantamab-vmjw. Amivantamab-vmjw exposures are 30 to 40% lower in patients who weighed \u2265 80 kg compared to patients with body weight < 80 kg at the same dose.

Its mode of action is unclear. It seems to sensitize tissues to the action of acetylcholine. The effect of metoclopramide on motility is not dependent on intact vagal innervation, but it can be abolished by anticholinergic drugs. Metoclopramide increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder. In patients with gastroesophageal reflux and low LESP (lower esophageal sphincter pressure), single oral doses of metoclopramide produce dose-related increases in LESP. Effects begin at about 5 mg and increase through 20 mg (the largest dose tested). The increase in LESP from a 5 mg dose lasts about 45 minutes and that of 20 mg lasts between 2 and 3 hours. Increased rate of stomach emptying has been observed with single oral doses of 10 mg. The antiemetic properties of metoclopramide appear to be a result of its antagonism of central and peripheral dopamine receptors. Dopamine produces nausea and vomiting by stimulation of the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and metoclopramide blocks stimulation of the CTZ by agents like l\u2011dopa or apomorphine which are known to increase dopamine levels or to possess dopamine-like effects. Metoclopramide also abolishes the slowing of gastric emptying caused by apomorphine. Like the phenothiazines and related drugs, which are also dopamine antagonists, metoclopramide produces sedation and may produce extrapyramidal reactions, although these are comparatively rare (see WARNINGS ). Metoclopramide inhibits the central and peripheral effects of apomorphine, induces release of prolactin and causes a transient increase in circulating aldosterone levels, which may be associated with transient fluid retention. The onset of pharmacological action of metoclopramide is 1 to 3 minutes following an intravenous dose, 10 to 15 minutes following intramuscular administration, and 30 to 60 minutes following an oral dose, pharmacological effects persist for 1 to 2 hours. Pharmacokinetics Metoclopramide is rapidly and well absorbed. Relative to an intravenous dose of 20 mg, the absolute oral bioavailability of metoclopramide is 80% \u00b1 15.5% as demonstrated in a crossover study of 18 subjects. Peak plasma concentrations occur at about 1 to 2 hours after a single oral dose. Similar time to peak is observed after individual doses at steady state. In a single-dose study of 12 subjects, the area under the drug concentration-time curve increases linearly with doses from 20 to 100 mg. Peak concentrations increase linearly with dose; time to peak concentrations remains the same; whole body clearance is unchanged; and the elimination rate remains the same. The average elimination half-life in individuals with normal renal function is 5 to 6 hours. Linear kinetic processes adequately describe the absorption and elimination of metoclopramide. Approximately 85% of the radioactivity of an orally administered dose appears in the urine within 72 hours. Of the 85% eliminated in the urine, about half is present as free or conjugated metoclopramide. The drug is not extensively bound to plasma proteins (about 30%). The whole body volume of distribution is high (about 3.5 L/kg) which suggests extensive distribution of drug to the tissues. Renal impairment affects the clearance of metoclopramide. In a study with patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, a reduction in creatinine clearance was correlated with a reduction in plasma clearance, renal clearance, non-renal clearance, and increase in elimination half-life. The kinetics of metoclopramide in the presence of renal impairment remained linear however. The reduction in clearance as a result of renal impairment suggests that adjustment downward of maintenance dosage should be done to avoid drug accumulation. Adult Pharmacokinetic Data Parameter Value Vd (L/kg) ~3.5 Plasma Protein Binding ~30% t 1/2 (hr) 5 to 6 Oral Bioavailability 80% \u00b1 15.5% In pediatric patients, the pharmacodynamics of metoclopramide following oral and intravenous administration are highly variable and a concentration-effect relationship has not been established. There are insufficient reliable data to conclude whether the pharmacokinetics of metoclopramide in adults and the pediatric population are similar. Although there are insufficient data to support the efficacy of metoclopramide in pediatric patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or cancer chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting, its pharmacokinetics have been studied in these patient populations. In an open-label study, six pediatric patients (age range, 3.5 weeks to 5.4 months) with GER received metoclopramide 0.15 mg/kg oral solution every 6 hours for 10 doses. The mean peak plasma concentration of metoclopramide after the tenth dose was 2-fold (56.8 mcg/L) higher compared to that observed after the first dose (29 mcg/L) indicating drug accumulation with repeated dosing. After the tenth dose, the mean time to reach peak concentrations (2.2 hrs), half-life (4.1 hrs), clearance (0.67 L/h/kg), and volume of distribution (4.4 L/kg) of metoclopramide were similar to those observed after the first dose. In the youngest patient (age, 3.5 weeks), metoclopramide half-life after the first and the tenth dose (23.1 and 10.3 hrs, respectively) was significantly longer compared to other infants due to reduced clearance. This may be attributed to immature hepatic and renal systems at birth. Single intravenous doses of metoclopramide 0.22 to 0.46 mg/kg (mean, 0.35 mg/kg) were administered over 5 minutes to nine pediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy (mean age, 11.7 years; range, 7 to 14 yrs) for prophylaxis of cytotoxic-induced vomiting. The metoclopramide plasma concentrations extrapolated to time zero ranged from 65 to 395 mcg/L (mean, 152 mcg/L). The mean elimination half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution of metoclopramide were 4.4 hrs (range, 1.7 to 8.3 hrs), 0.56 L/h/kg (range, 0.12 to 1.20 L/h/kg), and 3.0 L/kg (range, 1.0 to 4.8 L/kg), respectively. In another study, nine pediatric cancer patients (age range, 1 to 9 yrs) received 4 to 5 intravenous infusions (over 30 minutes) of metoclopramide at a dose of 2 mg/kg to control emesis. After the last dose, the peak serum concentrations of metoclopramide ranged from 1060 to 5680 mcg/L. The mean elimination half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution of metoclopramide were 4.5 hrs (range, 2.0 to 12.5 hrs), 0.37 L/h/kg (range, 0.10 to 1.24 L/h/kg), and 1.93 L/kg (range, 0.95 to 5.50 L/kg), respectively.

Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Pemetrexed is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor that disrupts folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. In vitro studies show that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is taken into cells by membrane carriers such as the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pemetrexed inhibited the in vitro growth of mesothelioma cell lines (MSTO-211H, NCI-H2052) and showed synergistic effects when combined with cisplatin. Based on population pharmacodynamic analyses, the depth of the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) nadir correlates with the systemic exposure to pemetrexed and supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B 12 . There is no cumulative effect of pemetrexed exposure on ANC nadir over multiple treatment cycles. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed when pemetrexed was administered as a single agent in doses ranging from 0.2 to 838 mg/m 2 infused over a 10-minute period have been evaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumors. Pemetrexed total systemic exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C max ) increased proportionally with increase of dose. The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed did not change over multiple treatment cycles. Distribution Pemetrexed has a steady-state volume of distribution of 16.1 liters. In vitro studies indicated that pemetrexed is 81% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination The total systemic clearance of pemetrexed is 91.8 mL/min and the elimination half-life of pemetrexed is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90 mL/min). As renal function decreases, the clearance of pemetrexed decreases and exposure (AUC) of pemetrexed increases. Metabolism Pemetrexed is not metabolized to an appreciable extent. Excretion Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70% to 90% of the dose recovered unchanged within the first 24 hours following administration. In vitro studies indicated that pemetrexed is a substrate of OAT3 (organic anion transporter 3), a transporter that is involved in the active secretion of pemetrexed. Specific Populations Age (26 to 80 years) and sex had no clinically meaningful effect on the systemic exposure of pemetrexed based on population pharmacokinetic analyses. Racial Groups The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed were similar in Whites and Blacks or African Americans. Insufficient data are available for other ethnic groups. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Pemetrexed has not been formally studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No effect of elevated AST, ALT, or total bilirubin on the PK of pemetrexed was observed in clinical studies. Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic analyses of pemetrexed included 127 patients with impaired renal function. Plasma clearance of pemetrexed decreases as renal function decreases, with a resultant increase in systemic exposure. Patients with creatinine clearances of 45, 50, and 80 mL/min had 65%, 54%, and 13% increases, respectively in systemic exposure (AUC) compared to patients with creatinine clearance of 100 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Third-Space Fluid The pemetrexed plasma concentrations in patients with various solid tumors with stable, mild to moderate third-space fluid were comparable to those observed in patients without third space fluid collections. The effect of severe third space fluid on pharmacokinetics is not known. Drug Interaction Studies Drugs Inhibiting OAT3 Transporter Ibuprofen, an OAT3 inhibitor, administered at 400 mg four times a day decreased the clearance of pemetrexed and increased its exposure (AUC) by approximately 20% in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance >80 mL/min). In Vitro Studies Pemetrexed is a substrate for OAT3. Ibuprofen, an OAT3 inhibitor inhibited the uptake of pemetrexed in OAT3-expressing cell cultures with an average [l \u00b5 ]/lC 50 ratio of 0.38. In vitro data predict that at clinically relevant concentrations, other NSAIDs (naproxen, diclofenac, celecoxib) would not inhibit the uptake of pemetrexed by OAT3 and would not increase the AUC of pemetrexed to a clinically significant extent. [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Pemetrexed is a substrate for OAT4. In vitro, ibuprofen and other NSAIDs (naproxen, diclofenac, celecoxib) are not inhibitors of OAT4 at clinically relevant concentrations. Aspirin Aspirin, administered in low to moderate doses (325 mg every 6 hours), does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed.

Docetaxel (anhydrous) has the following structural formula: Docetaxel is a white to almost-white, crystalline powder with an empirical formula of C 43 H 53 NO 14 and a molecular weight of 807.88. It is highly lipophilic and practically insoluble in water. Docetaxel Injection, USP is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, clear, colorless to pale yellow solution at 10 mg/mL concentration.

Docetaxel Injection requires NO prior dilution with a diluent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. Docetaxel-Injection-SPL-Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells that is essential for mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel binds to free tubulin and promotes the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly. This leads to the production of microtubule bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of microtubules, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells. Docetaxel\u2019s binding to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments in the bound microtubules, a feature which differs from most spindle poisons currently in clinical use. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel has been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20 mg/m 2 to 115 mg/m 2 in phase 1 studies. The area under the curve (AUC) was dose proportional following doses of 70 mg/m 2 to 115 mg/m 2 with infusion times of 1 to 2 hours. Docetaxel\u2019s pharmacokinetic profile is consistent with a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model, with initial rapid distribution phase and the late (terminal) phase. Distribution Mean steady state volume of distribution was 113 L. Docetaxel is approximately 94% protein bound in vitro , mainly to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, albumin, and lipoproteins. In three cancer patients, the in vitro binding to plasma proteins was approximately 97%. Dexamethasone does not affect the protein binding of docetaxel. Elimination With extended plasma sampling up to 8 to 22 days post infusion, the estimated mean total body clearance was 18 L/h/m 2 (range of means: 14 to 23) and mean terminal elimination half-life was 116 hours (range of means: 92 to 135). Metabolism Docetaxel is metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme in vitro [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Excretion In three cancer patients urinary and fecal excretion accounted for approximately 6% and 75% of the administered radioactivity, respectively, within 7 days. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in feces was excreted during the first 48 hours as 1 major and 3 minor metabolites with less than 8% as unchanged drug. Specific Populations Effect of Age A population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out after docetaxel treatment of 535 patients dosed at 100 mg/m 2 . Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by this analysis were very close to those estimated from phase 1 studies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was not influenced by age. Effect of Gender The population pharmacokinetics analysis described above also indicated that gender did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Hepatic Impairment The population pharmacokinetic analysis described above indicated that in patients with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver impairment (AST and/or ALT>1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN), total body clearance was lowered by an average of 27%, resulting in a 38% increase in systemic exposure (AUC). This average, however, includes a substantial range and there is, at present, no measurement that would allow recommendation for dose adjustment in such patients. Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminase and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied . [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Effect of Race Mean total body clearance for Japanese patients dosed at the range of 10 mg/m 2 to 90 mg/m 2 was similar to that of European/American populations dosed at 100 mg/m 2 , suggesting no significant difference in the elimination of docetaxel in the two populations. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Ketoconazole The effect of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was investigated in 7 cancer patients. Patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel (100 mg/m 2 intravenous) alone or docetaxel (10 mg/m 2 intravenous) in combination with ketoconazole (200 mg orally once daily for 3 days) in a crossover design with a 3-week washout period. The results of this study indicated that the mean dose-normalized AUC of docetaxel was increased 2.2-fold and its clearance was reduced by 49% when docetaxel was coadministered with ketoconazole [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Effect of Combination Therapies Dexamethasone: Docetaxel total body clearance was not modified by pretreatment with dexamethasone. Cisplatin: Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that previously observed following monotherapy with docetaxel. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin in combination therapy with docetaxel was similar to that observed with cisplatin alone. Cisplatin and Fluorouracil: The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid tumors had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual drug. Prednisone: A population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma data from 40 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer indicated that docetaxel systemic clearance in combination with prednisone is similar to that observed following administration of docetaxel alone. Cyclophosphamide and Doxorubicin: A study was conducted in 30 patients with advanced breast cancer to determine the potential for drug-drug interactions between docetaxel (75 mg/m 2 ), doxorubicin (50 mg/m 2 ), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m 2 ) when administered in combination. The coadministration of docetaxel had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide when the three drugs were given in combination compared to coadministration of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide only. In addition, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide had no effect on docetaxel plasma clearance when the three drugs were given in combination compared to historical data for docetaxel monotherapy."], "manufacturer_name": ["Gland Pharma Limited"], "substance_name": ["DOCETAXEL ANHYDROUS"], "effective_time": "20230616", "product_ndc": ["68083-399", "68083-400", "68083-401"], "brand_name": ["Docetaxel"]}

The major circulating metabolite of ketamine (norketamine) demonstrated activity at the same receptor with less affinity. Norketamine is about 1/3 as active as ketamine in reducing halothane requirements (MAC) of the rat. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Nervous System Ketamine is a rapidly-acting general anesthetic producing a dissociative anesthetic state characterized by profound analgesia, normal pharyngeal-laryngeal reflexes, normal or slightly enhanced skeletal muscle tone, cardiovascular and respiratory stimulation, and occasionally a transient and minimal respiratory depression. The mechanism of action is primarily due to antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA receptors) in the central nervous system. Ketamine can produce nystagmus with pupillary dilation, salivation, lacrimation, and spontaneous limb movements with increased muscle tone through indirect sympathomimetic activity. Ketamine produces analgesia. Ketamine-induced emergence delirium can be reduced with benzodiazepines. Cardiovascular System Ketamine increases blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output. Cardiovascular effects of ketamine are indirect and believed to be mediated by inhibition of both central and peripheral catecholamine reuptake. Elevation of blood pressure reaches a maximum within a few minutes of injection and usually returns to preanesthetic values within 15 minutes. In the majority of cases, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure peaks from 10% to 50% above preanesthetic levels shortly after induction of anesthesia, but the elevation can be higher or longer in individual cases. Respiratory System Ketamine is a potent bronchodilator suitable for anesthetizing patients at high risk for bronchospasm. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Following intravenous administration, the ketamine concentration has an initial slope (alpha phase) lasting about 45 minutes with a half-life of 10 to 15 minutes. This first phase corresponds clinically to the anesthetic effect of the drug. Elimination Metabolism Ketamine is metabolized via N-dealkylation to the active metabolite norketamine primarily by CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by other CYP enzymes. Norketamine undergoes hydroxylation of the cyclohexone ring to form hydroxynorketamine compounds via CYP-dependent pathways, which are conjugated with glucuronic acid and subsequently undergo dehydration of the hydroxylated metabolites to form the cyclohexene derivative dehydroxynorketamine. Excretion Following intravenous administration, the ketamine concentration decreases due to a combination of redistribution from the CNS to slower equilibrating peripheral tissues and hepatic biotransformation to norketamine. The redistribution half-life of ketamine from the CNS to slower equilibrating peripheral tissues (beta phase) is 2.5 hours."], "manufacturer_name": ["Endo USA, Inc."], "substance_name": ["KETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20220330", "product_ndc": ["42023-113", "42023-114", "42023-115"], "brand_name": ["Ketalar"]}

Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients.

The response to Desmopressin Acetate Injection of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent of initial concentrations obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg body weight. The increase is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The factor VIII related antigen and ristocetin cofactor activity were also increased to a smaller degree, but still are dose-dependent. 1.

As a result, Desmopressin Acetate Injection provides a prompt onset of antidiuretic action with a long duration after each administration. 2. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to Desmopressin Acetate Injection has resulted in a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 3. When administered by injection, Desmopressin Acetate Injection has an antidiuretic effect about ten times that of an equivalent dose administered intranasally. 4.

In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor added to bupivacaine to slow absorption into the general circulation and thus prolong maintenance of an active tissue concentration. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic absorption of bupivacaine produces effects on the cardiovascular system and CNS. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. These cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Following systemic absorption, bupivacaine can produce CNS stimulation, CNS depression, or both. Apparent central stimulation is manifested as restlessness, tremors, and shivering, progressing to convulsions, followed by CNS depression and coma progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest. However, bupivacaine has a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited state. The duration of local anesthesia after administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is longer than that observed after administration of other commonly used short-acting local anesthetics. There appears to be period of analgesia that persists after the resolution of the block and return of sensation. The onset of action following dental injections is usually 2 to 10 minutes and may last up to 7 hours. The duration of anesthetic effect is prolonged by the addition of epinephrine 1:200,000. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection do not correlate with local efficacy. Absorption The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000) usually reduces the rate of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine, permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and sometimes prolonging the duration of action [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After injection of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next three to six hours. Distribution Bupivacaine appears to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of bupivacaine appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity (95%) has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4). The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, bupivacaine is distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profile of bupivacaine after direct intravenous injection (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection is not approved for intravenous use) suggest a three-compartment open model. The first compartment is represented by the rapid intravascular distribution of the drug. The second compartment represents the equilibration of the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as the brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and liver. The third compartment represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly perfused tissues, such as muscle and fat. Elimination The half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours. Metabolism Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine. The elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely upon the availability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized. Excretion The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Elderly patients exhibited higher peak plasma concentrations than younger patients following administration of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection. The total plasma clearance was decreased in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic disease. Patients with hepatic disease, especially those with severe hepatic disease, may be more susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local anesthetics [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of renal disease, factors affecting urinary pH, and renal blood flow [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.7) ] .", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt retaining properties, are used in replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are used primarily for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lidocaine hydrochloride stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hemodynamics Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine hydrochloride is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine hydrochloride is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine hydrochloride crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine hydrochloride. Approximately 90% of lidocaine hydrochloride administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine hydrochloride following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine hydrochloride required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.", "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl\u203e) ions. These ions are normal constituents of the body fluids (principally extracellular) and are essential for maintaining electrolyte balance.

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro . Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following twice weekly administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 bortezomib doses, the maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (relative to baseline) in whole blood was observed five minutes after drug administration. Comparable maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was observed between 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses. Maximal inhibition ranged from 70% to 84% and from 73% to 83% for the 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 dose regimens, respectively. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses, the mean maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib (C max ) after the first dose (Day 1) were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively. When administered twice weekly, the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m 2 dose to patients with multiple myeloma, the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC last ) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The AUC last geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) was 0.99 (0.80 to 1.23). The C max after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/mL) was lower than after intravenous administration (223 ng/mL) with repeat dose administration. Distribution The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 L/m 2 following single- or repeat-dose administration of 1 mg/m 2 or 1.3 mg/m 2 to patients with multiple myeloma. The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively. Metabolism Bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized to several inactive metabolites in vitro via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. Excretion The pathways of elimination of bortezomib have not been characterized in humans. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were observed based on age, sex, or renal impairment (including patients administered VELCADE after dialysis). The effect of race on bortezomib pharmacokinetics is unknown.

Slow I.V. administration of 500 mg gives a peak serum level of 43 mcg/mL after 5 minutes with a half-life of 20 to 30 minutes. Oxacillin sodium, with normal doses, has insignificant concentrations in the cerebrospinal and ascitic fluids. It is found in therapeutic concentrations in the pleural, bile, and amniotic fluids. Oxacillin Sodium is rapidly excreted as unchanged drug in the urine by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. The elimination half-life for oxacillin is about 0.5 hours. Nonrenal elimination includes hepatic inactivation and excretion in bile. Oxacillin sodium binds to serum protein, mainly albumin. The degree of protein binding reported varies with the method of study and the investigator, but generally has been found to be 94.2 \u00b1 2.1%. Probenecid blocks the renal tubular secretion of penicillins. Therefore, the concurrent administration of probenecid prolongs the elimination of oxacillin and, consequently, increases the serum concentration. Intravenous injection gives a peak about 5 minutes after the injection is completed. Slow I.V. dosing with 500 mg gives a 5 minute peak of 43 mcg/mL with a half-life of 20 to 30 minutes. Microbiology Mode of Action Penicillinase-resistant penicillins exert a bactericidal action against penicillin susceptible microorganisms during the state of active multiplication. All penicillins inhibit the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Mechanism of Resistance Resistance to penicillins may be mediated by destruction of the beta-lactam ring by a beta-lactamase, altered affinity of penicillin for target, or decreased penetration of the antibiotic to reach the target site. Cross Resistance Resistance to oxacillin (or cefoxitin) implies resistance to all other beta-lactam agents, except newer agents with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus .

Triiodothyronine (T 3 ) and levothyroxine (T 4 ) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T 3 , the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T 4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion is regulated by the hypothalamic pituitary-thyroid axis. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) released from the hypothalamus stimulates secretion of thyrotropin stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary. TSH, in turn, is the physiologic stimulus for the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones, T 4 and T 3 , by the thyroid gland. Circulating serum T 3 and T 4 levels exert a feedback effect on both TRH and TSH secretion. When serum T 3 and T 4 levels increase, TRH and TSH secretion decrease. When thyroid hormone levels decrease, TRH and TSH secretion increases. TSH is used for the diagnosis of hypothyroidism and evaluation of levothyroxine therapy adequacy with other laboratory and clinical data [see Dosage ( 2.1 )]. There are drugs known to affect thyroid hormones and TSH by various mechanisms and those examples are diazepam, ethioamide, lovastatin, metoclopramide, 6-mercaptopurine, nitroprusside, perphenazine, and thiazide diuretics. Some drugs may cause a transient decrease in TSH secretion without hypothyroidism and those drugs (dose) are dopamine (greater than 1 mcg per kg per min), glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone greater than 100 mg per day or equivalent) and octreotide (greater than 100 mcg per day). Thyroid hormones regulate multiple metabolic processes and play an essential role in normal growth and development, and normal maturation of the central nervous system and bone. The metabolic actions of thyroid hormones include augmentation of cellular respiration and thermogenesis, as well as metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. The protein anabolic effects of thyroid hormones are essential to normal growth and development. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption \u2013 Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection is administered via the intravenous route. Following administration, the synthetic levothyroxine cannot be distinguished from the natural hormone that is secreted endogenously. Distribution - Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBA), whose capacities and affinities vary for each hormone. The higher affinity of both TBG and TBPA for T 4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic clearance, and longer half life of T 4 compared to T 3 . Protein bound thyroid hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone. Only unbound hormone is metabolically active. Many drugs and physiologic conditions affect the binding of thyroid hormones to serum proteins [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 )]. Metabolism \u2013 T 4 is slowly eliminated. The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately eighty percent of circulating T 3 is derived from peripheral T 4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T 4 and T 3 , with T 4 deiodination also occurring at a number of additional sites, including the kidney and other tissues. Approximately 80% of the daily dose of T 4 is deiodinated to yield equal amounts of T 3 and reverse T 3 (r T 3 ). T 3 and r T 3 are further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Elimination \u2013 Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged, where it is hydrolyzed and eliminated in feces as the free hormones. Urinary excretion of T 4 decreases with age.

Drug Interactions A listing of drug interaction with T 4 is provided in the following tables, although it may not be comprehensive due to the introduction of new drugs that interact with the thyroidal axis or the discovery of previously unknown interactions. The prescriber should be aware of this fact and should consult appropriate reference sources (e.g., package inserts of newly approved drugs, medical literature) for additional information if a drug-drug interaction with levothyroxine is suspected. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter T 4 and T 3 Serum Transport Without Affecting free T 4 Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drugs That May Increase Serum TBG Concentration Drugs That May Decrease Serum TBG Concentration Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin/Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen Androgens/Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid Drugs That May Cause Protein-Binding Site Displacement Potential impact : Administration of these agents with levothyroxine results in an initial transient increase in FT 4 . Continued administration results in a decrease in serum T 4 and normal FT 4 and TSH concentrations and, therefore, patients are clinically euthyroid. Salicylates (> 2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T 4 and T 3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT 4 is followed by return of FT 4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total-T 4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Furosemide (> 80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates - Phenylbutazone Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of T 4 (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of levothyroxine, resulting in increased levothyroxine requirements. Drug or Drug Class Carbamazepine Hydantoins Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of levothyroxine, and total- and free-T 4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Other drugs: Phenobarbital Rifampin Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T 4 to T 3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3 , leading to decreased T 3 levels. However, serum T 4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol > 160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T 3 and T 4 levels change slightly, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. It should be noted that actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when the hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone > 4 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T 3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T 4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T 3 and T 4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above).

Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported through the cell membrane by facilitative glucose transporter proteins and is phosphorylated within the cell to [ 18 F] FDG-6-phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase. Once phosphorylated it cannot exit until it is dephosphorylated by glucose-6-phosphatase. Therefore, within a given tissue or pathophysiological process, the retention and clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect a balance involving glucose transporter, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities. When allowance is made for the kinetic differences between glucose and Fludeoxyglucose F 18 transport and phosphorylation (expressed as the ''lumped constant'' ratio), Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is used to assess glucose metabolism. In comparison to background activity of the specific organ or tissue type, regions of decreased or absent uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect the decrease or absence of glucose metabolism. Regions of increased uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect greater than normal rates of glucose metabolism. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection USP is rapidly distributed to all organs of the body after intravenous administration. After background clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection USP, optimal PET imaging is generally achieved between 30 to 40 minutes after administration. In cancer, the cells are generally characterized by enhanced glucose metabolism partially due to (1) an increase in activity of glucose transporters, (2) an increased rate of phosphorylation activity, (3) a reduction of phosphatase activity or, (4) a dynamic alteration in the balance among all these processes. However, glucose metabolism of cancer as reflected by Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation shows considerable variability. Depending on tumor type, stage, and location, Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation may be increased, normal, or decreased. Also, inflammatory cells can have the same variability of uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18. In the heart, under normal aerobic conditions, the myocardium meets the bulk of its energy requirements by oxidizing free fatty acids. Most of the exogenous glucose taken up by the myocyte is converted into glycogen. However, under ischemic conditions, the oxidation of free fatty acids decreases, exogenous glucose becomes the preferred myocardial substrate, glycolysis is stimulated, and glucose taken up by the myocyte is metabolized immediately instead of being converted into glycogen. Under these conditions, phosphorylated Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulates in the myocyte and can be detected with PET imaging. In the brain, cells normally rely on aerobic metabolism. In epilepsy, the glucose metabolism varies. Generally, during a seizure, glucose metabolism increases. Interictally, the seizure focus tends to be hypometabolic. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distrib u tio n : In four healthy male volunteers, receiving an intravenous administration of 30 seconds in duration, the arterial blood level profile for Fludeoxyglucose F 18 decayed triexponentially. The effective half-life ranges of the three phases were 0.2-0.3 minutes, 10-13 minutes with a mean and standard deviation (STD) of 11.6 (\u00b1) 1.1 min, and 80-95 minutes with a mean and STD of 88 (\u00b1) 4 min. Plasma protein binding of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 has not been studied. Metab o lism: Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported into cells and phosphorylated to [ 1 8 F]\u00ad FDG-6- phosphate at a rate proportional to the rate of glucose utilization within that tissue. [F 18]-FDG-6-phosphate presumably is metabolized to 2-deoxy-2-[F 18]fluoro-6\u00ad phospho-D-mannose([F 18]FDM-6-phosphate). Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection USP may contain several impurities (e.g., 2-deoxy-2-chloro\u00adD-glucose (ClDG)). Biodistribution and metabolism of ClDG are presumed to be similar to Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and would be expected to result in intracellular formation of 2\u00ad deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-glucose (ClDG-6-phosphate) and 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6\u00adphospho-D-mannose (ClDM-6-phosphate). The phosphorylated deoxyglucose compounds are dephosphorylated and the resulting compounds (FDG, FDM, ClDG, and ClDM) presumably leave cells by passive diffusion. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and related compounds are cleared from non-cardiac tissues within 3 to 24 hours after administration. Clearance from the cardiac tissue may require more than 96 hours. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 that is not involved in glucose metabolism in any tissue is then excreted in the urine. Elimination: Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is cleared from most tissues within 24 hours and can be eliminated from the body unchanged in the urine. Three elimination phases have been identified in the reviewed literature. Within 33 minutes, a mean of 3.9% of the administrated radioactive dose was measured in the urine. The amount of radiation exposure of the urinary bladder at two hours post-administration suggests that 20.6% (mean) of the radioactive dose was present in the bladder. Special Populations: The pharmacokinetics of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection USP have not been studied in renally-impaired, hepatically impaired or pediatric patients. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is eliminated through the renal system. Avoid excessive radiation exposure to this organ system and adjacent tissues.

Time to 80% or Greater Block vs. Initial Dose of Rocuronium Bromide by Age Group (Median, 25th and 75th Percentile, and Individual Values) Figure 2. Duration of Clinical Effect vs. Initial Dose of Rocuronium Bromide by Age Group (Median, 25th and 75th Percentile, and Individual Values) The clinical durations for the first 5 maintenance doses, in patients receiving 5 or more maintenance doses are represented in Figure 3 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Figure 3. Duration of Clinical Effect vs. Number of Rocuronium Bromide Maintenance Doses, by Dose Once spontaneous recovery has reached 25% of control T 1 , the neuromuscular block produced by rocuronium bromide is readily reversed with anticholinesterase agents, e.g., edrophonium or neostigmine. The median spontaneous recovery from 25% to 75% T 1 was 13 minutes in adult patients. When neuromuscular block was reversed in 36 adults at a T 1 of 22% to 27%, recovery to a T 1 of 89 (50 to 132) % and T 4 /T 1 of 69 (38 to 92) % was achieved within 5 minutes. Only 5 of 320 adults reversed received an additional dose of reversal agent. The median (range) dose of neostigmine was 0.04 (0.01 to 0.09) mg/kg and the median (range) dose of edrophonium was 0.5 (0.3 to 1.0) mg/kg. In geriatric patients (n=51) reversed with neostigmine, the median T 4 /T 1 increased from 40% to 88% in 5 minutes. In clinical trials with halothane, pediatric patients (n=27) who received 0.5 mg/kg edrophonium had increases in the median T 4 /T 1 from 37% at reversal to 93% after 2 minutes. Pediatric patients (n=58) who received 1 mg/kg edrophonium had increases in the median T 4 /T 1 from 72% at reversal to 100% after 2 minutes. Infants (n=10) who were reversed with 0.03 mg/kg neostigmine recovered from 25% to 75% T 1 within 4 minutes. There were no reports of less than satisfactory clinical recovery of neuromuscular function. The neuromuscular blocking action of rocuronium bromide may be enhanced in the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. Hemodynamics There were no dose-related effects on the incidence of changes from baseline (30% or greater) in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) or heart rate associated with rocuronium bromide administration over the dose range of 0.12 to 1.2 mg/kg (4 x ED 95 ) within 5 minutes after rocuronium bromide administration and prior to intubation. Increases or decreases in MAP were observed in 2% to 5% of geriatric and other adult patients, and in about 1% of pediatric patients. Heart rate changes (30% or greater) occurred in 0% to 2% of geriatric and other adult patients. Tachycardia (30% or greater) occurred in 12 of 127 pediatric patients. Most of the pediatric patients developing tachycardia were from a single study where the patients were anesthetized with halothane and who did not receive atropine for induction [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. In U.S. studies, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation following rocuronium bromide administration were accompanied by transient tachycardia (30% or greater increases) in about one-third of adult patients under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. Animal studies have indicated that the ratio of vagal:neuromuscular block following rocuronium bromide administration is less than vecuronium but greater than pancuronium. The tachycardia observed in some patients may result from this vagal blocking activity. Histamine Release In studies of histamine release, clinically significant concentrations of plasma histamine occurred in 1 of 88 patients. Clinical signs of histamine release (flushing, rash, or bronchospasm) associated with the administration of rocuronium bromide were assessed in clinical trials and reported in 9 of 1137 (0.8%) patients. figure1 figure2 figure3 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adult and Geriatric Patients In an effort to maximize the information gathered in the in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, the data from the studies was used to develop population estimates of the parameters for the subpopulations represented (e.g., geriatric, pediatric, renal and hepatic impairment). These population-based estimates and a measure of the estimate variability are contained in the following section. Following intravenous administration of rocuronium bromide, plasma levels of rocuronium follow a three-compartment open model. The rapid distribution half-life is 1 to 2 minutes and the slower distribution half-life is 14 to 18 minutes. Rocuronium is approximately 30% bound to human plasma proteins. In geriatric and other adult surgical patients undergoing either opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen or inhalational anesthesia, the observed pharmacokinetic profile was essentially unchanged [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Table 7. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults (n=22; ages 27 to 58 yrs) and Geriatric (n=20; 65 yrs or greater) During Opioid/Nitrous Oxide/Oxygen Anesthesia PK Parameters Adults (Ages 27 to 58 yrs) Geriatrics (\u226565 yrs) Clearance (L/kg/hr) 0.25 (0.08) 0.21 (0.06) Volume of Distribution at Steady State (L/kg) 0.25 (0.04) 0.22 (0.03) t 1/2 \u03b2 Elimination (hr) 1.4 (0.4) 1.5 (0.4) In general, studies with normal adult subjects did not reveal any differences in the pharmacokinetics of rocuronium due to gender. Studies of distribution, metabolism, and excretion in cats and dogs indicate that rocuronium is eliminated primarily by the liver. The rocuronium analog 17-desacetyl-rocuronium, a metabolite, has been rarely observed in the plasma or urine of humans administered single doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg with or without a subsequent infusion (for up to 12 hr) of rocuronium. In the cat, 17-desacetyl-rocuronium has approximately one-twentieth the neuromuscular blocking potency of rocuronium. The effects of renal failure and hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rocuronium in humans are consistent with these findings. In general, patients undergoing cadaver kidney transplant have a small reduction in clearance which is offset pharmacokinetically by a corresponding increase in volume, such that the net effect is an unchanged plasma half-life. Patients with demonstrated liver cirrhosis have a marked increase in their volume of distribution resulting in a plasma half-life approximately twice that of patients with normal hepatic function. Table 8 shows the pharmacokinetic parameters in subjects with either impaired renal or hepatic function. Table 8. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults with Normal Renal and Hepatic Function (n=10, ages 23 to 65), Renal Transplant Patients (n=10, ages 21 to 45) and Hepatic Dysfunction Patients (n=9, ages 31 to 67) During Isoflurane Anesthesia PK Parameters Normal Renal and Hepatic Function Renal Transplant Patients Hepatic Dysfunction Patients Clearance (L/kg/hr) 0.16 (0.05) * 0.13 (0.04) 0.13 (0.06) Volume of Distribution at Steady State (L/kg) 0.26 (0.03) 0.34 (0.11) 0.53 (0.14) t 1/2 \u03b2 Elimination (hr) 2.4 (0.8) * 2.4 (1.1) 4.3 (2.6) * Differences in the calculated t 1/2 \u03b2 and CI between this study and the study in young adults vs. geriatrics (\u226565 years) is related to the different sample populations and anesthetic techniques. The net result of these findings is that subjects with renal failure have clinical durations that are similar to but somewhat more variable than the duration that one would expect in subjects with normal renal function. Hepatically impaired patients, due to the large increase in volume, may demonstrate clinical durations approaching 1.5 times that of subjects with normal hepatic function. In both populations the clinician should individualize the dose to the needs of the patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Tissue redistribution accounts for most (about 80%) of the initial amount of rocuronium administered. As tissue compartments fill with continued dosing (4 to 8 hours), less drug is redistributed away from the site of action and, for an infusion-only dose, the rate to maintain neuromuscular blockade falls to about 20% of the initial infusion rate. The use of a loading dose and a smaller infusion rate reduces the need for adjustment of dose. Pediatric Patients Under halothane anesthesia, the clinical duration of effects of rocuronium bromide did not vary with age in patients 4 months to 8 years of age. The terminal half-life and other pharmacokinetic parameters of rocuronium in these pediatric patients are presented in Table 9. Table 9. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Rocuronium in Pediatric Patients (ages 3 to less than 12 mos, n=6; 1 to less than 3 yrs, n=5; 3 to less than 8 yrs, n=7) During Halothane Anesthesia PK Parameters Patient Age Range 3 to <12 mos 1 to <3 yrs 3 to <8 yrs Clearance (L/kg/hr) 0.35 (0.08) 0.32 (0.07) 0.44 (0.16) Volume of Distribution at Steady State (L/kg) 0.30 (0.04) 0.26 (0.06) 0.21 (0.03) t 1/2 \u03b2 Elimination (hr) 1.3 (0.5) 1.1 (0.7) 0.8 (0.3) Pharmacokinetics of rocuronium bromide were evaluated using a population analysis of the pooled pharmacokinetic datasets from 2 trials under sevoflurane (induction) and isoflurane/nitrous oxide (maintenance) anesthesia. All pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be linearly proportional to body weight. In patients under the age of 18 years clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vss) increase with bodyweight (kg) and age (years). As a result the terminal half-life of rocuronium bromide decreases with increasing age from 1.1 hour to 0.7 to 0.8 hour. Table 10 presents the pharmacokinetic parameters in the different age groups in the studies with sevoflurane (induction) and isoflurane/nitrous oxide (maintenance) anesthesia. Table 10.

Pressor effects by direct alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor activation are mediated by increases in arterial pressures, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance. Indirect adrenergic stimulation is caused by norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Ephedrine stimulates heart rate and cardiac output and variably increases peripheral resistance; as a result, ephedrine usually increases blood pressure. Stimulation of the \u03b1-adrenergic receptors of smooth muscle cells in the bladder base may increase the resistance to the outflow of urine. Activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs promotes bronchodilation. The overall cardiovascular effect from ephedrine is the result of a balance among \u03b1-1 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction, \u03b2-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction, and \u03b2-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation.

Tranexamic Acid structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure. The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 \u03bcmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 \u03bcmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin. Elimination After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase. Excretion Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 - 2.8, 2.8 - 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment.

Chemical Structure Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY General Immediately after completion of a 15-minute intravenous infusion of UNASYN, peak serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are attained. Ampicillin serum levels are similar to those produced by the administration of equivalent amounts of ampicillin alone. Peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 109 to 150 mcg/mL are attained after administration of 2000 mg of ampicillin plus 1000 mg sulbactam and 40 to 71 mcg/mL after administration of 1000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam. The corresponding mean peak serum levels for sulbactam range from 48 to 88 mcg/mL and 21 to 40 mcg/mL, respectively. After an intramuscular injection of 1000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam, peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 8 to 37 mcg/mL and peak sulbactam serum levels ranging from 6 to 24 mcg/mL are attained. The mean serum half-life of both drugs is approximately 1 hour in healthy volunteers. Approximately 75 to 85% of both ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted unchanged in the urine during the first 8 hours after administration of UNASYN to individuals with normal renal function. Somewhat higher and more prolonged serum levels of ampicillin and sulbactam can be achieved with the concurrent administration of probenecid. In patients with impaired renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of UNASYN in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). Ampicillin has been found to be approximately 28% reversibly bound to human serum protein and sulbactam approximately 38% reversibly bound. The following average levels of ampicillin and sulbactam were measured in the tissues and fluids listed: TABLE 1 Concentration of UNASYN in Various Body Tissues and Fluids Fluid or Tissue Dose (grams) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Concentration (mcg/mL or mcg/g) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Peritoneal Fluid 0.5/0.5 IV 7/14 Blister Fluid (Cantharides) 0.5/0.5 IV 8/20 Tissue Fluid 1/0.5 IV 8/4 Intestinal Mucosa 0.5/0.5 IV 11/18 Appendix 2/1 IV 3/40 Penetration of both ampicillin and sulbactam into cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of inflamed meninges has been demonstrated after IV administration of UNASYN. The pharmacokinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam in pediatric patients receiving UNASYN are similar to those observed in adults. Immediately after a 15-minute infusion of 50 to 75 mg UNASYN/kg body weight, peak serum and plasma concentrations of 82 to 446 mcg ampicillin/mL and 44 to 203 mcg sulbactam/mL were obtained. Mean half-life values were approximately 1 hour. MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ampicillin is similar to benzyl penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible organisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall mucopeptide biosynthesis. Ampicillin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. (Ampicillin is, however, degraded by beta-lactamases and therefore the spectrum of activity does not normally include organisms which produce these enzymes). A wide range of beta-lactamases found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins have been shown in biochemical studies with cell free bacterial systems to be irreversibly inhibited by sulbactam. Although sulbactam alone possesses little useful antibacterial activity except against the Neisseriaceae , whole organism studies have shown that sulbactam restores ampicillin activity against beta-lactamase producing strains. In particular, sulbactam has good inhibitory activity against the clinically important plasmid mediated beta-lactamases most frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance. Sulbactam has no effect on the activity of ampicillin against ampicillin-susceptible strains. The presence of sulbactam in the UNASYN formulation effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of ampicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to it and to other beta-lactam antibacterials.

Its main effect, however, appears to be at the G2 portion of the cell cycle in mammalian cells. Two different dose-dependent responses are seen. At high concentrations (10 mcg/mL or more), lysis of cells entering mitosis is observed. At low concentrations (0.3 to 10 mcg/mL), cells are inhibited from entering prophase. It does not interfere with microtubular assembly. The predominant macromolecular effect of etoposide appears to be the induction of DNA strand breaks by an interaction with DNA topoisomerase II or the formation of free radicals. Pharmacokinetics On intravenous administration, the disposition of etoposide is best described as a biphasic process with a distribution half-life of about 1.5 hours and terminal elimination half-life ranging from 4 to 11 hours. Total body clearance values range from 33 to 48 mL/min or 16 to 36 mL/min/m 2 and, like the terminal elimination half-life, are independent of dose over a range of 100 to 600 mg/m 2 . Over the same dose range, the areas under the plasma concentration vs. time curves (AUC) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values increase linearly with dose. Etoposide does not accumulate in the plasma following daily administration of 100 mg/m 2 for 4 to 5 days. The mean volumes of distribution at steady state fall in the range of 18 to 29 liters or 7 to 17 L/m 2 . Etoposide enters the CSF poorly. Although it is detectable in CSF and intracerebral tumors, the concentrations are lower than in extracerebral tumors and in plasma. Etoposide concentrations are higher in normal lung than in lung metastases and are similar in primary tumors and normal tissues of the myometrium. In vitro , etoposide is highly protein bound (97%) to human plasma proteins. An inverse relationship between plasma albumin levels and etoposide renal clearance is found in children. In a study determining the effect of other therapeutic agents on the in vitro binding of carbon-14 labeled etoposide to human serum proteins, only phenylbutazone, sodium salicylate, and aspirin displaced protein-bound etoposide at concentrations achieved in vivo . Etoposide binding ratio correlates directly with serum albumin in patients with cancer and in normal volunteers. The unbound fraction of etoposide significantly correlated with bilirubin in a population of cancer patients. Data have suggested a significant Inverse correlation between serum albumin concentration and free fraction of etoposide. (See PRECAUTIONS .) After intravenous administration of 14 C-etoposide (100 to 124 mg/m 2 ), mean recovery of radioactivity in the urine was 56% of the dose at 120 hours, 45% of which was excreted as etoposide: fecal recovery of radioactivity was 44% of the dose at 120 hours. In children, approximately 55% of the dose is excreted in the urine as etoposide in 24 hours. The mean renal clearance of etoposide is 7 to 10 mL/min/m 2 or about 35% of the total body clearance over a dose range of 80 to 600 mg/m 2 . Etoposide, therefore, is cleared by both renal and nonrenal processes, i.e., metabolism and biliary excretion. The effect of renal disease on plasma etoposide clearance is not known. Biliary excretion of unchanged drug and/or metabolites is an important route of etoposide elimination as fecal recovery of radioactivity is 44% of the intravenous dose. The hydroxy acid metabolite [4\u2019-demethylepipodophyllic acid-9-(4,6-O-(R)-ethylidene-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside)], formed by opening of the lactone ring, is found in the urine of adults and children. It is also present in human plasma, presumably as the trans isomer. Glucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates of etoposide are also excreted in human urine. Only 8% or less of an intravenous dose is excreted in the urine as radiolabeled metabolites of 14 C-etoposide. In addition, O-demethylation of the dimethoxyphenol ring occurs through the CYP450 3A4 isoenzyme pathway to produce the corresponding catechol. After intravenous infusion, the Cmax and AUC values exhibit marked intra- and inter-subject variability. There is no evidence of a first-pass effect for etoposide. For example, no correlation exists between the absolute oral bioavailability of etoposide capsules and nonrenal clearance. No evidence exists for any other differences in etoposide metabolism and excretion after administration of oral capsules as compared to intravenous infusion. In adults, the total body clearance of etoposide is correlated with creatinine clearance, serum albumin concentration, and nonrenal clearance. Patients with impaired renal function receiving etoposide have exhibited reduced total body clearance, increased AUC and a lower volume of distribution at steady state. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Use of cisplatin therapy is associated with reduced total body clearance. In children, elevated serum SGPT levels are associated with reduced drug total body clearance. Prior use of cisplatin may also result in a decrease of etoposide total body clearance in children.

It acts by competing for cholinergic receptors at the motor end-plate. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine and edrophonium. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The ED95 (dose required to produce 95% suppression of the first [T1] mechanomyographic [MMG] response of the adductor pollicis muscle [thumb] to indirect supramaximal train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve) during opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia is approximately 0.3 mg/kg. Patient variability around the ED95 dose suggests that 50% of patients will exhibit T1 depression of 91% to 97%. Table 4 presents intubating conditions in patients with intubation initiated at 60 to 70 seconds.

Clinical duration=time until return to 25% of control T1. Patients receiving doses of 0.45 mg/kg who achieved less than 90% block (16% of these patients) had about 12 to 15 minutes to 25% recovery. Table 6 presents the time to onset and clinical duration for the initial dose of rocuronium bromide injection under sevoflurane (induction) and isoflurane/nitrous oxide (maintenance) anesthesia in pediatric patients.

The time to 80% or greater block and clinical duration as a function of dose are presented in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1: Time to 80% or Greater Block vs. Initial Dose of Rocuronium Bromide by Age Group (Median, 25th and 75th Percentile, and Individual Values) Figure 2: Duration of Clinical Effect vs. Initial Dose of Rocuronium Bromide by Age Group (Median, 25th and 75th Percentile, and Individual Values) The clinical durations for the first 5 maintenance doses, in patients receiving 5 or more maintenance doses are represented in Figure 3 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Figure 3: Duration of Clinical Effect vs. Number of Rocuronium Bromide Maintenance Doses, by Dose Once spontaneous recovery has reached 25% of control T1, the neuromuscular block produced by rocuronium bromide is readily reversed with anticholinesterase agents, e.g., edrophonium or neostigmine. The median spontaneous recovery from 25% to 75% T1 was 13 minutes in adult patients. When neuromuscular block was reversed in 36 adults at a T1 of 22% to 27%, recovery to a T1 of 89 (50 to 132)% and T4/T1 of 69 (38 to 92)% was achieved within 5 minutes. Only 5 of 320 adults reversed received an additional dose of reversal agent. The median (range) dose of neostigmine was 0.04 (0.01 to 0.09) mg/kg and the median (range) dose of edrophonium was 0.5 (0.3 to 1.0) mg/kg. In geriatric patients (n=51) reversed with neostigmine, the median T4/T1 increased from 40% to 88% in 5 minutes. In clinical trials with halothane, pediatric patients (n=27) who received 0.5 mg/kg edrophonium had increases in the median T4/T1 from 37% at reversal to 93% after 2 minutes. Pediatric patients (n=58) who received 1 mg/kg edrophonium had increases in the median T4/T1 from 72% at reversal to 100% after 2 minutes. Infants (n=10) who were reversed with 0.03 mg/kg neostigmine recovered from 25% to 75% T1 within 4 minutes. There were no reports of less than satisfactory clinical recovery of neuromuscular function. The neuromuscular blocking action of rocuronium bromide may be enhanced in the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Hemodynamics There were no dose-related effects on the incidence of changes from baseline (30% or greater) in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) or heart rate associated with rocuronium bromide administration over the dose range of 0.12 to 1.2 mg/kg (4 \u00d7 ED95) within 5 minutes after rocuronium bromide administration and prior to intubation. Increases or decreases in MAP were observed in 2% to 5% of geriatric and other adult patients, and in about 1% of pediatric patients. Heart rate changes (30% or greater) occurred in 0% to 2% of geriatric and other adult patients. Tachycardia (30% or greater) occurred in 12 of 127 pediatric patients. Most of the pediatric patients developing tachycardia were from a single study where the patients were anesthetized with halothane and who did not receive atropine for induction [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. In U.S. studies, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation following rocuronium bromide administration were accompanied by transient tachycardia (30% or greater increases) in about one-third of adult patients under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. Animal studies have indicated that the ratio of vagal:neuromuscular block following rocuronium bromide administration is less than vecuronium but greater than pancuronium. The tachycardia observed in some patients may result from this vagal blocking activity. Histamine Release In studies of histamine release, clinically significant concentrations of plasma histamine occurred in 1 of 88 patients. Clinical signs of histamine release (flushing, rash, or bronchospasm) associated with the administration of rocuronium bromide were assessed in clinical trials and reported in 9 of 1137 (0.8%) patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adult and Geriatric Patients In an effort to maximize the information gathered in the in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, the data from the studies was used to develop population estimates of the parameters for the subpopulations represented (e.g., geriatric, pediatric, renal, and hepatic impairment). These population-based estimates and a measure of the estimate variability are contained in the following section. Following intravenous administration of rocuronium bromide, plasma levels of rocuronium follow a three-compartment open model. The rapid distribution half-life is 1 to 2 minutes and the slower distribution half-life is 14 to 18 minutes. Rocuronium is approximately 30% bound to human plasma proteins. In geriatric and other adult surgical patients undergoing either opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen or inhalational anesthesia, the observed pharmacokinetic profile was essentially unchanged [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Table 7: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults (n=22; ages 27 to 58 yrs) and Geriatric (n=20; 65 yrs or greater) During Opioid/Nitrous Oxide/Oxygen Anesthesia In general, studies with normal adult subjects did not reveal any differences in the pharmacokinetics of rocuronium due to gender. Studies of distribution, metabolism, and excretion in cats and dogs indicate that rocuronium is eliminated primarily by the liver. The rocuronium analog 17-desacetyl-rocuronium, a metabolite, has been rarely observed in the plasma or urine of humans administered single doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg with or without a subsequent infusion (for up to 12 hr) of rocuronium. In the cat, 17-desacetyl-rocuronium has approximately one-twentieth the neuromuscular blocking potency of rocuronium. The effects of renal failure and hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rocuronium in humans are consistent with these findings. In general, patients undergoing cadaver kidney transplant have a small reduction in clearance which is offset pharmacokinetically by a corresponding increase in volume, such that the net effect is an unchanged plasma half-life. Patients with demonstrated liver cirrhosis have a marked increase in their volume of distribution resulting in a plasma half-life approximately twice that of patients with normal hepatic function. Table 8 shows the pharmacokinetic parameters in subjects with either impaired renal or hepatic function. Table 8: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults with Normal Renal and Hepatic Function (n=10, ages 23 to 65), Renal Transplant Patients (n=10, ages 21 to 45), and Hepatic Dysfunction Patients (n=9, ages 31 to 67) During Isoflurane Anesthesia *Differences in the calculated t1/2\u03b2 and Cl between this study and the study in young adults vs. geriatrics (\u226565 years) is related to the different sample populations and anesthetic techniques. The net result of these findings is that subjects with renal failure have clinical durations that are similar to but somewhat more variable than the duration that one would expect in subjects with normal renal function. Hepatically impaired patients, due to the large increase in volume, may demonstrate clinical durations approaching 1.5 times that of subjects with normal hepatic function. In both populations the clinician should individualize the dose to the needs of the patient [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Tissue redistribution accounts for most (about 80%) of the initial amount of rocuronium administered. As tissue compartments fill with continued dosing (4 to 8 hours), less drug is redistributed away from the site of action and, for an infusion-only dose, the rate to maintain neuromuscular blockade falls to about 20% of the initial infusion rate. The use of a loading dose and a smaller infusion rate reduces the need for adjustment of dose. Pediatric Patients Under halothane anesthesia, the clinical duration of effects of rocuronium bromide did not vary with age in patients 4 months to 8 years of age. The terminal half-life and other pharmacokinetic parameters of rocuronium in these pediatric patients are presented in Table 9. Table 9: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Rocuronium in Pediatric Patients (ages 3 to less than 12 mos, n=6; 1 to less than 3 yrs, n=5; 3 to less than 8 yrs, n=7) During Halothane Anesthesia Pharmacokinetics of rocuronium bromide were evaluated using a population analysis of the pooled pharmacokinetic datasets from 2 trials under sevoflurane (induction) and isoflurane/nitrous oxide (maintenance) anesthesia. All pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be linearly proportional to body weight. In patients under the age of 18 years clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vss) increase with bodyweight (kg) and age (years). As a result the terminal half-life of rocuronium bromide decreases with increasing age from 1.1 hour to 0.7 to 0.8 hour. Table 10 presents the pharmacokinetic parameters in the different age groups in the studies with sevoflurane (induction) and isoflurane/nitrous oxide (maintenance) anesthesia.

The chemical name of levetiracetam, a single enantiomer, is (-)-(S)-\u03b1-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide, its molecular formula is C 8 H 14 N 2 O 2 and its molecular weight is 170.21. Levetiracetam is chemically unrelated to existing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). It has the following structural formula: Levetiracetam, USP is a white to off-white crystalline powder with a faint odor and a bitter taste. It is very soluble in water (104.0 g/100 mL). It is freely soluble in chloroform (65.3 g/100 mL) and in methanol (53.6 g/100 mL), soluble in ethanol (16.5 g/100 mL), sparingly soluble in acetonitrile (5.7 g/100 mL) and practically insoluble in n-hexane.

Levetiracetam Injection must be diluted prior to intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] . Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism(s) by which levetiracetam exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown. A saturable and stereoselective neuronal binding site in rat brain tissue has been described for levetiracetam. Experimental data indicate that this binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, thought to be involved in the regulation of vesicle exocytosis. Although the molecular significance of levetiracetam binding to synaptic vesicle protein SV2A is not understood, levetiracetam and related analogs showed a rank order of affinity for SV2A which correlated with the potency of their antiseizure activity in audiogenic seizure-prone mice. These findings suggest that the interaction of levetiracetam with the SV2A protein may contribute to the antiepileptic mechanism of action of the drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on QTc Interval The effect of Levetiracetam Injection on QTc prolongation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) and placebo-controlled crossover study of Levetiracetam Injection (1000 mg or 5000 mg) in 52 healthy subjects. The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc was below 10 milliseconds. Therefore, there was no evidence of significant QTc prolongation in this study. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) levetiracetam and oral levetiracetam result in equivalent C max , C min , and total systemic exposure to levetiracetam when the IV levetiracetam is administered as a 15-minute infusion. Overview Levetiracetam is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. Levetiracetam injection and tablets are bioequivalent. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (<10% bound) and its volume of distribution is close to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam (24% of dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. It is not liver cytochrome P450 dependent. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. Plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6-8 hours. It is increased in the elderly (primarily due to impaired renal clearance) and in subjects with renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures. Distribution The equivalence of levetiracetam injection and the oral formulation was demonstrated in a bioavailability study of 17 healthy volunteers. In this study, levetiracetam 1500 mg was diluted in 100 mL 0.9% sterile saline solution and was infused over 15 minutes. The selected infusion rate provided plasma concentrations of levetiracetam at the end of the infusion period similar to those achieved at T max after an equivalent oral dose. It is demonstrated that levetiracetam 1500 mg intravenous infusion is equivalent to levetiracetam 3 x 500 mg oral tablets. The time independent pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam was demonstrated following 1500 mg intravenous infusion for 4 days with BID dosing. The AUC (0-12) at steady-state was equivalent to AUC inf following an equivalent single dose. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite are less than 10% bound to plasma proteins; clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are therefore unlikely. Metabolism Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose) and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The major metabolite is inactive in animal seizure models. Two minor metabolites were identified as the product of hydroxylation of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring (2% of dose) and opening of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring in position 5 (1% of dose). There is no enantiomeric interconversion of levetiracetam or its major metabolite. Elimination Levetiracetam plasma half-life in adults is 7 \u00b1 1 hour and is unaffected by either dose, route of administration or repeated administration. Levetiracetam is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug which represents 66% of administered dose. The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The mechanism of excretion is glomerular filtration with subsequent partial tubular reabsorption. The metabolite ucb L057 is excreted by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. Levetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance. Levetiracetam clearance is reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . Specific Populations Elderly Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 16 elderly subjects (age 61-88 years) with creatinine clearance ranging from 30 to 74 mL/min. Following oral administration of twice-daily dosing for 10 days, total body clearance decreased by 38% and the half-life was 2.5 hours longer in the elderly compared to healthy adults. This is most likely due to the decrease in renal function in these subjects. Pediatric Patients \u2022 Intravenous Formulation A population pharmacokinetic analysis for the intravenous formulation was conducted in 49 pediatric patients (1 month to < 16 years of age) weighing 3-79 kg. Patients received levetiracetam as a 15-minute IV infusion at doses between 14 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day twice daily. Plasma concentrations and model derived steady-state exposure AUC (0-12) were within the range of the exposure observed in pediatric patients receiving equivalent doses of the oral solution. \u2022 Oral Formulations Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 24 pediatric patients (age 6-12 years) after single oral dose (20 mg/kg) of the immediate release formulation of Levetiracetam. The body weight adjusted apparent clearance of levetiracetam was approximately 40% higher than in adults. A repeat dose pharmacokinetic study was conducted in pediatric patients (age 4-12 years) at doses of 20 mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day, and 60 mg/kg/day of the immediate release formulation of Levetiracetam. The evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam and its metabolite (ucb L057) in 14 pediatric patients demonstrated rapid absorption of levetiracetam at all doses, with a T max of about 1 hour and a t 1/2 of 5 hours across all dosing levels. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam in pediatric patients was linear between 20 to 60 mg/kg/day. The potential interaction of levetiracetam with other AEDs was also evaluated in these patients. Levetiracetam had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate or lamotrigine. However, there was about a 22% increase of apparent clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with an enzyme-inducing AED (e.g., carbamazepine). Following single dose administration (20 mg/kg) of a 10% oral solution to pediatric patients with epilepsy (1 month to < 4 years), levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed and peak plasma concentrations were observed approximately 1 hour after dosing. Levetiracetam half-life in pediatric patients 1 month to < 4 years with epilepsy was shorter (5.3 h) than in adults (7.2 h), and apparent clearance (1.5 mL/min/kg) was faster than in adults (0.96 mL/min/kg). Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that body weight was significantly correlated to the clearance of levetiracetam in pediatric patients; clearance increased with an increase in body weight. Pregnancy Levetiracetam levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] . Gender Levetiracetam C max and AUC were 20% higher in women (N=11) compared to men (N=12). However, clearances adjusted for body weight were comparable. Race Formal pharmacokinetic studies of the effects of race have not been conducted. Cross-study comparisons involving Caucasians (N=12) and Asians (N=12), however, show that pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were comparable between the two races. Because levetiracetam is primarily renally excreted and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected. Renal Impairment The disposition of levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with impaired renal function by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50-80 mL/min), 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30-50 mL/min) and 60% in the severe renal impairment group (CLcr <30 mL/min). Clearance of levetiracetam is correlated with creatinine clearance. In anuric (end stage renal disease) patients, the total body clearance decreased 70% compared to normal subjects (CLcr >80mL/min). Approximately 50% of the pool of levetiracetam in the body is removed during a standard 4 hour hemodialysis procedure [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) ] . Hepatic Impairment In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were unchanged. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), total body clearance was 50% that of normal subjects, but decreased renal clearance accounted for most of the decrease. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions In vitro data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above C max levels achieved within the therapeutic dose range, are neither inhibitors of, nor high affinity substrates for, human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms, epoxide hydrolase or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes. In addition, levetiracetam does not affect the in vitro glucuronidation of valproic acid. Potential pharmacokinetic interactions of or with levetiracetam were assessed in clinical pharmacokinetic studies (phenytoin, valproate, warfarin, digoxin, oral contraceptive, probenecid) and through pharmacokinetic screening in the placebo-controlled clinical studies in epilepsy patients. Phenytoin Levetiracetam Injection (3000 mg daily) had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of phenytoin in patients with refractory epilepsy. Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were also not affected by phenytoin. Valproate Levetiracetam Injection (1500 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of valproate in healthy volunteers. Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption or its plasma clearance or urinary excretion. There also was no effect on exposure to and the excretion of the primary metabolite, ucb L057. Other Antiepileptic Drugs Potential drug interactions between Levetiracetam Injection and other AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and valproate) were also assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these AEDs during placebo-controlled clinical studies. These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs and that these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. Effect of AEDs in Pediatric Patients There was about a 22% increase of apparent total body clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with enzyme-inducing AEDs. Dose adjustment is not recommended. Levetiracetam had no effect on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, or lamotrigine. Oral Contraceptives Levetiracetam Injection (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, or of the luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. Digoxin Levetiracetam Injection (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (ECG) of digoxin given as a 0.25 mg dose every day. Co-administration of digoxin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. Warfarin Levetiracetam Injection (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of R and S warfarin. Prothrombin time was not affected by levetiracetam. Coadministration of warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. Probenecid Probenecid, a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, administered at a dose of 500 mg four times a day, did not change the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam 1000 mg twice daily. C ss max of the metabolite, ucb L057, was approximately doubled in the presence of probenecid while the fraction of drug excreted unchanged in the urine remained the same. Renal clearance of ucb L057 in the presence of probenecid decreased 60%, probably related to competitive inhibition of tubular secretion of ucb L057.

Relative to doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection doses at or below 20 mg/m 2 , the pharmacokinetics of total doxorubicin following a 50 mg/m 2 doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection dose are nonlinear. At this dose, the elimination half-life of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection is longer and the clearance lower compared to a 20 mg/m 2 dose. Distribution Direct measurement of liposomal doxorubicin shows that at least 90% of the drug (the assay used cannot quantify less than 5-10% free doxorubicin) remains liposome-encapsulated during circulation. In contrast to doxorubicin, which displays a large volume of distribution (range 700 to 1,100 L/m 2 ), the small steady state volume of distribution of liposomal doxorubicin suggests that doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection is largely confined to vascular fluid.

The peripheral vasodilating effect of hydralazine results in decreased arterial blood pressure (diastolic more than systolic); decreased peripheral vascular resistance; and an increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. The preferential dilatation of arterioles, as compared to veins, minimizes postural hypotension and promotes the increase in cardiac output. Hydralazine usually increases renin activity in plasma, presumably as a result of increased secretion of renin by the renal juxtaglomerular cells in response to reflex sympathetic discharge. This increase in renin activity leads to the production of angiotensin II, which then causes stimulation of aldosterone and consequent sodium reabsorption.

This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. Paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or \"bundles\" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/m 2 (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage) were determined in clinical studies. Dose levels of mg/m 2 refer to mg of paclitaxel in paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound). Following intravenous administration of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) to patients with solid tumors, paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner, the initial rapid decline representing distribution to the peripheral compartment and the slower second phase representing drug elimination. Following paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) infusion, paclitaxel exhibited linear drug exposure (AUC) across clinical doses ranging from 80 to 300 mg/m 2 (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage). The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) were independent of the duration of intravenous administration. The pharmacokinetic data of 260 mg/m 2 paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) administered over a 30-minute infusion was compared to the pharmacokinetics of 175 mg/m 2 paclitaxel injection over a 3-hour infusion. Clearance was larger (43%) and the volume of distribution was higher (53%) for paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) than for paclitaxel injection. There were no differences in terminal half-lives. Distribution Following paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) administration to patients with solid tumors, paclitaxel is evenly distributed into blood cells and plasma and is highly bound to plasma proteins (94%). The total volume of distribution is approximately 1741 L; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding of paclitaxel. In a within-patient comparison study, the fraction of unbound paclitaxel in plasma was significantly higher with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) (6.2%) than with solvent-based paclitaxel (2.3%). This contributes to significantly higher exposure to unbound paclitaxel with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) compared with solvent-based paclitaxel, when the total exposure is comparable. In vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins, using paclitaxel concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 \u00b5g/mL, indicated that the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel. Elimination At the clinical dose range of 80 to 300 mg/m 2 (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage), the mean total clearance of paclitaxel ranges from 13 to 30 L/h/m 2 and the mean terminal half-life ranges from 13 to 27 hours. Metabolism In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices showed that paclitaxel in paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) was metabolized primarily to 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel by CYP2C8; and to two minor metabolites, 3'- p -hydroxypaclitaxel and 6\u03b1, 3'- p -dihydroxypaclitaxel, by CYP3A4. In vitro , the metabolism of paclitaxel to 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel was inhibited by a number of agents (ketoconazole, verapamil, diazepam, quinidine, dexamethasone, cyclosporin, teniposide, etoposide, and vincristine), but the concentrations used exceeded those found in vivo following normal therapeutic doses. Testosterone, 17\u03b1-ethinyl estradiol, retinoic acid, and quercetin, a specific inhibitor of CYP2C8, also inhibited the formation of 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel in vitro . The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel may also be altered in vivo as a result of interactions with compounds that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A4 [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Excretion After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg/m 2 doses of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound), the mean values for cumulative urinary recovery of unchanged drug (4%) indicated extensive non-renal clearance. Less than 1% of the total administered dose was excreted in urine as the metabolites 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3'- p -hydroxypaclitaxel.

Paclitaxel exists in the particles in a non-crystalline, amorphous state. Paclitaxel is a microtubule inhibitor. The chemical name for paclitaxel is 5\u03b2,20-Epoxy-1,2\u03b1,4,7\u03b2,10\u03b2,13\u03b1-hexahydroxytax-11-en-9-one 4,10-diacetate 2-benzoate 13-ester with (2 R ,3 S )- N -benzoyl-3-phenylisoserine. The molecular formula is C 47 H 51 NO 14 and the molecular weight is 853.91. Paclitaxel has the following structural formula: Paclitaxel is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is highly lipophilic, insoluble in water, and melts at approximately 216\u00b0C to 217\u00b0C. Paclitaxel Protein-Bound Particles for Injectable Suspension (albumin-bound) is supplied as a white to yellow, sterile, lyophilized powder for reconstitution with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection prior to intravenous infusion. Each single-dose vial contains 100 mg of paclitaxel, approximately 900 mg of human albumin (containing sodium caprylate and sodium acetyltryptophanate), and approximately 23 mg sodium chloride. Each milliliter (mL) of reconstituted suspension contains 5 mg paclitaxel. Paclitaxel Protein-Bound Particles for Injectable Suspension (albumin-bound) is free of solvents. 1"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paclitaxel Protein-Bound Particles for Injectable Suspension (albumin-bound) is a microtubule inhibitor that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. Paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or \u201cbundles\u201d of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of protein bound paclitaxel at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/m 2 (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage) were determined in clinical studies. Dose levels of mg/m 2 refer to mg of paclitaxel in protein bound paclitaxel. Following intravenous administration of protein bound paclitaxel to patients with solid tumors, paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner, the initial rapid decline representing distribution to the peripheral compartment and the slower second phase representing drug elimination. Following protein bound paclitaxel infusion, paclitaxel exhibited linear drug exposure (AUC) across clinical doses ranging from 80 to 300 mg/m 2 (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage). The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in protein bound paclitaxel were independent of the duration of intravenous administration. The pharmacokinetic data of 260 mg/m 2 protein bound paclitaxel administered over a 30-minute infusion was compared to the pharmacokinetics of 175 mg/m 2 paclitaxel injection over a 3-hour infusion. Clearance was larger (43%) and the volume of distribution was higher (53%) for protein bound paclitaxel than for paclitaxel injection. There were no differences in terminal half-lives. Distribution Following protein bound paclitaxel administration to patients with solid tumors, paclitaxel is evenly distributed into blood cells and plasma and is highly bound to plasma proteins (94%). The total volume of distribution is approximately 1,741 L; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding of paclitaxel. In a within-patient comparison study, the fraction of unbound paclitaxel in plasma was significantly higher with protein bound paclitaxel (6.2%) than with solvent-based paclitaxel (2.3%). This contributes to significantly higher exposure to unbound paclitaxel with protein bound paclitaxel compared with solvent-based paclitaxel, when the total exposure is comparable. In vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins, using paclitaxel concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 mcg/mL, indicated that the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel. Elimination At the clinical dose range of 80 to 300 mg/m 2 (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage), the mean total clearance of paclitaxel ranges from 13 to 30 L/h/m 2 and the mean terminal half-life ranges from 13 to 27 hours. Metabolism In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices showed that paclitaxel in protein bound paclitaxel was metabolized primarily to 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel by CYP2C8; and to two minor metabolites, 3\u2019- p -hydroxypaclitaxel and 6\u03b1, 3\u2019- p -dihydroxypaclitaxel, by CYP3A4. In vitro , the metabolism of paclitaxel to 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel was inhibited by a number of agents (ketoconazole, verapamil, diazepam, quinidine, dexamethasone, cyclosporin, teniposide, etoposide, and vincristine), but the concentrations used exceeded those found in vivo following normal therapeutic doses. Testosterone, 17\u03b1-ethinyl estradiol, retinoic acid, and quercetin, a specific inhibitor of CYP2C8, also inhibited the formation of 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel in vitro . The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel may also be altered in vivo as a result of interactions with compounds that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A4 [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Excretion After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg/m 2 doses of protein bound paclitaxel, the mean values for cumulative urinary recovery of unchanged drug (4%) indicated extensive non-renal clearance. Less than 1% of the total administered dose was excreted in urine as the metabolites 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3\u2019- p -hydroxypaclitaxel. Fecal excretion was approximately 20% of the total dose administered.

Formula1.jpg"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Investigations into the mode of action of furosemide have utilized micropuncture studies in rats, stop flow experiments in dogs and various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. It has been demonstrated that furosemide inhibits primarily the reabsorption of sodium and chloride not only in the proximal and distal tubules but also in the loop of Henle. The high degree of efficacy is largely due to this unique site of action. The action on the distal tubule is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone. Recent evidence suggests that furosemide glucuronide is the only or at least the major biotransformation product of furosemide in man. Furosemide is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. Plasma concentrations ranging from 1 to 400 mcg/mL are 91 to 99% bound in healthy individuals. The unbound fraction averages 2.3 to 4.1% at therapeutic concentrations. The onset of diuresis following intravenous administration is within 5 minutes and somewhat later after intramuscular administration. The peak effect occurs within the first half hour. The duration of diuretic effect is approximately 2 hours. In fasted normal men, the mean bioavailability of furosemide from furosemide tablets and furosemide oral solution is 64% and 60%, respectively, of that from an intravenous injection of the drug. Although furosemide is more rapidly absorbed from the oral solution (50 minutes) than from the tablet (87 minutes), peak plasma levels and area under the plasma concentration-time curves do not differ significantly. Peak plasma concentrations increase with increasing dose but times-to-peak do not differ among doses. The terminal half-life of furosemide is approximately 2 hours. Significantly more furosemide is excreted in urine following the intravenous injection than after the tablet or oral solution. There are no significant differences between the two oral formulations in the amount of unchanged drug excreted in urine. Geriatric Population Furosemide binding to albumin may be reduced in elderly patients. Furosemide is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine. The renal clearance of furosemide after intravenous administration in older healthy male subjects (60 to 70 years of age) is statistically significantly smaller than in younger healthy male subjects (20 to 35 years of age). The initial diuretic effect of furosemide in older subjects is decreased relative to younger subjects.

FIGURE 3: Duration of Clinical Effect vs. Number of Rocuronium Bromide Maintenance Doses, by Dose Once spontaneous recovery has reached 25% of control T 1 , the neuromuscular block produced by Rocuronium Bromide is readily reversed with anticholinesterase agents, e.g., edrophonium or neostigmine. The median spontaneous recovery from 25% to 75% T 1 was 13 minutes in adult patients. When neuromuscular block was reversed in 36 adults at a T 1 of 22% to 27%, recovery to a T 1 of 89 (50\u2013132)% and T 4 /T 1 of 69 (38\u201392)% was achieved within 5 minutes. Only 5 of 320 adults reversed received an additional dose of reversal agent. The median (range) dose of neostigmine was 0.04 (0.01\u20130.09) mg/kg and the median (range) dose of edrophonium was 0.5 (0.3\u20131.0) mg/kg. In geriatric patients (n=51) reversed with neostigmine, the median T 4 / T 1 increased from 40% to 88% in 5 minutes. In clinical trials with halothane, pediatric patients (n=27) who received 0.5 mg/kg edrophonium had increases in the median T 4 /T 1 from 37% at reversal to 93% after 2 minutes. Pediatric patients (n=58) who received 1 mg/kg edrophonium had increases in the median T 4 /T 1 from 72% at reversal to 100% after 2 minutes. Infants (n=10) who were reversed with 0.03 mg/kg neostigmine recovered from 25% to 75% T 1 within 4 minutes. There were no reports of less than satisfactory clinical recovery of neuromuscular function. The neuromuscular blocking action of Rocuronium Bromide may be enhanced in the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . Hemodynamics: There were no dose-related effects on the incidence of changes from baseline (30% or greater) in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) or heart rate associated with Rocuronium Bromide administration over the dose range of 0.12 to 1.2 mg/kg (4 \u00d7 ED95) within 5 minutes after Rocuronium Bromide administration and prior to intubation. Increases or decreases in MAP were observed in 2% to 5% of geriatric and other adult patients, and in about 1% of pediatric patients. Heart rate changes (30% or greater) occurred in 0% to 2% of geriatric and other adult patients. Tachycardia (30% or greater) occurred in 12 of 127 pediatric patients. Most of the pediatric patients developing tachycardia were from a single study where the patients were anesthetized with halothane and who did not receive atropine for induction [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . In US studies, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation following Rocuronium Bromide administration were accompanied by transient tachycardia (30% or greater increases) in about one-third of adult patients under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. Animal studies have indicated that the ratio of vagal:neuromuscular block following Rocuronium Bromide administration is less than vecuronium but greater than pancuronium. The tachycardia observed in some patients may result from this vagal blocking activity. Histamine Release: In studies of histamine release, clinically significant concentrations of plasma histamine occurred in 1 of 88 patients. Clinical signs of histamine release (flushing, rash, or bronchospasm) associated with the administration of Rocuronium Bromide were assessed in clinical trials and reported in 9 of 1137 (0.8%) patients.

These population-based estimates and a measure of the estimate variability are contained in the following section. Following intravenous administration of Rocuronium Bromide, plasma levels of rocuronium follow a three-compartment open model. The rapid distribution half-life is 1 to 2 minutes and the slower distribution half-life is 14 to 18 minutes. Rocuronium is approximately 30% bound to human plasma proteins. In geriatric and other adult surgical patients undergoing either opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen or inhalational anesthesia, the observed pharmacokinetic profile was essentially unchanged [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ].

Studies of distribution, metabolism, and excretion in cats and dogs indicate that rocuronium is eliminated primarily by the liver. The rocuronium analog 17-desacetyl-rocuronium, a metabolite, has been rarely observed in the plasma or urine of humans administered single doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg with or without a subsequent infusion (for up to 12 hr) of rocuronium. In the cat, 17-desacetyl-rocuronium has approximately one-twentieth the neuromuscular blocking potency of rocuronium. The effects of renal failure and hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rocuronium in humans are consistent with these findings. In general, patients undergoing cadaver kidney transplant have a small reduction in clearance which is offset pharmacokinetically by a corresponding increase in volume, such that the net effect is an unchanged plasma half-life. Patients with demonstrated liver cirrhosis have a marked increase in their volume of distribution resulting in a plasma half-life approximately twice that of patients with normal hepatic function. Table 8 shows the pharmacokinetic parameters in subjects with either impaired renal or hepatic function. Table 8: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults with Normal Renal and Hepatic Function (n=10, ages 23 to 65), Renal Transplant Patients (n=10, ages 21 to 45), and Hepatic Dysfunction Patients (n=9, ages 31 to 67) During Isoflurane Anesthesia PK Parameters Normal Renal and Hepatic Function Renal Transplant Patients Hepatic Dysfunction Patients Clearance (L/kg/hr) Volume of Distribution at Steady State (L/kg) 0.16 (0.05) Differences in the calculated t 1/2 \u03b2 and Cl between this study and the study in young adults vs. geriatrics (\u226565 years) is related to the different sample populations and anesthetic techniques. 0.26 (0.03) 0.13 (0.04) 0.34 (0.11) 0.13 (0.06) 0.53 (0.14) t 1/2 \u03b2 Elimination (hr) 2.4 (0.8) 2.4 (1.1) 4.3 (2.6) The net result of these findings is that subjects with renal failure have clinical durations that are similar to but somewhat more variable than the duration that one would expect in subjects with normal renal function. Hepatically impaired patients, due to the large increase in volume, may demonstrate clinical durations approaching 1.5 times that of subjects with normal hepatic function. In both populations the clinician should individualize the dose to the needs of the patient [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Tissue redistribution accounts for most (about 80%) of the initial amount of rocuronium administered. As tissue compartments fill with continued dosing (4\u20138 hours), less drug is redistributed away from the site of action and, for an infusion-only dose, the rate to maintain neuromuscular blockade falls to about 20% of the initial infusion rate. The use of a loading dose and a smaller infusion rate reduces the need for adjustment of dose. Pediatric Patients Under halothane anesthesia, the clinical duration of effects of Rocuronium Bromide did not vary with age in patients 4 months to 8 years of age. The terminal half-life and other pharmacokinetic parameters of rocuronium in these pediatric patients are presented in Table 9. Table 9: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Rocuronium in Pediatric Patients (ages 3 to less than 12 mos, n=6; 1 to less than 3 yrs, n=5; 3 to less than 8 yrs, n=7) During Halothane Anesthesia Patient Age Range PK Parameters 3 to <12 mos 1 to <3 yrs 3 to <8 yrs Clearance (L/kg/hr) Volume of Distribution at Steady State (L/kg) 0.35 (0.08) 0.30 (0.04) 0.32 (0.07) 0.26 (0.06) 0.44 (0.16) 0.21 (0.03) t 1/2 \u03b2 Elimination (hr) 1.3 (0.5) 1.1 (0.7) 0.8 (0.3) Pharmacokinetics of Rocuronium Bromide were evaluated using a population analysis of the pooled pharmacokinetic datasets from 2 trials under sevoflurane (induction) and isoflurane/nitrous oxide (maintenance) anesthesia. All pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be linearly proportional to body weight. In patients under the age of 18 years clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vss) increase with bodyweight (kg) and age (years). As a result the terminal half-life of Rocuronium Bromide decreases with increasing age from 1.1 hour to 0.7-0.8 hour.

{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE CORTROSYN \u00ae (cosyntropin) for Injection is intended for use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency. Because of its rapid effect on the adrenal cortex it may be utilized to perform a 30-minute test of adrenal function (plasma cortisol response) as an office or outpatient procedure, using only 2 venipunctures (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). Severe hypofunction of the pituitary - adrenal axis is usually associated with subnormal plasma cortisol values but a low basal level is not per se evidence of adrenal insufficiency and does not suffice to make the diagnosis. Many patients with proven insufficiency will have normal basal levels and will develop signs of insufficiency only when stressed. For this reason a criterion which should be used in establishing the diagnosis is the failure to respond to adequate corticotropin stimulation. When presumptive adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed by a subnormal CORTROSYN \u00ae test, further studies are indicated to determine if it is primary or secondary. Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison\u2019s disease) is the result of an intrinsic disease process, such as tuberculosis within the gland. The production of adrenocortical hormones is deficient despite high ACTH levels (feedback mechanism). Secondary or relative insufficiency arises as the result of defective production of ACTH leading in turn to disuse atrophy of the adrenal cortex. It is commonly seen, for example, as result of corticosteroid therapy, Sheehan\u2019s syndrome and pituitary tumors or ablation. The differentiation of both types is based on the premise that a primarily defective gland cannot be stimulated by ACTH whereas a secondarily defective gland is potentially functional and will respond to adequate stimulation with ACTH. Patients selected for further study as the result of a subnormal CORTROSYN \u00ae test should be given a 3 or 4 day course of treatment with Repository Corticotropin Injection USP and then retested. Suggested doses are 40 USP units twice daily for 4 days or 60 USP units twice daily for 3 days. Under these conditions little or no increase in plasma cortisol levels will be seen in Addison\u2019s disease whereas higher or even normal levels will be seen in cases with secondary adrenal insufficiency."], "generic_name": ["COSYNTROPIN"], "id": "15eaa42c-d1e7-5c08-e063-6394a90ae469", "route": ["INTRAMUSCULAR", "INTRAVENOUS"], "description": ["DESCRIPTION CORTROSYN \u00ae (cosyntropin) for Injection is a sterile lyophilized powder in vials containing 0.25 mg of CORTROSYN \u00ae and 10 mg of mannitol to be reconstituted with 1 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.

Paclitaxel exists in the particles in a non\u2011crystalline, amorphous state. Paclitaxel is a microtubule inhibitor. The chemical name for paclitaxel is 5\u03b2,20-Epoxy- 1,2\u03b1,4,7\u03b2,10\u03b2,13\u03b1-hexahydroxytax-11-en-9-one 4,10-diacetate 2-benzoate 13-ester with (2 R ,3 S )- N -benzoyl-3-phenylisoserine. The empirical formula is C 47 H 51 NO 14 and the molecular weight is 853.93. Paclitaxel has the following structural formula: Paclitaxel is a white to off-white crystalline powder.

Paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) is free of solvents. Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paclitaxel is a microtubule inhibitor that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. Paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or \"bundles\" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30 and 180-minute infusions of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/m 2 (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage) were determined in clinical studies. Dose levels of mg/m 2 refer to mg of paclitaxel in paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound). Following intravenous administration of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) to patients with solid tumors, paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner, the initial rapid decline representing distribution to the peripheral compartment and the slower second phase representing drug elimination. Following paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) infusion, paclitaxel exhibited linear drug exposure (AUC) across clinical doses ranging from 80 to 300 mg/m 2 (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage). The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) were independent of the duration of intravenous administration. The pharmacokinetic data of 260 mg/m 2 paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) administered over a 30-minute infusion was compared to the pharmacokinetics of 175 mg/m 2 paclitaxel injection over a 3-hour infusion. Clearance was larger (43%) and the volume of distribution was higher (53%) for paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) than for paclitaxel injection. There were no differences in terminal half-lives. Distribution Following paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) administration to patients with solid tumors, paclitaxel is evenly distributed into blood cells and plasma and is highly bound to plasma proteins (94%). The total volume of distribution is approximately 1741 L; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding of paclitaxel. In a within-patient comparison study, the fraction of unbound paclitaxel in plasma was significantly higher with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) (6.2%) than with solvent-based paclitaxel (2.3%). This contributes to significantly higher exposure to unbound paclitaxel with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) compared with solvent-based paclitaxel, when the total exposure is comparable. In vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins, using paclitaxel concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 \u03bcg/mL, indicated that the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel. Elimination At the clinical dose range of 80 to 300 mg/m 2 (0.31 to 1.15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage), the mean total clearance of paclitaxel ranges from 13 to 30 L/h/m 2 and the mean terminal half-life ranges from 13 to 27 hours. Metabolism In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices showed that paclitaxel in Paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) was metabolized primarily to 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel by CYP2C8; and to two minor metabolites, 3'\u2011 p \u2011hydroxypaclitaxel and 6\u03b1, 3'- p -dihydroxypaclitaxel, by CYP3A4. In vitro , the metabolism of paclitaxel to 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel was inhibited by a number of agents (ketoconazole, verapamil, diazepam, quinidine, dexamethasone, cyclosporin, teniposide, etoposide, and vincristine), but the concentrations used exceeded those found in vivo following normal therapeutic doses. Testosterone, 17\u03b1-ethinyl estradiol, retinoic acid, and quercetin, a specific inhibitor of CYP2C8, also inhibited the formation of 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel in vitro . The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel may also be altered in vivo as a result of interactions with compounds that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A4 [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Excretion After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg/m 2 doses of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound), the mean values for cumulative urinary recovery of unchanged drug (4%) indicated extensive non-renal clearance. Less than 1% of the total administered dose was excreted in urine as the metabolites 6\u03b1-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3'- p -hydroxypaclitaxel. Fecal excretion was approximately 20% of the total dose administered. Specific Populations No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) were observed based on body weight (40 to 143 kg), body surface area (1.3 to 2.4 m 2 ), sex, race (Asian vs. White), age (24 to 85 years), type of solid tumors, mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to <90 mL/min), and mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1 to \u22641.5 x ULN and AST \u226410 x ULN). Patients with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 x ULN and AST \u226410 x ULN) or severe (total bilirubin >3 to 5 x ULN) hepatic impairment had a 22% to 26% decrease in the maximum elimination rate of paclitaxel and approximately 20% increase in mean paclitaxel AUC compared with patients with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin \u2264ULN and AST \u2264ULN) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . The effect of severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) on the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Carboplatin: Administration of carboplatin immediately after the completion of the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) infusion to patients with NSCLC did not cause clinically meaningful changes in paclitaxel exposure.

The mean alpha half-life of mitoxantrone is 6 to 12 minutes, the mean beta half-life is 1.1 to 3.1 hours and the mean gamma (terminal or elimination) half-life is 23 to 215 hours (median approximately 75 hours). Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in humans receiving multiple daily dosing. Distribution to tissues is extensive: steady-state volume of distribution exceeds 1,000 L/m 2 . Tissue concentrations of mitoxantrone appear to exceed those in the blood during the terminal elimination phase. In the healthy monkey, distribution to brain, spinal cord, eye, and spinal fluid is low. In patients administered 15 to 90 mg/m 2 of mitoxantrone injection intravenously, there is a linear relationship between dose and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Mitoxantrone is 78% bound to plasma proteins in the observed concentration range of 26 to 455 ng/mL. This binding is independent of concentration and is not affected by the presence of phenytoin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, prednisone, prednisolone, heparin, or aspirin. Metabolism and Elimination Mitoxantrone is excreted in urine and feces as either unchanged drug or as inactive metabolites. In human studies, 11% and 25% of the dose were recovered in urine and feces, respectively, as either parent drug or metabolite during the 5 day period following drug administration. Of the material recovered in urine, 65% was unchanged drug. The remaining 35% was composed of monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acid derivatives and their glucuronide conjugates. The pathways leading to the metabolism of mitoxantrone injection have not been elucidated. Special Populations Gender The effect of gender on mitoxantrone pharmacokinetics is unknown. Geriatric In elderly patients with breast cancer, the systemic mitoxantrone clearance was 21.3 L/hr/m 2 , compared with 28.3 L/hr/m 2 and 16.2 L/hr/m 2 for non-elderly patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and malignant lymphoma, respectively. Pediatric Mitoxantrone pharmacokinetics in the pediatric population are unknown. Race The effect of race on mitoxantrone pharmacokinetics is unknown. Renal Impairment Mitoxantrone pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment are unknown. Hepatic Impairment Mitoxantrone clearance is reduced by hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic dysfunction (bilirubin > 3.4 mg/dL) have an AUC more than three times greater than that of patients with normal hepatic function receiving the same dose. Patients with multiple sclerosis who have hepatic impairment should ordinarily not be treated with mitoxantrone injection. Other patients with hepatic impairment should be treated with caution and dosage adjustment may be required. Drug Interactions In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that mitoxantrone did not inhibit CYP450 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 across a broad concentration range. The results of in vitro induction studies are inconclusive, but suggest that mitoxantrone may be a weak inducer of CYP450 2E1 activity. Pharmacokinetic studies of the interaction of mitoxantrone injection with concomitantly administered medications in humans have not been performed. The pathways leading to the metabolism of mitoxantrone injection have not been elucidated. To date, postmarketing experience has not revealed any significant drug interactions in patients who have received mitoxantrone injection for treatment of cancer.

Zoledronic acid is designated chemically as (1-Hydroxy-2-imidazol-1-yl-phosphonoethyl) phosphonic acid monohydrate and its structural formula is: Zoledronic acid monohydrate is a white crystalline powder. Its molecular formula is C 5 H 10 N 2 O 7 P 2 \u2022 H 2 O and a molar mass of 290.1 g/Mol. Zoledronic acid monohydrate is highly soluble in 0.1N sodium hydroxide solution, sparingly soluble in water and 0.1N hydrochloric acid, and practically insoluble in organic solvents. The pH of the Zoledronic Acid Injection solution for infusion is approximately 6.0 to 7.0. Zoledronic Acid Injection is available as a sterile solution in bags for intravenous infusion. One bag with 100 mL solution contains 5.330 mg of zoledronic acid monohydrate, equivalent to 5 mg zoledronic acid on an anhydrous basis. Inactive Ingredients : 4950 mg of mannitol, USP; and 30 mg of sodium citrate, USP. Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zoledronic Acid Injection is a bisphosphonate and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously administered zoledronic acid rapidly partitions to bone and localizes preferentially at sites of high bone turnover. The main molecular target of zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. The relatively long duration of action of zoledronic acid is attributable to its high binding affinity to bone mineral. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In the osteoporosis treatment trial, the effect of zoledronic acid injection treatment on markers of bone resorption (serum beta-C-telopeptides [b-CTx]) and bone formation (bone specific alkaline phosphatase [BSAP], serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen [P1NP]) was evaluated in patients (subsets ranging from 517 to 1246 patients) at periodic intervals. Treatment with a 5 mg annual dose of zoledronic acid injection reduces bone turnover markers to the pre-menopausal range with an approximate 55% reduction in b-CTx, a 29% reduction in BSAP and a 52% reduction in P1NP over 36 months. There was no progressive reduction of bone turnover markers with repeated annual dosing. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic data in patients with osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone are not available. Distribution: Single or multiple (every 28 days) 5-minute or 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 or 16 mg zoledronic acid were given to 64 patients with cancer and bone metastases. The post-infusion decline of zoledronic acid concentrations in plasma was consistent with a triphasic process showing a rapid decrease from peak concentrations at end-of-infusion to less than 1% of C max 24 hours post infusion with population half-lives of t 1/2\u03b1 0.24 hour and t 1/2\u03b2 1.87 hours for the early disposition phases of the drug. The terminal elimination phase of zoledronic acid was prolonged, with very low concentrations in plasma between Days 2 and 28 post infusion, and a terminal elimination half-life t 1/2\u03b3 of 146 hours. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC 0-24h ) of zoledronic acid was dose proportional from 2 to 16 mg. The accumulation of zoledronic acid measured over three cycles was low, with mean AUC 0-24h ratios for cycles 2 and 3 versus 1 of 1.13 \u00b1 0.30 and 1.16 \u00b1 0.36, respectively. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed low affinity of zoledronic acid for the cellular components of human blood. In vitro mean zoledronic acid protein binding in human plasma ranged from 28% at 200 ng/mL to 53% at 50 ng/mL. Metabolism: Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro . Zoledronic acid does not undergo biotransformation in vivo . In animal studies, less than 3% of the administered intravenous dose was found in the feces, with the balance either recovered in the urine or taken up by bone, indicating that the drug is eliminated intact via the kidney. Following an intravenous dose of 20 nCi 14 C-zoledronic acid in a patient with cancer and bone metastases, only a single radioactive species with chromatographic properties identical to those of parent drug was recovered in urine, which suggests that zoledronic acid is not metabolized. Excretion: In 64 patients with cancer and bone metastases on average (\u00b1 SD) 39 \u00b1 16% of the administered zoledronic acid dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours, with only trace amounts of drug found in urine post Day 2. The cumulative percent of drug excreted in the urine over 0 to 24 hours was independent of dose. The balance of drug not recovered in urine over 0 to 24 hours, representing drug presumably bound to bone, is slowly released back into the systemic circulation, giving rise to the observed prolonged low plasma concentrations. The 0 to 24 hour renal clearance of zoledronic acid was 3.7 \u00b1 2.0 L/h. Zoledronic acid clearance was independent of dose but dependent upon the patient's creatinine clearance. In a study in patients with cancer and bone metastases, increasing the infusion time of a 4 mg dose of zoledronic acid from 5 minutes (n = 5) to 15 minutes (n = 7) resulted in a 34% decrease in the zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion ([mean \u00b1 SD] 403 \u00b1 118 ng/mL vs. 264 \u00b1 86 ng/mL) and a 10% increase in the total AUC (378 \u00b1 116 ng \u00d7 h/mL vs. 420 \u00b1 218 ng \u00d7 h/mL). The difference between the AUC means was not statistically significant. Specific Populations Pediatrics: Zoledronic Acid Injection is not indicated for use in children [see Pediatric Use ( 8.4 )]. Geriatrics: The pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid was not affected by age in patients with cancer and bone metastases whose age ranged from 38 years to 84 years. Race: The pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid was not affected by race in patients with cancer and bone metastases. Hepatic Impairment: No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetic studies conducted in 64 cancer patients represented typical clinical populations with normal to moderately-impaired renal function. Compared to patients with creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/min (N = 37), patients with creatinine clearance = 50 to 80 mL/min (N = 15) showed an average increase in plasma AUC of 15%, whereas patients with creatinine clearance = 30 to 50 mL/min (N = 11) showed an average increase in plasma AUC of 43%. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with a creatinine clearance of greater than or equal to 35 mL/min. Zoledronic Acid Injection is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min and in those with evidence of acute renal impairment due to an increased risk of renal failure [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]."], "manufacturer_name": ["Sagent Pharmaceuticals"], "substance_name": ["ZOLEDRONIC ACID"], "effective_time": "20250311", "product_ndc": ["25021-830"], "brand_name": ["zoledronic acid"]}

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The iodine atoms in iohexol provide attenuation of X-rays in direct proportion to the concentration of iohexol. Since concentration changes over time, iohexol provides time-dependent image contrast which may assist in visualizing body structures. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Intrathecal Administration The initial concentration and volume of the contrast medium, in conjunction with patient manipulation and the volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into which the contrast medium is placed, will determine the extent of the contrast that can be achieved. Following intrathecal injection in conventional radiography, OMNIPAQUE 180 mg iodine/mL, 240 mg iodine/mL, and 300 mg iodine/mL will continue to provide contrast for at least 30 minutes. Slow diffusion of iohexol takes place throughout the CSF with subsequent absorption into the bloodstream. At approximately 1 hour following injection, contrast will no longer be sufficient for conventional myelography. After administration into the lumbar subarachnoid space, computerized tomography shows the presence of contrast medium in the thoracic region in about 1 hour, in the cervical region in about 2 hours, and in the basal cisterns in 3 to 4 hours. Intravenous or Intra-arterial Administration Following intravenous or intra-arterial administration of OMNIPAQUE, the degree of contrast enhancement is directly related to the iodine concentration of an administered dose; peak iodine blood concentrations occur immediately (15 seconds to 120 seconds) following rapid intravenous injection. The time to maximum contrast enhancement can vary, depending on the organ, from the time that peak blood iodine concentrations are reached to one hour after intravenous bolus administration. When a delay between peak blood iodine concentrations and peak contrast is present, it suggests that radiographic contrast enhancement is at least in part dependent on the accumulation of iodine containing agent within the lesion and outside the blood pool. Oral Administration Orally administered OMNIPAQUE produces visualization of the gastrointestinal tract. Less than 1% of orally administered iohexol is recovered in the urine, suggesting minimal amounts are absorbed from the normal gastrointestinal tract. This amount may increase in the presence of bowel perforation or bowel obstruction. Intraarticular Administration Visualization of the joint spaces can be accomplished by direct injection of contrast medium. For intraarticular cavities, the injected iohexol is absorbed into the surrounding tissue and subsequently absorbed into systemic circulation. Body Cavity Administration For most body cavities, the injected iohexol is absorbed into the surrounding tissue and subsequently absorbed into systemic circulation. Examinations of the uterus (hysterosalpingography) and bladder (voiding cystourethrography) involve the almost immediate drainage of contrast medium from the cavity upon conclusion of the radiographic procedure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the intravenous administration of iohexol (between 500 mg iodine/kg to 1,500 mg iodine/kg) to 16 adult subjects, apparent first-order terminal elimination half-life was 12.6 hours and total body clearance was 131 (98 to 165) mL/min. Clearance was not dose dependent. Absorption As evidenced by the amount recovered in urine, <1% of orally administered iohexol is absorbed from the normal gastrointestinal tract. This amount may increase in the presence of bowel perforation or bowel obstruction. Distribution In 16 adult subjects (receiving between 500 mg iodine/kg to 1,500 mg iodine/kg intravenous iohexol) the plasma volume of distribution was165 (108 to 219) mL/kg. In five adult patients receiving 16 mL to 18 mL of OMNIPAQUE (180 mg iodine/mL) by lumbar intrathecal injection the plasma volume of distribution was 559 (350 to 849) mL/kg. Elimination Metabolism No significant metabolism, deiodination or biotransformation occurs. Excretion Following intravenous, intra-arterial or intrathecal administration, iohexol is excreted unchanged by glomerular filtration.

It is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in acetonitrile and ethanol. 11.2 Lacosamide Injection Lacosamide Injection, USP is a clear, colorless, sterile solution containing 10 mg lacosamide per mL for intravenous infusion. One 20 mL vial contains 200 mg of lacosamide drug substance. The inactive ingredients are sodium chloride (7.6 mg/mL) and water for injection. Hydrochloric acid is used for pH adjustment. Lacosamide injection has a pH of 3.8 to 5.0. Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be fully elucidated. In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data from the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. Lacosamide exposure is correlated with the reduction in seizure frequency. However, doses above 400 mg/day do not appear to confer additional benefit in group analyses. Cardiac Electrophysiology Electrocardiographic effects of lacosamide were determined in a double-blind, randomized clinical pharmacology trial of 247 healthy subjects. Chronic oral doses of 400 and 800 mg/day (equal to and two times the maximum daily recommended dose, respectively) were compared with placebo and a positive control (400 mg moxifloxacin). Lacosamide did not prolong QTc interval and did not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. Lacosamide produced a small, dose-related increase in mean PR interval. At steady-state, the time of the maximum observed mean PR interval corresponded with t max . The placebo-subtracted maximum increase in PR interval (at t max ) was 7.3 ms for the 400 mg/day group and 11.9 ms for the 800 mg/day group. For patients who participated in the controlled trials, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum increase in PR interval for a 400 mg/day lacosamide dose was 3.1 ms in patients with partial-onset seizures and 9.4 ms for patients with diabetic neuropathy. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide have been studied in healthy adult subjects (age range 18 to 87), adults with partial-onset seizures, adults with diabetic neuropathy, and subjects with renal and hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide are similar in healthy subjects, patients with partial-onset seizures, and patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass effect with a high absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. The maximum lacosamide plasma concentrations occur approximately 1 to 4 hour post-dose after oral dosing, and elimination half-life is approximately 13 hours. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice daily repeated administration. Pharmacokinetics of lacosamide are dose proportional (100 to 800 mg) and time invariant, with low inter- and intra-subject variability. Compared to lacosamide the major metabolite, O-desmethyl metabolite, has a longer T max (0.5 to 12 hours) and elimination half-life (15 to 23 hours). Absorption and Bioavailability Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration. The oral bioavailability of lacosamide tablets is approximately 100%. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption. After intravenous administration, C max is reached at the end of infusion. The 30- and 60-minute intravenous infusions are bioequivalent to the oral tablet. For the 15-minute intravenous infusion, bioequivalence was met for AUC (0-tz) but not for C max . The point estimate of C max was 20% higher than C max for oral tablet and the 90% CI for C max exceeded the upper boundary of the bioequivalence range. In a trial comparing the oral tablet with an oral solution containing 10 mg/mL lacosamide, bioequivalence between both formulations was shown. A single loading dose of 200 mg approximates steady-state concentrations comparable to the 100 mg twice daily oral administration. Distribution The volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/kg and thus close to the volume of total body water. Lacosamide is less than 15% bound to plasma proteins. Metabolism and Elimination Lacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation. After oral and intravenous administration of 100 mg [14C]-lacosamide approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces. The major compounds excreted were unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose), its O-desmethyl metabolite (approximately 30%), and a structurally unknown polar fraction (~20%). The plasma exposure of the major human metabolite, O-desmethyl-lacosamide, is approximately 10% of that of lacosamide. This metabolite has no known pharmacological activity. The CYP isoforms mainly responsible for the formation of the major metabolite (O-desmethyl) are CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours and is not altered by different doses, multiple dosing or intravenous administration. There is no enantiomeric interconversion of lacosamide. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Lacosamide and its major metabolite are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion. The AUC of lacosamide was increased approximately 25% in mildly (CL CR 50 to 80 mL/min) and moderately (CL CR 30 to 50 mL/min) and 60% in severely (CL CR \u226430 mL/min) renally impaired patients compared to subjects with normal renal function (CL CR >80 mL/min), whereas C max was unaffected. Lacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis. Following a 4-hour hemodialysis treatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50% [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Hepatic Impairment Lacosamide undergoes metabolism. Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of lacosamide (approximately 50-60% higher AUC compared to healthy subjects). The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide have not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Pediatric Patients (4 Years to less than 17 Years of Age) The pediatric pharmacokinetic profile of lacosamide was determined in a population pharmacokinetic analysis using sparse plasma concentration data obtained in two open-label studies in 79 pediatric patients with partial-onset seizures that included patients 4 years to less than 17 years of age. Both apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution increase as body weight increases. For patients weighing 11 kg, 28.9 kg (the mean population body weight), and 70 kg, the typical plasma half-life (t 1/2 ) is 7.4 hours, 10.6 hours, and 14.8 hours, respectively. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice daily repeated administration. A weight based dosing regimen is necessary to achieve lacosamide exposures in pediatric patients 4 years to less than 17 years of age similar to those observed in adults treated at effective doses of lacosamide [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide in pediatric patients are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures and as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Pediatric use information is approved for UCB, Inc.'s VIMPAT \u00ae (lacosamide) injection. However, due to UCB, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Geriatric Patients In the elderly (>65 years), dose and body-weight normalized AUC and C max is about 20% increased compared to young subjects (18 to 64 years). This may be related to body weight and decreased renal function in elderly subjects. Gender Lacosamide clinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically relevant influence on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide. Race There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide between Asian, Black, and Caucasian subjects. CYP2C19 Polymorphism There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide between CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers. Results from a trial in poor metabolizers (PM) (N=4) and extensive metabolizers (EM) (N=8) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 showed that lacosamide plasma concentrations were similar in PMs and EMs, but plasma concentrations and the amount excreted into urine of the O-desmethyl metabolite were about 70% reduced in PMs compared to EMs. Drug Interactions In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In vitro metabolism studies indicate that lacosamide does not induce the enzyme activity of drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4. Lacosamide did not inhibit CYP 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5 at plasma concentrations observed in clinical studies. In vitro data suggest that lacosamide has the potential to inhibit CYP2C19 at therapeutic concentrations. However, an in vivo study with omeprazole did not show an inhibitory effect on omeprazole pharmacokinetics. Lacosamide was not a substrate or inhibitor for P-glycoprotein. Lacosamide is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have increased exposure to lacosamide. Since <15% of lacosamide is bound to plasma proteins, a clinically relevant interaction with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites is unlikely. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with AEDs \u25cb Effect of lacosamide on concomitant AEDs Lacosamide 400 mg/day had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of 600 mg/day valproic acid and 400 mg/day carbamazepine in healthy subjects. The placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients with partial-onset seizures showed that steady-state plasma concentrations of levetiracetam, carbamazepine, carbamazepine epoxide, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine monohydroxy derivative (MHD), phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, gabapentin, clonazepam, and zonisamide were not affected by concomitant intake of lacosamide at any dose. \u25cb Effect of concomitant AEDs on lacosamide Drug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects showed that 600 mg/day valproic acid had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of 400 mg/day lacosamide. Likewise, 400 mg/day carbamazepine had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide in a healthy subject study. Population pharmacokinetics results in patients with partial-onset seizures showed small reductions (15% to 20% lower) in lacosamide plasma concentrations when lacosamide was coadministered with carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin. Drug-drug interaction studies with other drugs \u25cb Digoxin There was no effect of lacosamide (400 mg/day) on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.5 mg once daily) in a study in healthy subjects. \u25cb Metformin There were no clinically relevant changes in metformin levels following coadministration of lacosamide (400 mg/day). Metformin (500 mg three times a day) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide (400 mg/day). \u25cb Omeprazole Omeprazole is a CYP2C19 substrate and inhibitor. There was no effect of lacosamide (600 mg/day) on the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole (40 mg single dose) in healthy subjects. The data indicated that lacosamide had little in vivo inhibitory or inducing effect on CYP2C19. Omeprazole at a dose of 40 mg once daily had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide (300 mg single dose). However, plasma levels of the O-desmethyl metabolite were reduced about 60% in the presence of omeprazole. \u25cb Midazolam Midazolam is a 3A4 substrate. There was no effect of lacosamide (200 mg single dose or repeat doses of 400 mg/day given as 200 mg BID) on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (single dose, 7.5 mg), indicating no inhibitory or inducing effects on CYP3A4. \u25cb Oral Contraceptives There was no influence of lacosamide (400 mg/day) on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel in healthy subjects, except that a 20% increase in ethinylestradiol C max was observed. \u25cb Warfarin Coadministration of lacosamide (400 mg/day) with warfarin (25 mg single dose) did not result in a clinically relevant change in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin in a study in healthy male subjects."], "manufacturer_name": ["Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc."], "substance_name": ["LACOSAMIDE"], "effective_time": "20241206", "product_ndc": ["70710-1886"], "brand_name": ["LACOSAMIDE"]}

Ranitidine hydrochloride does not lower serum Ca++ in hypercalcemic states. Ranitidine hydrochloride is not an anticholinergic agent. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Ranitidine hydrochloride is absorbed very rapidly after intramuscular (IM) injection. Mean peak levels of 576 ng/mL occur within 15 minutes or less following a 50 mg IM dose. Absorption from IM sites is virtually complete, with a bioavailability of 90% to 100% compared with intravenous (IV) administration. Following oral administration, the bioavailability of ranitidine is 50%. Distribution The volume of distribution is about 1.4 L/kg. Serum protein binding averages 15%. Metabolism In humans, the N-oxide is the principal metabolite in the urine; however, this amounts to <4% of the dose. Other metabolites are the S-oxide (1%) and the desmethyl ranitidine (1%). The remainder of the administered dose is found in the stool. Studies in patients with hepatic dysfunction (compensated cirrhosis) indicate that there are minor, but clinically insignificant, alterations in ranitidine half-life, distribution, clearance, and bioavailability. Excretion Following IV injection, approximately 70% of the dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug. Renal clearance averages 530 mL/min, with a total clearance of 760 mL/min. The elimination half-life is 2.0 to 2.5 hours. Four patients with clinically significant renal function impairment (creatinine clearance 25 to 35 mL/min) administered 50 mg of ranitidine intravenously had an average plasma half-life of 4.8 hours, a ranitidine clearance of 29 mL/min, and a volume of distribution of 1.76 L/kg. In general, these parameters appear to be altered in proportion to creatinine clearance (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Geriatrics The plasma half-life is prolonged and total clearance is reduced in the elderly population due to a decrease in renal function. The elimination half-life is 3.1 hours (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dosage Adjustment for Patients With Impaired Renal Function ). Pediatrics There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameter values for ranitidine in pediatric patients (from 1 month up to 16 years of age) and healthy adults when correction is made for body weight. The pharmacokinetics of ranitidine hydrochloride in pediatric patients are summarized in Table 1.

The elimination half-life in neonates averaged 6.6 hours as compared to approximately 2 hours in adults and pediatric patients. Pharmacodynamics Serum concentrations necessary to inhibit 50% of stimulated gastric acid secretion are estimated to be 36 to 94 ng/mL. Following single IV or IM 50 mg doses, serum concentrations of ranitidine are in this range for 6 to 8 hours. Antisecretory Activity 1. Effects on Acid Secretion Ranitidine injection inhibits basal gastric acid secretion as well as gastric acid secretion stimulated by betazole and pentagastrin, as shown in Table 2.

It appears that basal- and betazole-stimulated secretions are most sensitive to inhibition by ranitidine hydrochloride, while pentagastrin-stimulated secretion is more difficult to suppress. 2. Effects on Other Gastrointestinal Secretions Pepsin Ranitidine hydrochloride does not affect pepsin secretion. Total pepsin output is reduced in proportion to the decrease in volume of gastric juice. Intrinsic Factor Ranitidine hydrochloride has no significant effect on pentagastrin-stimulated intrinsic factor secretion. Serum Gastrin Ranitidine hydrochloride has little or no effect on fasting or postprandial serum gastrin. Other Pharmacologic Actions Gastric bacterial flora\u2015increase in nitrate-reducing organisms, significance not known.

No antiandrogenic action. No effect on count, motility, or morphology of sperm. Pediatrics The ranitidine concentration necessary to suppress basal acid secretion by at least 90% has been reported to be 40 to 60 ng/mL in pediatric patients with duodenal or gastric ulcers. In a study of 20 critically ill pediatric patients receiving ranitidine IV at 1 mg/kg every 6 hours, 10 patients with a baseline pH \u22654 maintained this baseline throughout the study. Eight of the remaining 10 patients with a baseline of pH \u22642 achieved pH \u22654 throughout varying periods after dosing. It should be noted, however, that because these pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed in critically ill pediatric patients, the data should be interpreted with caution when dosing recommendations are made for a less seriously ill pediatric population. In another small study of neonatal patients (n = 5) receiving ECMO, gastric pH <4 pretreatment increased to >4 after a 2-mg/kg dose and remained above 4 for at least 15 hours. Clinical Trials Active Duodenal Ulcer In a multicenter, double-blind, controlled, US study of endoscopically diagnosed duodenal ulcers, earlier healing was seen in the patients treated with oral ranitidine hydrochloride as shown in Table 3.

Inactive Ingredients : 4950 mg of mannitol, USP; and 30 mg of sodium citrate, USP. zoledronic01"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zoledronic acid injection is a bisphosphonate and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously administered zoledronic acid rapidly partitions to bone and localizes preferentially at sites of high bone turnover. The main molecular target of zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. The relatively long duration of action of zoledronic acid is attributable to its high binding affinity to bone mineral. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In the osteoporosis treatment trial, the effect of zoledronic acid injection treatment on markers of bone resorption (serum beta-C-telopeptides [b-CTx]) and bone formation (bone specific alkaline phosphatase [BSAP], serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen [P1NP]) was evaluated in patients (subsets ranging from 517 to 1246 patients) at periodic intervals. Treatment with a 5 mg annual dose of zoledronic acid injection reduces bone turnover markers to the pre-menopausal range with an approximate 55% reduction in b-CTx, a 29% reduction in BSAP and a 52% reduction in P1NP over 36 months. There was no progressive reduction of bone turnover markers with repeated annual dosing. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic data in patients with osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone are not available. D istribution: Single or multiple (q 28 days) 5-minute or 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 or 16 mg zoledronic acid were given to 64 patients with cancer and bone metastases. The post-infusion decline of zoledronic acid concentrations in plasma was consistent with a triphasic process showing a rapid decrease from peak concentrations at end-of-infusion to less than 1% of C max 24 hours post infusion with population half-lives of t 1/2\u03b1 0.24 hour and t 1/2\u03b2 1.87 hours for the early disposition phases of the drug. The terminal elimination phase of zoledronic acid was prolonged, with very low concentrations in plasma between Days 2 and 28 post infusion, and a terminal elimination half-life t 1/2\u03b3 of 146 hours. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC 0 to 24h ) of zoledronic acid was dose proportional from 2 to 16 mg. The accumulation of zoledronic acid measured over three cycles was low, with mean AUC 0 to 24h ratios for cycles 2 and 3 versus 1 of 1.13 \u00b1 0.30 and 1.16 \u00b1 0.36, respectively. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed low affinity of zoledronic acid for the cellular components of human blood. In vitro mean zoledronic acid protein binding in human plasma ranged from 28% at 200 ng/mL to 53% at 50 ng/mL. Metabolism: Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro . Zoledronic acid does not undergo biotransformation in vivo . In animal studies, less than 3% of the administered intravenous dose was found in the feces, with the balance either recovered in the urine or taken up by bone, indicating that the drug is eliminated intact via the kidney. Following an intravenous dose of 20 nCi 14 C-zoledronic acid in a patient with cancer and bone metastases, only a single radioactive species with chromatographic properties identical to those of parent drug was recovered in urine, which suggests that zoledronic acid is not metabolized. Excretion: In 64 patients with cancer and bone metastases on average (\u00b1 SD) 39 \u00b1 16% of the administered zoledronic acid dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours, with only trace amounts of drug found in urine post Day 2. The cumulative percent of drug excreted in the urine over 0 to 24 hours was independent of dose. The balance of drug not recovered in urine over 0 to 24 hours, representing drug presumably bound to bone, is slowly released back into the systemic circulation, giving rise to the observed prolonged low plasma concentrations. The 0 to 24 hour renal clearance of zoledronic acid was 3.7 \u00b1 2.0 L/h. Zoledronic acid clearance was independent of dose but dependent upon the patient\u2019s creatinine clearance. In a study in patients with cancer and bone metastases, increasing the infusion time of a 4 mg dose of zoledronic acid from 5 minutes (n=5) to 15 minutes (n=7) resulted in a 34% decrease in the zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion ([mean \u00b1 SD] 403 \u00b1 118 ng/mL vs. 264 \u00b1 86 ng/mL) and a 10% increase in the total AUC (378 \u00b1 116 ng x h/mL vs. 420 \u00b1 218 ng x h/mL). The difference between the AUC means was not statistically significant. Specific Populations Pediatrics: Zoledronic acid is not indicated for use in children [ see Pediatric Use (8.4) ]. Geriatrics: The pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid was not affected by age in patients with cancer and bone metastases whose age ranged from 38 years to 84 years. Race: The pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid was not affected by race in patients with cancer and bone metastases. Hepatic Impairment: No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetic studies conducted in 64 cancer patients represented typical clinical populations with normal to moderately-impaired renal function. Compared to patients with creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/min (N=37), patients with creatinine clearance = 50 to 80 mL/min (N=15) showed an average increase in plasma AUC of 15%, whereas patients with creatinine clearance = 30 to 50 mL/min (N=11) showed an average increase in plasma AUC of 43%. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with a creatinine clearance of greater than or equal to 35 mL/min.

Ampicillin serum levels are similar to those produced by the administration of equivalent amounts of ampicillin alone. Peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 109 to 150 mcg/mL are attained after administration of 2,000 mg of ampicillin plus 1,000 mg sulbactam and 40 to 71 mcg/mL after administration of 1,000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam. The corresponding mean peak serum levels for sulbactam range from 48 to 88 mcg/mL and 21 to 40 mcg/mL, respectively. After an intramuscular injection of 1,000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam, peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 8 to 37 mcg/mL and peak sulbactam serum levels ranging from 6 to 24 mcg/mL are attained. The mean serum half-life of both drugs is approximately 1 hour in healthy volunteers. Approximately 75 to 85% of both ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted unchanged in the urine during the first 8 hours after administration of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection to individuals with normal renal function. Somewhat higher and more prolonged serum levels of ampicillin and sulbactam can be achieved with the concurrent administration of probenecid. In patients with impaired renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION section). Ampicillin has been found to be approximately 28% reversibly bound to human serum protein and sulbactam approximately 38% reversibly bound. The following average levels of ampicillin and sulbactam were measured in the tissues and fluids listed: TABLE 1 Concentration of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in Various Body Tissues and Fluids Fluid or Tissue Dose (grams) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Concentration (mcg/mL or mcg/g) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Peritoneal Fluid 0.5/0.5 IV 7/14 Blister Fluid (Cantharides) 0.5/0.5 IV 8/20 Tissue Fluid 1/0.5 IV 8/4 Intestinal Mucosa 0.5/0.5 IV 11/18 Appendix 2/1 IV 3/40 Penetration of both ampicillin and sulbactam into cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of inflamed meninges has been demonstrated after IV administration of ampicillin and sulbactam. The pharmacokinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam in pediatric patients receiving ampicillin and sulbactam are similar to those observed in adults. Immediately after a 15-minute infusion of 50 to 75 mg ampicillin and sulbactam/kg body weight, peak serum and plasma concentrations of 82 to 446 mcg ampicillin/mL and 44 to 203 mcg sulbactam/mL were obtained. Mean half-life values were approximately 1 hour. MICROBIOLOGY Ampicillin is similar to benzyl penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible organisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall mucopeptide biosynthesis. Ampicillin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. (Ampicillin is, however, degraded by beta-lactamases and therefore the spectrum of activity does not normally include organisms which produce these enzymes). A wide range of beta-lactamases found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins have been shown in biochemical studies with cell free bacterial systems to be irreversibly inhibited by sulbactam. Although sulbactam alone possesses little useful antibacterial activity except against the Neisseriaceae , whole organism studies have shown that sulbactam restores ampicillin activity against beta-lactamase producing strains. In particular, sulbactam has good inhibitory activity against the clinically important plasmid mediated beta-lactamases most frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance. Sulbactam has no effect on the activity of ampicillin against ampicillin susceptible strains. The presence of sulbactam in the ampicillin and sulbactam for injection formulation effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of ampicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to it and to other beta-lactam antibacterials. Thus, ampicillin and sulbactam for injection possesses the properties of a broad-spectrum antibacterial and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. While in vitro studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following organisms, clinical efficacy for infections other than those included in the INDICATIONS and USAGE section has not been documented. Gram-Positive Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing), Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing), Streptococcus faecalis \u2020 (Enterococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae \u2020 (formerly D. pneumoniae ), Streptococcus pyogenes \u2020 , Streptococcus viridans \u2020 .

A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of patient data from 6 of these 10 clinical trials (N = 280) could not detect a positive association between mean, maximum or minimum plasma voriconazole concentration and efficacy. However, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses of the data from all 10 clinical trials identified positive associations between plasma voriconazole concentrations and rate of both liver function test abnormalities and visual disturbances [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Cardiac Electrophysiology A placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study to evaluate the effect on the QT interval of healthy male and female subjects was conducted with three single oral doses of voriconazole and ketoconazole. Serial ECGs and plasma samples were obtained at specified intervals over a 24-hour post dose observation period. The placebo-adjusted mean maximum increases in QTc from baseline after 800, 1,200, and 1,600 mg of voriconazole and after ketoconazole 800 mg were all <10 msec. Females exhibited a greater increase in QTc than males, although all mean changes were <10 msec. Age was not found to affect the magnitude of increase in QTc. No subject in any group had an increase in QTc of \u226560 msec from baseline. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec. However, the QT effect of voriconazole combined with drugs known to prolong the QT interval is unknown [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of voriconazole have been characterized in healthy subjects, special populations and patients. The pharmacokinetics of voriconazole are non-linear due to saturation of its metabolism. The interindividual variability of voriconazole pharmacokinetics is high. Greater than proportional increase in exposure is observed with increasing dose. It is estimated that, on average, increasing the oral dose from 200 mg every 12 hours to 300 mg every 12 hours leads to an approximately 2.5-fold increase in exposure (AUC \u03c4 ); similarly, increasing the intravenous dose from 3 mg/kg every 12 hours to 4 mg/kg every 12 hours produces an approximately 2.5-fold increase in exposure (Table 12).

CV = coefficient of variation 6 mg/kg IV (loading dose) 3 mg/kg IV every 12 hours 4 mg/kg IV every 12 hours 400 mg Oral (loading dose) 200 mg Oral every 12 hours 300 mg Oral every 12 hours N 35 23 40 17 48 16 AUC 12 (mcg.h/mL) 13.9 (32) 13.7 (53) 33.9 (54) 9.31 (38) 12.4 (78) 34.0 (53) C max (mcg/mL) 3.13 (20) 3.03 (25) 4.77 (36) 2.30 (19) 2.31 (48) 4.74 (35) C min (mcg/mL) -- 0.46 (97) 1.73 (74) -- 0.46 (120) 1.63 (79) When the recommended intravenous loading dose regimen is administered to healthy subjects, plasma concentrations close to steady state are achieved within the first 24 hours of dosing (e.g., 6 mg/kg IV every 12 hours on day 1 followed by 3 mg/kg IV every 12 hours). Without the loading dose, accumulation occurs during twice daily multiple dosing with steady state plasma voriconazole concentrations being achieved by day 6 in the majority of subjects. Absorption The pharmacokinetic properties of voriconazole are similar following administration by the intravenous and oral routes. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled data in healthy subjects (N = 207), the oral bioavailability of voriconazole is estimated to be 96% (CV 13%). Bioequivalence was established between the 200 mg tablet and the 40 mg/mL oral suspension when administered as a 400 mg every 12 hours loading dose followed by a 200 mg every 12 hours maintenance dose. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved 1 to 2 hours after dosing. When multiple doses of voriconazole are administered with high-fat meals, the mean C max and AUC \u03c4 are reduced by 34% and 24%, respectively when administered as a tablet and by 58% and 37% respectively when administered as the oral suspension [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . In healthy subjects, the absorption of voriconazole is not affected by coadministration of oral ranitidine, cimetidine, or omeprazole, drugs that are known to increase gastric pH. Distribution The volume of distribution at steady state for voriconazole is estimated to be 4.6 L/kg, suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Plasma protein binding is estimated to be 58% and was shown to be independent of plasma concentrations achieved following single and multiple oral doses of 200 mg or 300 mg (approximate range: 0.9 to 15 mcg/mL). Varying degrees of hepatic and renal impairment do not affect the protein binding of voriconazole. Elimination Metabolism In vitro studies showed that voriconazole is metabolized by the human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vivo studies indicated that CYP2C19 is significantly involved in the metabolism of voriconazole. This enzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The major metabolite of voriconazole is the N-oxide, which accounts for 72% of the circulating radiolabelled metabolites in plasma. Since this metabolite has minimal antifungal activity, it does not contribute to the overall efficacy of voriconazole. Excretion Voriconazole is eliminated via hepatic metabolism with less than 2% of the dose excreted unchanged in the urine. After administration of a single radiolabelled dose of either oral or IV voriconazole, preceded by multiple oral or IV dosing, approximately 80% to 83% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine. The majority (>94%) of the total radioactivity is excreted in the first 96 hours after both oral and intravenous dosing. As a result of non-linear pharmacokinetics, the terminal half-life of voriconazole is dose dependent and therefore not useful in predicting the accumulation or elimination of voriconazole. Specific Populations Male and Female Patients In a multiple oral dose study, the mean C max and AUC \u03c4 for healthy young females were 83% and 113% higher, respectively, than in healthy young males (18 to 45 years), after tablet dosing. In the same study, no significant differences in the mean C max and AUC \u03c4 were observed between healthy elderly males and healthy elderly females (>65 years). In a similar study, after dosing with the oral suspension, the mean AUC for healthy young females was 45% higher than in healthy young males whereas the mean C max was comparable between genders. The steady state trough voriconazole concentrations (C min ) seen in females were 100% and 91% higher than in males receiving the tablet and the oral suspension, respectively. In the clinical program, no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of gender. The safety profile and plasma concentrations observed in male and female subjects were similar. Therefore, no dosage adjustment based on gender is necessary. Geriatric Patients In an oral multiple dose study the mean C max and AUC \u03c4 in healthy elderly males (\u226565 years) were 61% and 86% higher, respectively, than in young males (18 to 45 years). No significant differences in the mean C max and AUC \u03c4 were observed between healthy elderly females (\u226565 years) and healthy young females (18 to 45 years). In the clinical program, no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of age. An analysis of pharmacokinetic data obtained from 552 patients from 10 voriconazole clinical trials showed that the median voriconazole plasma concentrations in the elderly patients (>65 years) were approximately 80% to 90% higher than those in the younger patients (\u226465 years) after either IV or oral administration. However, the safety profile of voriconazole in young and elderly subjects was similar and, therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly [see Use in Special Populations (8.5) ] . Pediatric Patients The recommended doses in pediatric patients were based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data obtained from 112 immunocompromised pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years and 26 immunocompromised pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 17 years. A comparison of the pediatric and adult population pharmacokinetic data indicated that the predicted total exposure (AUC 12 ) in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years following administration of a 9 mg/kg intravenous loading dose was comparable to that in adults following a 6 mg/kg intravenous loading dose. The predicted total exposures in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years following intravenous maintenance doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg twice daily were comparable to those in adults following 3 and 4 mg/kg IV twice daily, respectively. The predicted total exposure in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years following an oral maintenance dose of 9 mg/kg (maximum of 350 mg) twice daily was comparable to that in adults following 200 mg oral twice daily. An 8 mg/kg intravenous dose will provide voriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a 9 mg/kg oral dose in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years. Voriconazole exposures in the majority of pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 17 years were comparable to those in adults receiving the same dosing regimens. However, lower voriconazole exposure was observed in some pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 17 years with low body weight compared to adults [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Limited voriconazole trough plasma samples were collected in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years with IA or invasive candidiasis including candidemia, and EC in two prospective, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter clinical studies. In eleven pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years and aged 12 to 14 years, with body weight less than 50 kg, who received 9 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours as a loading dose on the first day of treatment, followed by 8 mg/kg every 12 hours as an intravenous maintenance dose, or 9 mg/kg every 12 hours as an oral maintenance dose, the mean trough concentration of voriconazole was 3.6 mcg/mL (range 0.3 to 10.7 mcg/mL). In four pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 years and aged 12 to 14 years, with body weight less than 50 kg, who received 4 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours, the mean trough concentration of voriconazole was 0.9 mcg/mL (range 0.3 to 1.6 mcg/mL) [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose (200 mg) of voriconazole in 8 patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) and 4 patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, the mean systemic exposure (AUC) was 3.2-fold higher than in age and weight matched controls with normal hepatic function. There was no difference in mean peak plasma concentrations (C max ) between the groups. When only the patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment were compared to controls, there was still a 2.3-fold increase in the mean AUC in the group with hepatic impairment compared to controls. In an oral multiple dose study, AUC \u03c4 was similar in 6 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) given a lower maintenance dose of 100 mg twice daily compared to 6 subjects with normal hepatic function given the standard 200 mg twice daily maintenance dose. The mean peak plasma concentrations (C max ) were 20% lower in the hepatically impaired group. No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment In a single oral dose (200 mg) study in 24 subjects with normal renal function and mild to severe renal impairment, systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (C max ) of voriconazole were not significantly affected by renal impairment. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for oral dosing in patients with mild to severe renal impairment. In a multiple dose study of IV voriconazole (6 mg/kg IV loading dose x 2, then 3 mg/kg IV x 5.5 days) in 7 patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min), the systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (C max ) were not significantly different from those in 6 subjects with normal renal function. However, in patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. The mean systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of SBECD were increased 4-fold and almost 50%, respectively, in the moderately impaired group compared to the normal control group. A pharmacokinetic study in subjects with renal failure undergoing hemodialysis showed that voriconazole is dialyzed with clearance of 121 mL/min. The intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is hemodialyzed with clearance of 55 mL/min. A 4-hour hemodialysis session does not remove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Patients at Risk of Aspergillosis The observed voriconazole pharmacokinetics in patients at risk of aspergillosis (mainly patients with malignant neoplasms of lymphatic or hematopoietic tissue) were similar to healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Effects of Other Drugs on Voriconazole Voriconazole is metabolized by the human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Results of in vitro metabolism studies indicate that the affinity of voriconazole is highest for CYP2C19, followed by CYP2C9, and is appreciably lower for CYP3A4. Inhibitors or inducers of these three enzymes may increase or decrease voriconazole systemic exposure (plasma concentrations), respectively. The systemic exposure to voriconazole is significantly reduced by the concomitant administration of the following agents and their use is contraindicated: Rifampin (potent CYP450 inducer)- Rifampin (600 mg once daily) decreased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of voriconazole (200 mg every 12 hours x 7 days) by an average of 93% and 96%, respectively, in healthy subjects. Doubling the dose of voriconazole to 400 mg every 12 hours does not restore adequate exposure to voriconazole during coadministration with rifampin [see Contraindications (4) ] . Ritonavir (potent CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate)- The effect of the coadministration of voriconazole and ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg) was investigated in two separate studies. High-dose ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours for 9 days) decreased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 8 days) by an average of 66% and 82%, respectively, in healthy subjects. Low-dose ritonavir (100 mg every 12 hours for 9 days) decreased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 8 days) by an average of 24% and 39%, respectively , in healthy subjects. Although repeat oral administration of voriconazole did not have a significant effect on steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of high-dose ritonavir in healthy subjects, steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of low-dose ritonavir decreased slightly by 24% and 14% respectively, when administered concomitantly with oral voriconazole in healthy subjects [see Contraindications (4) ] . St. John's Wort (CYP450 inducer; P-gp inducer) -In an independent published study in healthy volunteers who were given multiple oral doses of St. John's Wort (300 mg LI 160 extract three times daily for 15 days) followed by a single 400 mg oral dose of voriconazole, a 59% decrease in mean voriconazole AUC 0-\u221e was observed. In contrast, coadministration of single oral doses of St. John's Wort and voriconazole had no appreciable effect on voriconazole AUC 0-\u221e . Long-term use of St. John's Wort could lead to reduced voriconazole exposure [see Contraindications (4) ] . Significant drug interactions that may require voriconazole dosage adjustment, or frequent monitoring of voriconazole-related adverse reactions/toxicity: Fluconazole (CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor): Concurrent administration of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 2.5 days) and oral fluconazole (400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg every 24 hours for 4 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in an increase in C max and AUC \u03c4 of voriconazole by an average of 57% (90% CI: 20%, 107%) and 79% (90% CI: 40%, 128%), respectively. In a follow-on clinical study involving 8 healthy male subjects, reduced dosing and/or frequency of voriconazole and fluconazole did not eliminate or diminish this effect [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Letermovir (CYP2C9/2C19 inducer) -Coadministration of oral letermovir with oral voriconazole decreased the steady state C max and AUC 0-12 of voriconazole by an average of 39% and 44%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . M inor or no significant pharmacokinetic interactions that do not require dosage adjustment: Cimetidine (non-specific CYP450 inhibitor and increases gastric pH)- Cimetidine (400 mg every 12 hours x 8 days) increased voriconazole steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 by an average of 18% (90% CI: 6%, 32%) and 23% (90% CI: 13%, 33%), respectively, following oral doses of 200 mg every 12 hours x 7 days to healthy subjects. Ranitidine (increases gastric pH)- Ranitidine (150 mg every 12 hours) had no significant effect on voriconazole C max and AUC \u03c4 following oral doses of 200 mg every 12 hours x 7 days to healthy subjects. Macrolide antibiotics- Coadministration of erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitor; 1 gram every 12 hours for 7 days) or azithromycin (500 mg every 24 hours for 3 days) with voriconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 14 days had no significant effect on voriconazole steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 in healthy subjects. The effects of voriconazole on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or azithromycin are not known. Effects of Voriconazole on Other Drugs In vitro studies with human hepatic microsomes show that voriconazole inhibits the metabolic activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. In these studies, the inhibition potency of voriconazole for CYP3A4 metabolic activity was significantly less than that of two other azoles, ketoconazole and itraconazole. In vitro studies also show that the major metabolite of voriconazole, voriconazole N-oxide, inhibits the metabolic activity of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to a greater extent than that of CYP2C19. Therefore, there is potential for voriconazole and its major metabolite to increase the systemic exposure (plasma concentrations) of other drugs metabolized by these CYP450 enzymes. The systemic exposure of the following drug is significantly increased by coadministration of voriconazole and their use is contraindicated: Sirolimus (CYP3A4 substrate)- Repeat dose administration of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 8 days) increased the C max and AUC of sirolimus (2 mg single dose) an average of 7-fold (90% CI: 5.7, 7.5) and 11-fold (90% CI: 9.9, 12.6), respectively, in healthy male subjects [see Contraindications (4) ] . Coadministration of voriconazole with the following agents results in increased exposure to these drugs. Therefore, careful monitoring and/or dosage adjustment of these drugs is needed: Alfentanil (CYP3A4 substrate) - Coadministration of multiple doses of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on day 1, 200 mg every 12 hours on day 2) with a single 20 mcg/kg intravenous dose of alfentanil with concomitant naloxone resulted in a 6-fold increase in mean alfentanil AUC 0-\u221e and a 4-fold prolongation of mean alfentanil elimination half-life, compared to when alfentanil was given alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Fentanyl (CYP3A4 substrate): In an independent published study, concomitant use of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, then 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2) with a single intravenous dose of fentanyl (5 mcg/kg) resulted in an increase in the mean AUC 0-\u221e of fentanyl by 1.4-fold (range 0.81- to 2.04-fold) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Oxycodone (CYP3A4 substrate): In an independent published study, coadministration of multiple doses of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours, on Day 1 followed by five doses of 200 mg every 12 hours on Days 2 to 4) with a single 10 mg oral dose of oxycodone on Day 3 resulted in an increase in the mean C max and AUC 0\u2013\u221e of oxycodone by 1.7-fold (range 1.4- to 2.2-fold) and 3.6-fold (range 2.7- to 5.6-fold), respectively. The mean elimination half-life of oxycodone was also increased by 2.0-fold (range 1.4- to 2.5-fold) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Cyclosporine (CYP3A4 substrate)- In stable renal transplant recipients receiving chronic cyclosporine therapy, concomitant administration of oral voriconazole (200 mg every 12 hours for 8 days) increased cyclosporine C max and AUC \u03c4 an average of 1.1 times (90% CI: 0.9, 1.41) and 1.7 times (90% CI: 1.5, 2.0), respectively, as compared to when cyclosporine was administered without voriconazole [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Methadone (CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 substrate) -Repeat dose administration of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 4 days) increased the C max and AUC \u03c4 of pharmacologically active R-methadone by 31% (90% CI: 22%, 40%) and 47% (90% CI: 38%, 57%), respectively, in subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (30 to 100 mg every 24 hours). The C max and AUC of (S)-methadone increased by 65% (90% CI: 53%, 79%) and 103% (90% CI: 85%, 124%), respectively [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Tacrolimus (CYP3A4 substrate) -Repeat oral dose administration of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours x 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours x 6 days) increased tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg single dose) C max and AUC \u03c4 in healthy subjects by an average of 2-fold (90% CI: 1.9, 2.5) and 3-fold (90% CI: 2.7, 3.8), respectively [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) -Coadministration of voriconazole (300 mg every 12 hours x 12 days) with warfarin (30 mg single dose) significantly increased maximum prothrombin time by approximately 2 times that of placebo in healthy subjects [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs; CYP2C9 substrates): In two independent published studies, single doses of ibuprofen (400 mg) and diclofenac (50 mg) were coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2). Voriconazole increased the mean C max and AUC of the pharmacologically active isomer, S (+)-ibuprofen by 20% and 100%, respectively. Voriconazole increased the mean C max and AUC of diclofenac by 114% and 78%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . No significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed when voriconazole was coadministered with the following agents. Therefore, no dosage adjustment for these agents is recommended: Prednisolone (CYP3A4 substrate)- Voriconazole (200 mg every 12 hours x 30 days) increased C max and AUC of prednisolone (60 mg single dose) by an average of 11% and 34%, respectively, in healthy subjects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Digoxin (P-glycoprotein mediated transport)- Voriconazole (200 mg every 12 hours x 12 days) had no significant effect on steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of digoxin (0.25 mg once daily for 10 days) in healthy subjects. Mycophenolic acid (UDP-glucuronyl transferase substrate)- Voriconazole (200 mg every 12 hours x 5 days) had no significant effect on the C max and AUC \u03c4 of mycophenolic acid and its major metabolite, mycophenolic acid glucuronide after administration of a 1 gram single oral dose of mycophenolate mofetil. Two-Way Interactions Concomitant use of the following agents with voriconazole is contraindicated: Rifabutin (potent CYP450 inducer)- Rifabutin (300 mg once daily) decreased the C max and AUC \u03c4 of voriconazole at 200 mg twice daily by an average of 67% (90% CI: 58%, 73%) and 79% (90% CI: 71%, 84%), respectively, in healthy subjects. During coadministration with rifabutin (300 mg once daily), the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of voriconazole following an increased dose of 400 mg twice daily were on average approximately 2 times higher, compared with voriconazole alone at 200 mg twice daily. Coadministration of voriconazole at 400 mg twice daily with rifabutin 300 mg twice daily increased the C max and AUC \u03c4 of rifabutin by an average of 3-times (90% CI: 2.2, 4.0) and 4 times (90% CI: 3.5, 5.4), respectively, compared to rifabutin given alone [see Contraindications (4) ] . Significant drug interactions that may require dosage adjustment, frequent monitoring of drug levels and/or frequent monitoring of drug-related adverse reactions/toxicity: Efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate) -Standard doses of voriconazole and efavirenz (400 mg every 24 hours or higher) must not be coadministered [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Steady state efavirenz (400 mg PO every 24 hours) decreased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of voriconazole (400 mg PO every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg PO every 12 hours for 8 days) by an average of 61% and 77%, respectively, in healthy male subjects. Voriconazole at steady state (400 mg PO every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 8 days) increased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of efavirenz (400 mg PO every 24 hours for 9 days) by an average of 38% and 44%, respectively, in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of adjusted doses of voriconazole and efavirenz were studied in healthy male subjects following administration of voriconazole (400 mg PO every 12 hours on Days 2 to 7) with efavirenz (300 mg PO every 24 hours on Days 1 to 7), relative to steady-state administration of voriconazole (400 mg for 1 day, then 200 mg PO every 12 hours for 2 days) or efavirenz (600 mg every 24 hours for 9 days). Coadministration of voriconazole 400 mg every 12 hours with efavirenz 300 mg every 24 hours, decreased voriconazole AUC \u03c4 by 7% (90% CI: -23%, 13%) and increased C max by 23% (90% CI: -1%, 53%); efavirenz AUC \u03c4 was increased by 17% (90% CI: 6%, 29%) and C max was equivalent [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Contraindications (4) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Phenytoin (CYP2C9 substrate and potent CYP450 inducer) -Repeat dose administration of phenytoin (300 mg once daily) decreased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of orally administered voriconazole (200 mg every 12 hours x 14 days) by an average of 50% and 70%, respectively, in healthy subjects. Administration of a higher voriconazole dose (400 mg every 12 hours x 7 days) with phenytoin (300 mg once daily) resulted in comparable steady state voriconazole C max and AUC \u03c4 estimates as compared to when voriconazole was given at 200 mg every 12 hours without phenytoin [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Repeat dose administration of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours x 10 days) increased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of phenytoin (300 mg once daily) by an average of 70% and 80%, respectively, in healthy subjects. The increase in phenytoin C max and AUC when coadministered with voriconazole may be expected to be as high as 2 times the C max and AUC estimates when phenytoin is given without voriconazole [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Omeprazole (CYP2C19 inhibitor; CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 substrate) -Coadministration of omeprazole (40 mg once daily x 10 days) with oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours x 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours x 9 days) increased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of voriconazole by an average of 15% (90% CI: 5%, 25%) and 40% (90% CI: 29%, 55%), respectively, in healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment of voriconazole is recommended. Coadministration of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours x 1 day, then 200 mg x 6 days) with omeprazole (40 mg once daily x 7 days) to healthy subjects significantly increased the steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of omeprazole an average of 2 times (90% CI: 1.8, 2.6) and 4 times (90% CI: 3.3, 4.4), respectively, as compared to when omeprazole is given without voriconazole [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Oral Contraceptives (CYP3A4 substrate; CYP2C19 inhibitor) -Coadministration of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 3 days) and oral contraceptive (Ortho-Novum1/35 \u00ae consisting of 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 1 mg norethindrone, every 24 hours) to healthy female subjects at steady state increased the C max and AUC \u03c4 of ethinyl estradiol by an average of 36% (90% CI: 28%, 45%) and 61% (90% CI: 50%, 72%), respectively, and that of norethindrone by 15% (90% CI: 3%, 28%) and 53% (90% CI: 44%, 63%), respectively in healthy subjects. Voriconazole C max and AUC \u03c4 increased by an average of 14% (90% CI: 3%, 27%) and 46% (90% CI: 32%, 61%), respectively [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was seen and no dosage adjustment of these drugs is recommended: Indinavir (CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate) -Repeat dose administration of indinavir (800 mg TID for 10 days) had no significant effect on voriconazole C max and AUC following repeat dose administration (200 mg every 12 hours for 17 days) in healthy subjects. Repeat dose administration of voriconazole (200 mg every 12 hours for 7 days) did not have a significant effect on steady state C max and AUC \u03c4 of indinavir following repeat dose administration (800 mg TID for 7 days) in healthy subjects. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Voriconazole is an azole antifungal drug. The primary mode of action of voriconazole is the inhibition of fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylation, an essential step in fungal ergosterol biosynthesis. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of voriconazole. Resistance A potential for development of resistance to voriconazole is well known. The mechanisms of resistance may include mutations in the gene ERG11 (encodes for the target enzyme, lanosterol 14-\u03b1-demethylase), upregulation of genes encoding the ATP-binding cassette efflux transporters i.e., Candida drug resistance (CDR) pumps and reduced access of the drug to the target, or some combination of those mechanisms. The frequency of drug resistance development for the various fungi for which this drug is indicated is not known. Fungal isolates exhibiting reduced susceptibility to fluconazole or itraconazole may also show reduced susceptibility to voriconazole, suggesting cross-resistance can occur among these azoles. The relevance of cross-resistance and clinical outcome has not been fully characterized. Clinical cases where azole cross-resistance is demonstrated may require alternative antifungal therapy. Antimicrobial Activity Voriconazole has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections. Aspergillus fumigatus Aspergillus flavus Aspergillus niger Aspergillus terreus Candida albicans Candida glabrata (In clinical studies, the voriconazole MIC 90 was 4 mcg/mL) * Candida krusei Candida parapsilosis Candida tropicalis Fusarium spp. including Fusarium solani Scedosporium apiospermum * In clinical studies, voriconazole MIC 90 for C. glabrata baseline isolates was 4 mcg/mL; 13/50 (26%) C. glabrata baseline isolates were resistant (MIC \u22654 mcg/mL) to voriconazole. However, based on 1,054 isolates tested in surveillance studies the MIC 90 was 1 mcg/mL. The following data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following fungi exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for voriconazole against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the effectiveness of voriconazole in treating clinical infections due to these fungi has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials: Candida lusitaniae Candida guilliermondii Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C19, significantly involved in the metabolism of voriconazole, exhibits genetic polymorphism. Approximately 15 to 20% of Asian populations may be expected to be poor metabolizers. For Caucasians and Blacks, the prevalence of poor metabolizers is 3 to 5%. Studies conducted in Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects have shown that poor metabolizers have, on average, 4-fold higher voriconazole exposure (AUC \u03c4 ) than their homozygous extensive metabolizer counterparts. Subjects who are heterozygous extensive metabolizers have, on average, 2-fold higher voriconazole exposure than their homozygous extensive metabolizer counterparts [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Eugia US LLC"], "substance_name": ["VORICONAZOLE"], "effective_time": "20240305", "product_ndc": ["55150-321"], "brand_name": ["Voriconazole"]}

Legionnaires' Disease caused by Legionella pneumophila . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, in vitro and limited preliminary clinical data suggest that erythromycin may be effective in treating Legionnaires' Disease. Prevention of Initial Attacks of Rheumatic Fever Penicillin is considered by the American Heart Association to be the drug of choice in the prevention of initial attacks of rheumatic fever (treatment of Group A betahemolytic streptococcal infections of the upper respiratory tract e.g., tonsillitis, or pharyngitis). 1 Erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of penicillin-allergic patients. The therapeutic dose should be administered for ten days. Prevention of Recurrent Attacks of Rheumatic Fever Penicillin or sulfonamides are considered by the American Heart Association to be the drugs of choice in the prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever. In patients who are allergic to penicillin and sulfonamides, oral erythromycin is recommended by the American Heart Association in the long-term prophylaxis of streptococcal pharyngitis (for the prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever). 1 Prevention of Bacterial Endocarditis Although no controlled clinical efficacy trials have been conducted, oral erythromycin has been recommended by the American Heart Association for prevention of bacterial endocarditis in penicillin-allergic patients with prosthetic cardiac valves, most congenital cardiac malformations, surgically constructed systemic pulmonary shunts, rheumatic or other acquired valvular dysfunction, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS), previous history of bacterial endocarditis and mitral valve prolapse with insufficiency when they undergo dental procedures and surgical procedures of the upper respiratory tract. 2 To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of erythromycin and other antibacterial drugs, erythromycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

Hydralazine apparently lowers blood pressure by exerting a peripheral vasodilating effect through a direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Hydralazine, by altering cellular calcium metabolism, interferes with the calcium movements within the vascular smooth muscle that are responsible for initiating or maintaining the contractile state. The peripheral vasodilating effect of hydralazine results in decreased arterial blood pressure (diastolic more than systolic); decreased peripheral vascular resistance; and an increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. The preferential dilatation of arterioles, as compared to veins, minimizes postural hypotension and promotes the increase in cardiac output. Hydralazine usually increases renin activity in plasma, presumably as a result of increased secretion of renin by the renal juxtaglomerular cells in response to reflex sympathetic discharge. This increase in renin activity leads to the production of angiotensin II, which then causes stimulation of aldosterone and consequent sodium reabsorption. Hydralazine also maintains or increases renal and cerebral blood flow.

Although the antiresorptive mechanism is not completely understood, several factors are thought to contribute to this action. In vitro , zoledronic acid inhibits osteoclastic activity and induces osteoclast apoptosis. Zoledronic acid also blocks the osteoclastic resorption of mineralized bone and cartilage through its binding to bone. Zoledronic acid inhibits the increased osteoclastic activity and skeletal calcium release induced by various stimulatory factors released by tumors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical studies in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) showed that single-dose infusions of zoledronic acid injection are associated with decreases in serum calcium and phosphorus and increases in urinary calcium and phosphorus excretion. Osteoclastic hyperactivity resulting in excessive bone resorption is the underlying pathophysiologic derangement in hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM, tumor-induced hypercalcemia) and metastatic bone disease. Excessive release of calcium into the blood as bone is resorbed results in polyuria and gastrointestinal disturbances, with progressive dehydration and decreasing glomerular filtration rate. This, in turn, results in increased renal resorption of calcium, setting up a cycle of worsening systemic hypercalcemia. Reducing excessive bone resorption and maintaining adequate fluid administration are, therefore, essential to the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy. Patients who have hypercalcemia of malignancy can generally be divided into two groups according to the pathophysiologic mechanism involved: humoral hypercalcemia and hypercalcemia due to tumor invasion of bone. In humoral hypercalcemia, osteoclasts are activated and bone resorption is stimulated by factors such as parathyroid hormone-related protein, which are elaborated by the tumor and circulate systemically. Humoral hypercalcemia usually occurs in squamous cell malignancies of the lung or head and neck or in genitourinary tumors such as renal cell carcinoma or ovarian cancer. Skeletal metastases may be absent or minimal in these patients. Extensive invasion of bone by tumor cells can also result in hypercalcemia due to local tumor products that stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. Tumors commonly associated with locally mediated hypercalcemia include breast cancer and multiple myeloma. Total serum calcium levels in patients who have hypercalcemia of malignancy may not reflect the severity of hypercalcemia, since concomitant hypoalbuminemia is commonly present. Ideally, ionized calcium levels should be used to diagnose and follow hypercalcemic conditions; however, these are not commonly or rapidly available in many clinical situations. Therefore, adjustment of the total serum calcium value for differences in albumin levels (corrected serum calcium, CSC) is often used in place of measurement of ionized calcium; several nomograms are in use for this type of calculation [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic data in patients with hypercalcemia are not available. Distribution Single or multiple (every 28 days) 5-minute or 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8, or 16 mg zoledronic acid injection were given to 64 patients with cancer and bone metastases. The postinfusion decline of zoledronic acid concentrations in plasma was consistent with a triphasic process showing a rapid decrease from peak concentrations at end of infusion to less than 1% of C max 24 hours postinfusion with population half-lives of t 1/2\u03b1 0.24 hours and t 1/2\u03b2 1.87 hours for the early disposition phases of the drug. The terminal elimination phase of zoledronic acid was prolonged, with very low concentrations in plasma between Days 2 and 28 postinfusion, and a terminal elimination half-life t 1/2\u03b3 of 146 hours. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC 0-24h ) of zoledronic acid was dose proportional from 2 to 16 mg. The accumulation of zoledronic acid measured over three cycles was low, with mean AUC 0-24h ratios for cycles 2 and 3 versus 1 of 1.13 \u00b1 0.30 and 1.16 \u00b1 0.36, respectively. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed low affinity of zoledronic acid for the cellular components of human blood, with a mean blood to plasma concentration ratio of 0.59 in a concentration range of 30 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. In vitro, the plasma protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% at 2 ng/mL to 77% at 2000 ng/mL of zoledronic acid. Metabolism Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro . Zoledronic acid does not undergo biotransformation in vivo . In animal studies, less than 3% of the administered intravenous dose was found in the feces, with the balance either recovered in the urine or taken up by bone, indicating that the drug is eliminated intact via the kidney. Following an intravenous dose of 20 nCi 14 C-zoledronic acid in a patient with cancer and bone metastases, only a single radioactive species with chromatographic properties identical to those of parent drug was recovered in urine, which suggests that zoledronic acid is not metabolized. Excretion In 64 patients with cancer and bone metastases, on average (\u00b1 SD) 39 \u00b1 16% of the administered zoledronic acid dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours, with only trace amounts of drug found in urine post-Day 2. The cumulative percent of drug excreted in the urine over 0 to 24 hours was independent of dose. The balance of drug not recovered in urine over 0 to 24 hours, representing drug presumably bound to bone, is slowly released back into the systemic circulation, giving rise to the observed prolonged low plasma concentrations. The 0 to 24 hour renal clearance of zoledronic acid was 3.7 \u00b1 2.0 L/h. Zoledronic acid clearance was independent of dose but dependent upon the patient\u2019s creatinine clearance. In a study in patients with cancer and bone metastases, increasing the infusion time of a 4 mg dose of zoledronic acid from 5 minutes (n=5) to 15 minutes (n=7) resulted in a 34% decrease in the zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion ([mean \u00b1 SD] 403 \u00b1 118 ng/mL versus 264 \u00b1 86 ng/mL) and a 10% increase in the total AUC (378 \u00b1 116 ng x h/mL versus 420 \u00b1 218 ng x h/mL). The difference between the AUC means was not statistically significant. Special Populations Pediatrics Zoledronic acid injection is not indicated for use in children. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] Geriatrics The pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid were not affected by age in patients with cancer and bone metastases who ranged in age from 38 years to 84 years. Race Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not indicate any differences in pharmacokinetics among Japanese and North American (Caucasian and African American) patients with cancer and bone metastases. Hepatic Insufficiency No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. Renal Insufficiency The pharmacokinetic studies conducted in 64 cancer patients represented typical clinical populations with normal to moderately impaired renal function.

The mean bioavailability is approximately 90%. Following 1 g daily I.M. administration, mean peak plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in approximately 2.3 hours (T max ). Distribution Ertapenem is highly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily albumin. In healthy young adults, the protein binding of ertapenem decreases as plasma concentrations increase, from approximately 95% bound at an approximate plasma concentration of <100 micrograms (mcg)/mL to approximately 85% bound at an approximate plasma concentration of 300 mcg/mL. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state (V ss ) of ertapenem in adults is approximately 0.12 liter/kg, approximately 0.2 liter/kg in pediatric patients 3 months to 12 years of age and approximately 0.16 liter/kg in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age. The concentrations of ertapenem achieved in suction-induced skin blister fluid at each sampling point on the third day of 1 g once daily I.V. doses are presented in Table 10 . The ratio of AUC 0-24 in skin blister fluid/AUC 0-24 in plasma is 0.61. Table 10: Concentrations (mcg/mL) of Ertapenem in Adult Skin Blister Fluid at each Sampling Point on the Third Day of 1-g Once Daily I.V. Doses 0.5 hr 1 hr 2 hr 4 hr 8 hr 12 hr 24 hr 7 12 17 24 24 21 8 Metabolism In healthy young adults, after infusion of 1 g I.V. radiolabeled ertapenem, the plasma radioactivity consists predominantly (94%) of ertapenem. The major metabolite of ertapenem is the inactive ring-opened derivative formed by hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring. Elimination Ertapenem is eliminated primarily by the kidneys. The mean plasma half-life in healthy young adults is approximately 4 hours and the plasma clearance is approximately 1.8 L/hour. The mean plasma half-life in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age is approximately 4 hours and approximately 2.5 hours in pediatric patients 3 months to 12 years of age. Following the administration of 1 g I.V. radiolabeled ertapenem to healthy young adults, approximately 80% is recovered in urine and 10% in feces. Of the 80% recovered in urine, approximately 38% is excreted as unchanged drug and approximately 37% as the ring-opened metabolite. In healthy young adults given a 1 g I.V. dose, the mean percentage of the administered dose excreted in urine was 17.4% during 0 to 2 hours postdose, 5.4% during 4 to 6 hours postdose, and 2.4% during 12 to 24 hours postdose. Special Populations Renal Impairment Total and unbound fractions of ertapenem pharmacokinetics were investigated in 26 adult subjects (31 to 80 years of age) with varying degrees of renal impairment. Following a single 1 g I.V. dose of ertapenem, the unbound AUC increased 1.5-fold and 2.3-fold in subjects with mild renal impairment (CL CR 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and moderate renal impairment (CL CR 31 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), respectively, compared with healthy young subjects (25 to 45 years of age). No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with CL CR \u226531 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . The unbound AUC increased 4.4-fold and 7.6-fold in subjects with advanced renal impairment (CL CR 5 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and end-stage renal disease (CL CR <10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), respectively, compared with healthy young subjects. The effects of renal impairment on AUC of total drug were of smaller magnitude. The recommended dose of ertapenem in adult patients with CL CR \u226430 mL/min/1.73 m 2 is 0.5 grams every 24 hours. Following a single 1 g I.V. dose given immediately prior to a 4 hour hemodialysis session in 5 adult patients with end-stage renal disease, approximately 30% of the dose was recovered in the dialysate. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . There are no data in pediatric patients with renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of ertapenem in patients with hepatic impairment have not been established. However, ertapenem does not appear to undergo hepatic metabolism based on in vitro studies and approximately 10% of an administered dose is recovered in the feces [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Gender The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of ertapenem was evaluated in healthy male (n=8) and healthy female (n=8) subjects. The differences observed could be attributed to body size when body weight was taken into consideration. No dose adjustment is recommended based on gender. Geriatric Patients The impact of age on the pharmacokinetics of ertapenem was evaluated in healthy male (n=7) and healthy female (n=7) subjects \u226565 years of age. The total and unbound AUC increased 37% and 67%, respectively, in elderly adults relative to young adults. These changes were attributed to age-related changes in creatinine clearance. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients with normal (for their age) renal function. Pediatric Patients Plasma concentrations of ertapenem are comparable in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age and adults following a 1 g once daily I.V. dose. Following the 20 mg/kg dose (up to a maximum dose of 1 g), the pharmacokinetic parameter values in patients 13 to 17 years of age (N=6) were generally comparable to those in healthy young adults. Plasma concentrations at the midpoint of the dosing interval following a single 15 mg/kg I.V. dose of ertapenem in patients 3 months to 12 years of age are comparable to plasma concentrations at the midpoint of the dosing interval following a 1 g once daily I.V. dose in adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The plasma clearance (mL/min/kg) of ertapenem in patients 3 months to 12 years of age is approximately 2-fold higher as compared to that in adults. At the 15 mg/kg dose, the AUC value (doubled to model a twice daily dosing regimen, i.e., 30 mg/kg/day exposure) in patients 3 months to 12 years of age was comparable to the AUC value in young healthy adults receiving a 1 g I.V. dose of ertapenem. Drug Interactions When ertapenem is co-administered with probenecid (500 mg p.o. every 6 hours), probenecid competes for active tubular secretion and reduces the renal clearance of ertapenem. Based on total ertapenem concentrations, probenecid increased the AUC of ertapenem by 25%, and reduced the plasma and renal clearance of ertapenem by 20% and 35%, respectively. The half-life of ertapenem was increased from 4 to 4.8 hours. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that ertapenem does not inhibit metabolism mediated by any of the following cytochrome p450 (CYP) isoforms: 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. In vitro studies indicate that ertapenem does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of digoxin or vinblastine and that ertapenem is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Ertapenem has in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of ertapenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through ertapenem binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). In Escherichia coli , it has strong affinity toward PBPs 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4 and 5 with preference for PBPs 2 and 3. Resistance Ertapenem is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases. Ertapenem is hydrolyzed by metallo-beta-lactamases. Antimicrobial Activity Ertapenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase negative isolates only) Klebsiella pneumoniae Moraxella catarrhalis Proteus mirabilis Anaerobic bacteria: Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides distasonis Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Bacteroides uniformis Clostridium clostridioforme Eubacterium lentum Peptostreptococcus species Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown . At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for ertapenem. However, the efficacy of ertapenem in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials: Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-intermediate isolates) Gram-negative bacteria: Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter aerogenes Enterobacter cloacae Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive isolates only) Haemophilus parainfluenzae Klebsiella oxytoca (excluding ESBL producing isolates) Morganella morganii Proteus vulgaris Providencia rettgeri Providencia stuartii Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria: Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium perfringens Fusobacterium spp. Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC ."], "manufacturer_name": ["Hospira, Inc."], "substance_name": ["ERTAPENEM SODIUM"], "effective_time": "20241106", "product_ndc": ["0409-3510"], "brand_name": ["Ertapenem"]}

Piperacillin, tazobactam and desethyl piperacillin are also secreted into the bile. Specific Populations Renal Impairment After the administration of single doses of piperacillin and tazobactam to subjects with renal impairment, the half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. At creatinine clearance below 20 mL/min, the increase in half-life is twofold for piperacillin and fourfold for tazobactam compared to subjects with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments for piperacillin and tazobactam for injection are recommended when creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min in patients receiving the usual recommended daily dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection. See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) for specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with renal impairment. Hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of a piperacillin and tazobactam dose with an additional 5% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. Peritoneal dialysis removes approximately 6% and 21% of the piperacillin and tazobactam doses, respectively, with up to 16% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. For dosage recommendations for patients undergoing hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Hepatic Impairment The half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases by approximately 25% and 18%, respectively, in patients with hepatic cirrhosis compared to healthy subjects. However, this difference does not warrant dosage adjustment of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection due to hepatic cirrhosis. Pediatrics Piperacillin and tazobactam pharmacokinetics were studied in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older. The clearance of both compounds is slower in the younger patients compared to older children and adults. In a population PK analysis, estimated clearance for 9 month-old to 12 year-old patients was comparable to adults, with a population mean (SE) value of 5.64 (0.34) mL/min/kg. The piperacillin clearance estimate is 80% of this value for pediatric patients 2 to 9 months old. In patients younger than 2 months of age, clearance of piperacillin is slower compared to older children; however, it is not adequately characterized for dosing recommendations. The population mean (SE) for piperacillin volume of distribution is 0.243 (0.011) L/kg and is independent of age. Geriatrics The impact of age on the pharmacokinetics of piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male subjects, aged 18 to 35 years (n=6) and aged 65 to 80 years (n=12). Mean half-life for piperacillin and tazobactam was 32% and 55% higher, respectively, in the elderly compared to the younger subjects. This difference may be due to age-related changes in creatinine clearance. Race The effect of race on piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male volunteers. No difference in piperacillin or tazobactam pharmacokinetics was observed between Asian (n=9) and Caucasian (n=9) healthy volunteers who received single 4/0.5 g doses. Drug Interactions The potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between piperacillin and tazobactam for injection and aminoglycosides, probenecid, vancomycin, heparin, vecuronium, and methotrexate has been evaluated [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Piperacillin sodium exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting septum formation and cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. In vitro , piperacillin is active against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Tazobactam sodium has little clinically relevant in vitro activity against bacteria due to its reduced affinity to penicillin-binding proteins. It is, however, a beta-lactamase inhibitor of the Molecular class A enzymes, including Richmond-Sykes class III (Bush class 2b & 2b') penicillinases and cephalosporinases. It varies in its ability to inhibit class II and IV (2a & 4) penicillinases. Tazobactam does not induce chromosomally-mediated \u03b2-lactamases at tazobactam concentrations achieved with the recommended dosage regimen. Antimicrobial Activity Piperacillin and tazobactam has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . Aerobic bacteria Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae (excluding beta-lactamase negative, ampicillin-resistant isolates) Klebsiella pneumoniae Pseudomonas aeruginosa (given in combination with an aminoglycoside to which the isolate is susceptible) Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis group ( B. fragilis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, and B. vulgatus ) The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for piperacillin and tazobactam against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of piperacillin and tazobactam in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Aerobic bacteria Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (ampicillin or penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae \u2020 Streptococcus pneumoniae \u2020 (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes \u2020 Viridans group streptococci \u2020 Gram-negative bacteria Citrobacter koseri Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Neisseria gonorrhoeae Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Providencia stuartii Providencia rettgeri Salmonella enterica Anaerobic bacteria Clostridium perfringens Bacteroides distasonis Prevotella melaninogenica \u2020 These are not beta-lactamase producing bacteria and, therefore, are susceptible to piperacillin alone.

{"indications_and_usage": ["1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Levofloxacin Injection is indicated for the treatment of adults (\u226518 years of age) with mild, moderate, and severe infections caused by susceptible isolates of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed in this section. Levofloxacin Injection is indicated when intravenous administration offers a route of administration advantageous to the patient (e.g., patient cannot tolerate an oral dosage form). Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial indicated in adults (\u226518 years of age) with infections caused by designated, susceptible bacteria ( 1 , 12.4 ). \u2022 Pneumonia: Nosocomial ( 1.1 ) and Community Acquired ( 1.2 , 1.3 ) \u2022 Skin and Skin Structure Infections: Complicated ( 1.4 ) and Uncomplicated ( 1.5 ) \u2022 Chronic bacterial prostatitis ( 1.6 ) \u2022 Inhalational Anthrax, Post-Exposure ( 1.7 ) \u2022 Plague ( 1.8 ) \u2022 Urinary Tract Infections: Complicated ( 1.9 , 1.10 ) and Uncomplicated ( 1.12 ) \u2022 Acute Pyelonephritis ( 1.11 ) \u2022 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis ( 1.13 ) \u2022 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis ( 1.14 ) Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Levofloxacin and other antibacterial drugs, Levofloxacin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria ( 1.15 ). 1.1 Nosocomial Pneumonia Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Serratia marcescens , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , or Streptococcus pneumoniae . Adjunctive therapy should be used as clinically indicated. Where Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a documented or presumptive pathogen, combination therapy with an anti-pseudomonal \u03b2-lactam is recommended [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Community-Acquired Pneumonia: 7\u201314 day Treatment Regimen Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multi-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [MDRSP]), Haemophilus influenzae , Haemophilus parainfluenzae , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Moraxella catarrhalis , Chlamydophila pneumoniae , Legionella pneumophila , or Mycoplasma pneumoniae [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. MDRSP isolates are isolates resistant to two or more of the following antibacterials: penicillin (MIC \u22652mcg/mL), 2 nd generation cephalosporins, e.g., cefuroxime, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. 1.3 Community-Acquired Pneumonia: 5-day Treatment Regimen Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (excluding multi-drug-resistant isolates [MDRSP]), Haemophilus influenzae , Haemophilus parainfluenzae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , or Chlamydophila pneumoniae [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. 1.4 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus , Enterococcus faecalis , Streptococcus pyogenes , or Proteus mirabilis [ see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. 1.5 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (mild to moderate) including abscesses, cellulitis, furuncles, impetigo, pyoderma, wound infections, due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus , or Streptococcus pyogenes . 1.6 Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis due to Escherichia coli , Enterococcus faecalis , or methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis [ see Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. 1.7 Inhalational Anthrax (Post-Exposure) Levofloxacin is indicated for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis . The effectiveness of levofloxacin is based on plasma concentrations achieved in humans, a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Levofloxacin has not been tested in humans for the post-exposure prevention of inhalation anthrax. The safety of levofloxacin in adults for durations of therapy beyond 28 days or in pediatric patients for durations of therapy beyond 14 days has not been studied. Prolonged levofloxacin therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.9) ] . 1.8 Plague Levofloxacin is indicated for treatment of plague, including pneumonic and septicemic plague, due to Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) and prophylaxis for plague in adults and pediatric patients, 6 months of age and older. Efficacy studies of levofloxacin could not be conducted in humans with plague for ethical and feasibility reasons. Therefore, approval of this indication was based on an efficacy study conducted in animals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.10)] . 1.9 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: 5-day Treatment Regimen Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , or Proteus mirabilis [ see Clinical Studies (14.7) ]. 1.10 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: 10-day Treatment Regimen Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (mild to moderate) due to Enterococcus faecalis , Enterobacter cloacae , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Proteus mirabilis , or Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ see Clinical Studies (14.8) ]. 1.11 Acute Pyelonephritis: 5 or 10-day Treatment Regimen Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis caused by Escherichia coli , including cases with concurrent bacteremia [ see Clinical Studies (14.7 , 14.8) ]. 1.12 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (mild to moderate) due to Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , or Staphylococcus saprophyticus . Because fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1\u20135.15)] and for some patients uncomplicated urinary tract infection is self-limiting, reserve levofloxacin for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in patients who have no alternative treatment options. 1.13 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ABECB) due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Haemophilus parainfluenzae , or Moraxella catarrhalis . Because fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1\u20135.15)] and for some patients ABECB is self-limiting, reserve levofloxacin for treatment of ABECB in patients who have no alternative treatment options. 1.14 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis: 5-day and 10\u201314 day Treatment Regimens Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) due to Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Because fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1\u20135.15)] and for some patients ABS is self-limiting, reserve levofloxacin for treatment of ABS in patients who have no alternative treatment options. 1.15 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of levofloxacin and other antibacterial drugs, levofloxacin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Culture and susceptibility testing Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing the infection and to determine their susceptibility to levofloxacin [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . Therapy with levofloxacin may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available, appropriate therapy should be selected. As with other drugs in this class, some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with levofloxacin. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information about the continued susceptibility of the pathogens to the antimicrobial agent and also the possible emergence of bacterial resistance."], "generic_name": ["LEVOFLOXACIN"], "id": "0fdd98a4-f30a-43ec-87cd-311aacdce7c8", "route": ["INTRAVENOUS"], "description": ["11 DESCRIPTION Levofloxacin is a synthetic broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for intravenous administration. Chemically, levofloxacin, a chiral fluorinated carboxyquinolone, is the pure (-)-(S)-enantiomer of the racemic drug substance ofloxacin. The chemical name is (-)-(S)-9-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-7H-pyrido[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid hemihydrate. Figure 1: The Chemical Structure of Levofloxacin The empirical formula is C 18 H 20 FN 3 O 4 \u2219 \u00bd H 2 O and the molecular weight is 370.38. Levofloxacin is a light yellowish-white to yellow-white crystal or crystalline powder. The molecule exists as a zwitterion at the pH conditions in the small intestine. The data demonstrate that from pH 0.6 to 5.8, the solubility of levofloxacin is essentially constant (approximately 100 mg/mL). Levofloxacin is considered soluble to freely soluble in this pH range, as defined by USP nomenclature. Above pH 5.8, the solubility increases rapidly to its maximum at pH 6.7 (272 mg/mL) and is considered freely soluble in this range. Above pH 6.7, the solubility decreases and reaches a minimum value (about 50 mg/mL) at a pH of approximately 6.9. Levofloxacin has the potential to form stable coordination compounds with many metal ions. This in vitro chelation potential has the following formation order: Al +3 >Cu +2 >Zn +2 >Mg +2 >Ca +2 . Excipients and Description of Dosage Forms Levofloxacin Injection The appearance of Levofloxacin Injection may range from a clear yellow to a clear greenish-yellow solution. This does not adversely affect product potency. Levofloxacin Injection Premix in Single-Use Flexible Containers is a sterile, preservative-free aqueous solution of levofloxacin with pH ranging from 3.8 to 5.8. This is a dilute, non-pyrogenic, nearly isotonic premixed solution that contains levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose (D 5 W). Solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust the pH. The flexible plastic container is latex-free and fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride. The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container's chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers.

Peak plasma concentrations are usually attained one to two hours after oral dosing. The absolute bioavailability of levofloxacin from a 500 mg tablet and a 750 mg tablet of levofloxacin are both approximately 99%, demonstrating complete oral absorption of levofloxacin. Following a single intravenous dose of levofloxacin to healthy volunteers, the mean \u00b1 SD peak plasma concentration attained was 6.2 \u00b1 1.0 mcg/mL after a 500 mg dose infused over 60 minutes and 11.5 \u00b1 4.0 mcg/mL after a 750 mg dose infused over 90 minutes. Levofloxacin Oral Solution and Tablet formulations are bioequivalent. Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics are linear and predictable after single and multiple oral or IV dosing regimens. Steady-state conditions are reached within 48 hours following a 500 mg or 750 mg once-daily dosage regimen. The mean \u00b1 SD peak and trough plasma concentrations attained following multiple once-daily oral dosage regimens were approximately 5.7 \u00b1 1.4 and 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 mcg/mL after the 500 mg doses, and 8.6 \u00b1 1.9 and 1.1 \u00b1 0.4 mcg/mL after the 750 mg doses, respectively. The mean \u00b1 SD peak and trough plasma concentrations attained following multiple once-daily IV regimens were approximately 6.4 \u00b1 0.8 and 0.6 \u00b1 0.2 mcg/mL after the 500 mg doses, and 12.1 \u00b1 4.1 and 1.3 \u00b1 0.71 mcg/mL after the 750 mg doses, respectively. Oral administration of a 500 mg dose of levofloxacin with food prolongs the time to peak concentration by approximately 1 hour and decreases the peak concentration by approximately 14% following tablet and approximately 25% following oral solution administration. Therefore, levofloxacin tablets can be administered without regard to food. It is recommended that levofloxacin oral solution be taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. The plasma concentration profile of levofloxacin after IV administration is similar and comparable in extent of exposure (AUC) to that observed for levofloxacin tablets when equal doses (mg/mg) are administered. Therefore, the oral and IV routes of administration can be considered interchangeable ( see Figure 2 and Figure 3 ) . Figure 2: Mean Levofloxacin Plasma Concentration vs. Time Profile: 750 mg Figure 3: Mean Levofloxacin Plasma Concentration vs. Time Profile: 500 mg Figure 2 Figure 3 Distribution The mean volume of distribution of levofloxacin generally ranges from 74 to 112 L after single and multiple 500 mg or 750 mg doses, indicating widespread distribution into body tissues. Levofloxacin reaches its peak levels in skin tissues and in blister fluid of healthy subjects at approximately 3 hours after dosing. The skin tissue biopsy to plasma AUC ratio is approximately 2 and the blister fluid to plasma AUC ratio is approximately 1 following multiple once-daily oral administration of 750 mg and 500 mg doses of levofloxacin, respectively, to healthy subjects. Levofloxacin also penetrates well into lung tissues. Lung tissue concentrations were generally 2- to 5-fold higher than plasma concentrations and ranged from approximately 2.4 to 11.3 mcg/g over a 24-hour period after a single 500 mg oral dose. In vitro , over a clinically relevant range (1 to 10 mcg/mL) of serum/plasma levofloxacin concentrations, levofloxacin is approximately 24 to 38% bound to serum proteins across all species studied, as determined by the equilibrium dialysis method. Levofloxacin is mainly bound to serum albumin in humans. Levofloxacin binding to serum proteins is independent of the drug concentration. Metabolism Levofloxacin is stereochemically stable in plasma and urine and does not invert metabolically to its enantiomer, D-ofloxacin. Levofloxacin undergoes limited metabolism in humans and is primarily excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. Following oral administration, approximately 87% of an administered dose was recovered as unchanged drug in urine within 48 hours, whereas less than 4% of the dose was recovered in feces in 72 hours. Less than 5% of an administered dose was recovered in the urine as the desmethyl and N-oxide metabolites, the only metabolites identified in humans. These metabolites have little relevant pharmacological activity. Excretion Levofloxacin is excreted largely as unchanged drug in the urine. The mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin ranges from approximately 6 to 8 hours following single or multiple doses of levofloxacin given orally or intravenously. The mean apparent total body clearance and renal clearance range from approximately 144 to 226 mL/min and 96 to 142 mL/min, respectively. Renal clearance in excess of the glomerular filtration rate suggests that tubular secretion of levofloxacin occurs in addition to its glomerular filtration. Concomitant administration of either cimetidine or probenecid results in approximately 24% and 35% reduction in the levofloxacin renal clearance, respectively, indicating that secretion of levofloxacin occurs in the renal proximal tubule. No levofloxacin crystals were found in any of the urine samples freshly collected from subjects receiving levofloxacin. Geriatric There are no significant differences in levofloxacin pharmacokinetics between young and elderly subjects when the subjects' differences in creatinine clearance are taken into consideration. Following a 500 mg oral dose of levofloxacin to healthy elderly subjects (66 \u2013 80 years of age), the mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin was about 7.6 hours, as compared to approximately 6 hours in younger adults. The difference was attributable to the variation in renal function status of the subjects and was not believed to be clinically significant. Drug absorption appears to be unaffected by age. Levofloxacin dose adjustment based on age alone is not necessary [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Pediatrics The pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin following a single 7 mg/kg intravenous dose were investigated in pediatric patients ranging in age from 6 months to 16 years. Pediatric patients cleared levofloxacin faster than adult patients, resulting in lower plasma exposures than adults for a given mg/kg dose. Subsequent pharmacokinetic analyses predicted that a dosage regimen of 8 mg/kg every 12 hours (not to exceed 250 mg per dose) for pediatric patients 6 months to 17 years of age would achieve comparable steady state plasma exposures (AUC 0\u201324 and C max ) to those observed in adult patients administered 500 mg of levofloxacin once every 24 hours. Gender There are no significant differences in levofloxacin pharmacokinetics between male and female subjects when subjects' differences in creatinine clearance are taken into consideration. Following a 500 mg oral dose of levofloxacin to healthy male subjects, the mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin was about 7.5 hours, as compared to approximately 6.1 hours in female subjects. This difference was attributable to the variation in renal function status of the male and female subjects and was not believed to be clinically significant. Drug absorption appears to be unaffected by the gender of the subjects. Dose adjustment based on gender alone is not necessary. Race The effect of race on levofloxacin pharmacokinetics was examined through a covariate analysis performed on data from 72 subjects: 48 white and 24 non-white. The apparent total body clearance and apparent volume of distribution were not affected by the race of the subjects. Renal Impairment Clearance of levofloxacin is substantially reduced and plasma elimination half-life is substantially prolonged in adult patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), requiring dosage adjustment in such patients to avoid accumulation. Neither hemodialysis nor continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is effective in removal of levofloxacin from the body, indicating that supplemental doses of levofloxacin are not required following hemodialysis or CAPD [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Hepatic Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies in hepatically impaired patients have not been conducted. Due to the limited extent of levofloxacin metabolism, the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin are not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Bacterial Infection The pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin in patients with serious community-acquired bacterial infections are comparable to those observed in healthy subjects. Drug-Drug Interactions The potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between levofloxacin and antacids, warfarin, theophylline, cyclosporine, digoxin, probenecid, and cimetidine has been evaluated [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Levofloxacin is the L-isomer of the racemate, ofloxacin, a quinolone antimicrobial agent. The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin resides primarily in the L-isomer. The mechanism of action of levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolone antimicrobials involves inhibition of bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase (both of which are type II topoisomerases), enzymes required for DNA replication, transcription, repair and recombination. Resistance Fluoroquinolone resistance can arise through mutations in defined regions of DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV, termed the Quinolone-Resistance Determining Regions (QRDRs), or through altered efflux. Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, differ in chemical structure and mode of action from aminoglycosides, macrolides and \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins. Fluoroquinolones may, therefore, be active against bacteria resistant to these antimicrobials. Resistance to levofloxacin due to spontaneous mutation in vitro is a rare occurrence (range: 10 -9 to 10 -10 ). Cross-resistance has been observed between levofloxacin and some other fluoroquinolones, some microorganisms resistant to other fluoroquinolones may be susceptible to levofloxacin. Antimicrobial Activity Levofloxacin has in vitro activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Levofloxacin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in Indications and Usage (1) : Gram-Positive Bacteria Enterococcus faecalis Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates) Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates) Staphylococcus saprophyticus Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multi-drug resistant isolates [MDRSP] MDRSP (Multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae ) isolates are isolates resistant to two or more of the following antibiotics: penicillin (MIC \u22652 mcg/mL), 2nd generation cephalosporins, e.g., cefuroxime; macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. ) Streptococcus pyogenes Gram-Negative Bacteria Enterobacter cloacae Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Haemophilus parainfluenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Legionella pneumophila Moraxella catarrhalis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Serratia marcescens Other Bacteria Chlamydophila pneumoniae Mycoplasma pneumoniae The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown : Levofloxacin exhibits in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC values) of 2 mcg/mL or less against most (\u226590%) isolates of the following microorganisms; however, the safety and effectiveness of levofloxacin in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

It reduces impulse conduction velocity in the atria, His-Purkinje fibers, and ventricular muscle, but has variable effects on the atrioventricular (A-V) node, a direct slowing action and a weaker vagolytic effect which may speed A-V conduction slightly. Myocardial excitability is reduced in the atria, Purkinje fibers, papillary muscles, and ventricles by an increase in the threshold for excitation, combined with inhibition of ectopic pacemaker activity by retardation of the slow phase of diastolic depolarization, thus decreasing automaticity especially in ectopic sites. Contractility of the undamaged heart is usually not affected by therapeutic concentrations, although slight reduction of cardiac output may occur, and may be significant in the presence of myocardial damage. Therapeutic levels of PA may exert vagolytic effects and produce slight acceleration of heart rate, while high or toxic concentrations may prolong A-V conduction time or induce A-V block, or even cause abnormal automaticity and spontaneous firing by unknown mechanisms. The electrocardiogram may reflect these effects by showing slight sinus tachycardia (due to the anticholinergic action) and widened QRS complexes and, less regularly, prolonged Q-T and P-R intervals (due to longer systole and slower conduction), as well as some decrease in QRS and T wave amplitude. These direct effects of PA on electrical activity, conduction, responsiveness, excitability and automaticity are characteristic of a Group 1A antiarrhythmic agent, the prototype for which is quinidine; PA effects are very similar. However, PA has weaker vagal blocking action than does quinidine, does not induce alpha-adrenergic blockade, and is less depressing to cardiac contractility. Following intramuscular injection, procainamide is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, and plasma levels peak in 15 to 60 minutes, considerably faster than orally administered procainamide hydrochloride tablets or capsules which produce peak plasma levels in 90 to 120 minutes. Intravenous administration of Procainamide Hydrochloride Injection can produce therapeutic procainamide levels within minutes after infusion is started. About 15 to 20 percent of PA is reversibly bound to plasma proteins, and considerable amounts are more slowly and reversibly bound to tissues of the heart, liver, lung, and kidney. The apparent volume of distribution eventually reaches about 2 liters per kilogram body weight with a half-time of approximately five minutes. While PA has been shown in the dog to cross the blood-brain barrier, it did not concentrate in the brain at levels higher than in plasma. It is not known if PA crosses the placenta. Plasma esterases are far less active in hydrolysis of PA than of procaine. The half-time for elimination of PA is three to four hours in patients with normal renal function, but reduced creatinine clearance and advancing age each prolong the half-time of elimination of PA. A significant fraction of the circulating PA may be metabolized in hepatocytes to N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA), ranging from 16 to 21 percent of an administered dose in \"slow acetylators\" to 24 to 33 percent in \"fast-acetylators\". Since NAPA also has significant antiarrhythmic activity and somewhat slower renal clearance than PA, both hepatic acetylation rate capability and renal function, as well as age, have significant effects on the effective biologic half-time of therapeutic action of administered PA and the NAPA derivative. Trace amounts may be excreted in the urine as free and conjugated \u03c1-aminobenzoic acid, 30 to 60 percent as unchanged PA, and 6 to 52 percent as the NAPA derivative. Both PA and NAPA are eliminated by active tubular secretion as well as by glomerular filtration. Action of PA on the central nervous system is not prominent, but high plasma concentrations may cause tremors. While therapeutic plasma levels for PA have been reported to be 3 to 10 mcg/mL certain patients such as those with sustained ventricular tachycardia, may need higher levels for adequate control. This may justify the increased risk of toxicity (see OVERDOSAGE ).

The bioavailability after oral administration was reported to be about 60%, with no accumulation after repeated doses. During delivery with intramuscular injection, bioavailability increased to 78%. Ergot alkaloids are mostly eliminated by hepatic metabolism and excretion, and the decrease in bioavailability following oral administration is probably a result of first-pass metabolism in the liver.

As a result, pertuzumab inhibits ligand-initiated intracellular signaling through two major signal pathways, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Inhibition of these signaling pathways can result in cell growth arrest and apoptosis, respectively. In addition, pertuzumab mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). While pertuzumab alone inhibited the proliferation of human tumor cells, the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab augmented anti-tumor activity in HER2-overexpressing xenograft models. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of PERJETA have not been fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of pertuzumab with an initial dose of 840 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 420 mg every three weeks on QTc interval was evaluated in a subgroup of 20 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer in CLEOPATRA. At the recommended dose of PERJETA, a mean increase in the QTc interval >20 ms was not observed. A small increase in the mean QTc interval (i.e., less than 10 ms) cannot be excluded because of the limitations of the trial design. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Based on a population PK analysis that included 481 patients, pertuzumab demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics at a dose range of 2 \u2013 25 mg/kg. With an initial dose of 840 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 420 mg every three weeks thereafter, the steady-state concentration of pertuzumab was reached after the first maintenance dose. Elimination The median clearance (CL) of pertuzumab was 0.24 L/day and the median half-life was 18 days. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of pertuzumab were observed based on age, sex, ethnicity (Japanese vs. non-Japanese), or disease status (neoadjuvant or adjuvant vs. metastatic setting). No dose adjustments based on body weight or baseline albumin level are needed, as the exposure changes are not considered clinically relevant. Pertuzumab exposure in patients with mild (CLcr 60 to 90 mL/min, n=200) and moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 60 mL/min, n=71) were similar to those in patients with normal renal function (CLcr greater than 90 mL/min, n=200). The pharmacokinetics of pertuzumab in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment is unknown. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the incidence of ADA in other studies, including those of PERJETA or of other pertuzumab products. Patients in CLEOPATRA were tested at multiple time-points for anti-pertuzumab antibodies. 3% (13/389) of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 7% (25/372) of patients in the placebo-treated group tested positive for anti-pertuzumab antibodies. Of these 38 patients, none experienced anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reactions that were clearly related to anti-pertuzumab antibodies. The presence of pertuzumab in patient serum at the levels expected at the time of ADA sampling can interfere with the ability of this assay to detect anti-pertuzumab antibodies. In addition, the assay may be detecting antibodies to trastuzumab. As a result, data may not accurately reflect the true incidence of anti-pertuzumab antibody development. In the neoadjuvant period of BERENICE, 0.3% (1/383) of patients treated with PERJETA tested positive for anti-pertuzumab antibodies. This patient did not experience any anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reactions. Because of limited immunogenicity data, the clinical impact of anti-pertuzumab antibodies is unknown.

The serum half-life for cefazolin is approximately 1.8 hours following IV administration. In a study of constant intravenous infusion with dosages of 3.5 mg/kg for 1 hour (approximately 250 mg) and 1.5 mg/kg the next 2 hours (approximately 100 mg) in healthy volunteers, cefazolin serum concentrations at the third hour were approximately 28 mcg/mL.

Adenosine injection, USP is antagonized competitively by methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline, and potentiated by blockers of nucleoside transport such as dipyridamole. Adenosine injection, USP is not blocked by atropine. Hemodynamics The intravenous bolus dose of 6 mg or 12 mg adenosine injection, USP usually has no systemic hemodynamic effects. When larger doses are given by infusion, adenosine decreases blood pressure by decreasing peripheral resistance. Pharmacokinetics Intravenously administered adenosine is rapidly cleared from the circulation via cellular uptake, primarily by erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells. This process involves a specific transmembrane nucleoside carrier system that is reversible, nonconcentrative, and bidirectionally symmetrical. Intracellular adenosine is rapidly metabolized either via phosphorylation to adenosine monophosphate by adenosine kinase, or via deamination to inosine by adenosine deaminase in the cytosol. Since adenosine kinase has a lower Km and Vmax than adenosine deaminase, deamination plays a significant role only when cytosolic adenosine saturates the phosphorylation pathway. Inosine formed by deamination of adenosine can leave the cell intact or can be degraded to hypoxanthine, xanthine, and ultimately uric acid. Adenosine monophosphate formed by phosphorylation of adenosine is incorporated into the high-energy phosphate pool. While extracellular adenosine is primarily cleared by cellular uptake with a half-life of less than 10 seconds in whole blood, excessive amounts may be deaminated by an ecto-form of adenosine deaminase. As adenosine injection, USP requires no hepatic or renal function for its activation or inactivation, hepatic and renal failure would not be expected to alter its effectiveness or tolerability.

A cumulative 60% of patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia had converted to normal sinus rhythm within one minute after an intravenous bolus dose of 6 mg adenosine injection, USP (some converted on 3 mg and failures were given 6 mg), and a cumulative 92% converted after a bolus dose of 12 mg.

By the end of short-term intravenous infusion, peak serum concentrations of active clindamycin are reached. After intramuscular injection of clindamycin phosphate, peak concentrations of active clindamycin are reached within 3 hours in adults and 1 hour in pediatric patients. Serum concentrations of clindamycin can be maintained above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations for most indicated organisms by administration of clindamycin phosphate every 8 to 12 hours in adults and every 6 to 8 hours in pediatric patients, or by continuous intravenous infusion. An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose. No significant concentrations of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid even in the presence of inflamed meninges. Metabolism In vitro studies in human liver and intestinal microsomes indicated that clindamycin is predominantly metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with minor contribution from CYP3A5, to form clindamycin sulfoxide and a minor metabolite, N-desmethylclindamycin. Excretion Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears from the serum with 6 minutes of the average elimination half-life; however, the average serum elimination half-life of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2\u00bd hours in pediatric patients. Specific Populations Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules do not need to be modified in patients with renal or hepatic disease. Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61\u201379 years) and younger adults (18\u201339 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, the average elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4\u20135.1 h) in the elderly, compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1\u20134.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function1. Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients with PMA \u226432 weeks, or >32 to \u226440 weeks Systemic clearance (CL) in premature infants increases with increases in body weight (kg) and post-menstrual age (PMA). The dosing regimens for pediatric patients \u226432 weeks PMA (5 mg/kg) and >32 to \u226440 weeks PMA (7 mg/kg), both administered intravenously every 8 hours, achieve exposures comparable to therapeutic exposures in adults (weighing 70 kg) administered clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours (Table 1).

Obese Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to Less than 18 Years and Obese Adults Aged 18 to 20 Years An analysis of pharmacokinetic data in obese pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years and obese adults aged 18 to 20 years demonstrated that clindamycin clearance and volume of distribution, normalized by total body weight, are comparable regardless of obesity. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic. Resistance Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B.Macrolide-inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test. Antimicrobial Activity Clindamycin has been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ]: Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pyogenes Anaerobic bacteria Clostridium perfringens Fusobacterium necrophorum Fusobacterium nucleatum Peptostreptococcus anaerobius Prevotella melaninogenica The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for clindamycin against isolates of a similar genus or organism group.

Piperacillin plasma concentrations, following a 30-minute infusion of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection, were similar to those attained when equivalent doses of piperacillin were administered alone. Steady-state plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam were similar to those attained after the first dose due to the short half-lives of piperacillin and tazobactam. Distribution Both piperacillin and tazobactam are approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. The protein binding of either piperacillin or tazobactam is unaffected by the presence of the other compound. Protein binding of the tazobactam metabolite is negligible. Piperacillin and tazobactam are widely distributed into tissues and body fluids including intestinal mucosa, gallbladder, lung, female reproductive tissues (uterus, ovary, and fallopian tube), interstitial fluid, and bile. Mean tissue concentrations are generally 50% to 100% of those in plasma. Distribution of piperacillin and tazobactam into cerebrospinal fluid is low in subjects with non-inflamed meninges, as with other penicillins (see Table 8 ).

Tazobactam is metabolized to a single metabolite that lacks pharmacological and antibacterial activities. Excretion Following single piperacillin and tazobactam for injection doses to healthy subjects, the plasma half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 hours and was unaffected by dose or duration of infusion. Both piperacillin and tazobactam are eliminated via the kidney by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Piperacillin is excreted rapidly as unchanged drug with 68% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. Tazobactam and its metabolite are eliminated primarily by renal excretion with 80% of the administered dose excreted as unchanged drug and the remainder as the single metabolite. Piperacillin, tazobactam and desethyl piperacillin are also secreted into the bile. Specific Populations Renal Impairment After the administration of single doses of piperacillin/tazobactam to subjects with renal impairment, the half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. At creatinine clearance below 20 mL/min, the increase in half-life is twofold for piperacillin and fourfold for tazobactam compared to subjects with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments for piperacillin and tazobactam for injection are recommended when creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min in patients receiving the usual recommended daily dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection. See Dosage and Administration (2) for specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with renal impairment. Hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of a piperacillin/tazobactam dose with an additional 5% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. Peritoneal dialysis removes approximately 6% and 21% of the piperacillin and tazobactam doses, respectively, with up to 16% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. For dosage recommendations for patients undergoing hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Hepatic Impairment The half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases by approximately 25% and 18%, respectively, in patients with hepatic cirrhosis compared to healthy subjects. However, this difference does not warrant dosage adjustment of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection due to hepatic cirrhosis. Pediatrics Piperacillin and tazobactam pharmacokinetics were studied in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older. The clearance of both compounds is slower in the younger patients compared to older children and adults. In a population PK analysis, estimated clearance for 9 month-old to 12 year-old patients was comparable to adults, with a population mean (SE) value of 5.64 (0.34) mL/min/kg. The piperacillin clearance estimate is 80% of this value for pediatric patients 2 to 9 months old. In patients younger than 2 months of age, clearance of piperacillin is slower compared to older children; however, it is not adequately characterized for dosing recommendations. The population mean (SE) for piperacillin volume of distribution is 0.243 (0.011) L/kg and is independent of age. Geriatrics The impact of age on the pharmacokinetics of piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male subjects, aged 18 to 35 years (n=6) and aged 65 to 80 years (n=12). Mean half-life for piperacillin and tazobactam was 32% and 55% higher, respectively, in the elderly compared to the younger subjects. This difference may be due to age-related changes in creatinine clearance. Race The effect of race on piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male volunteers. No difference in piperacillin or tazobactam pharmacokinetics was observed between Asian (n=9) and Caucasian (n=9) healthy volunteers who received single 4/0.5 g doses. Drug Interactions The potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between piperacillin and tazobactam for injection and aminoglycosides, probenecid, vancomycin, heparin, vecuronium, and methotrexate has been evaluated [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Piperacillin sodium exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting septum formation and cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. In vitro , piperacillin is active against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Tazobactam sodium has little clinically relevant in vitro activity against bacteria due to its reduced affinity to penicillin-binding proteins. It is, however, a beta-lactamase inhibitor of the Molecular class A enzymes, including Richmond-Sykes class III (Bush class 2b & 2b') penicillinases and cephalosporinases. It varies in its ability to inhibit class II and IV (2a & 4) penicillinases. Tazobactam does not induce chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases at tazobactam concentrations achieved with the recommended dosage regimen. Antimicrobial Activity Piperacillin/tazobactam has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1) ] : Aerobic bacteria Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae (excluding beta-lactamase negative, ampicillin-resistant isolates) Klebsiella pneumoniae Pseudomonas aeruginosa (given in combination with an aminoglycoside to which the isolate is susceptible) Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis group ( B. fragilis , B. ovatus , B. thetaiotaomicron , and B. vulgatus ) The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for piperacillin/tazobactam against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Aerobic bacteria Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (ampicillin or penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae These are not beta-lactamase producing bacteria and, therefore, are susceptible to piperacillin alone.

A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem I.V. is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

Chemically, flumazenil is ethyl 8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a](1,4) benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate. Flumazenil has an imidazobenzodiazepine structure, a calculated molecular weight of 303.3, and the following structural formula: Flumazenil is a white to off-white crystalline compound with an octanol: buffer partition coefficient of 14 to 1 at pH 7.4. It is insoluble in water but slightly soluble in acidic aqueous solutions. Flumazenil injection is available as a sterile parenteral dosage form for intravenous administration. Each mL contains 0.1 mg of flumazenil compounded with 1.8 mg of methylparaben, 0.2 mg of propylparaben, 0.9% sodium chloride, 0.01% edetate disodium, and 0.01% acetic acid; the pH is adjusted to approximately 4 with hydrochloric acid and/or, if necessary, sodium hydroxide. Formula1.jpg"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, antagonizes the actions of benzodiazepines on the central nervous system. Flumazenil competitively inhibits the activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. Flumazenil is a weak partial agonist in some animal models of activity, but has little or no agonist activity in man. Flumazenil does not antagonize the central nervous system effects of drugs affecting GABA-ergic neurons by means other than the benzodiazepine receptor (including ethanol, barbiturates, or general anesthetics) and does not reverse the effects of opioids. In animals pretreated with high doses of benzodiazepines over several weeks, flumazenil elicited symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal, including seizures. A similar effect was seen in adult human subjects. Pharmacodynamics Intravenous flumazenil has been shown to antagonize sedation, impairment of recall, psychomotor impairment and ventilatory depression produced by benzodiazepines in healthy human volunteers. The duration and degree of reversal of sedative benzodiazepine effects are related to the dose and plasma concentrations of flumazenil as shown in the following data from a study in normal volunteers. Generally, doses of approximately 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg (corresponding to peak plasma levels of 3 to 6 ng/mL) produce partial antagonism, whereas higher doses of 0.4 to 1 mg (peak plasma levels of 12 to 28 ng/mL) usually produce complete antagonism in patients who have received the usual sedating doses of benzodiazepines. The onset of reversal is usually evident within 1 to 2 minutes after the injection is completed. Eighty percent response will be reached within 3 minutes, with the peak effect occurring at 6 to 10 minutes. The duration and degree of reversal are related to the plasma concentration of the sedating benzodiazepine as well as the dose of flumazenil given. In healthy volunteers, flumazenil did not alter intraocular pressure when given alone and reversed the decrease in intraocular pressure seen after administration of midazolam. Pharmacokinetics After IV administration, plasma concentrations of flumazenil follow a two-exponential decay model. The pharmacokinetics of flumazenil are dose-proportional up to 100 mg. Distribution Flumazenil is extensively distributed in the extravascular space with an initial distribution half-life of 4 to 11 minutes and a terminal half-life of 40 to 80 minutes. Peak concentrations of flumazenil are proportional to dose, with an apparent initial volume of distribution of 0.5 L/kg. The volume of distribution at steady-state is 0.9 to 1.1 L/kg. Flumazenil is a weak lipophilic base. Protein binding is approximately 50% and the drug shows no preferential partitioning into red blood cells. Albumin accounts for two thirds of plasma protein binding. Metabolism Flumazenil is completely (99%) metabolized. Very little unchanged flumazenil (< 1%) is found in the urine. The major metabolites of flumazenil identified in urine are the de-ethylated free acid and its glucuronide conjugate. In preclinical studies there was no evidence of pharmacologic activity exhibited by the de-ethylated free acid. Elimination Elimination of radiolabeled drug is essentially complete within 72 hours, with 90% to 95% of the radioactivity appearing in urine and 5% to 10% in the feces. Clearance of flumazenil occurs primarily by hepatic metabolism and is dependent on hepatic blood flow. In pharmacokinetic studies of normal volunteers, total clearance ranged from 0.8 to 1.0 L/hr/kg. Pharmacokinetic parameters following a 5-minute infusion of a total of 1 mg of flumazenil mean (coefficient of variation, range): Food Effects Ingestion of food during an intravenous infusion of the drug results in a 50% increase in clearance, most likely due to the increased hepatic blood flow that accompanies a meal. Special Populations The Elderly: The pharmacokinetics of flumazenil are not significantly altered in the elderly. Gender: The pharmacokinetics of flumazenil are not different in male and female subjects. Renal Failure (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min) and Hemodialysis: The pharmacokinetics of flumazenil are not significantly affected. Patients With Liver Dysfunction: For patients with moderate liver dysfunction, their mean total clearance is decreased to 40% to 60% and in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is decreased to 25% of normal value, compared with age-matched healthy subjects. This results in a prolongation of the half-life to 1.3 hours in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and 2.4 hours in severely impaired patients. Caution should be exercised with initial and/or repeated dosing to patients with liver disease. Drug-Drug Interaction: The pharmacokinetic profile of flumazenil is unaltered in the presence of benzodiazepine agonists and the kinetic profiles of those benzodiazepines studied (i.e., diazepam, flunitrazepam, lormetazepam, and midazolam) are unaltered by flumazenil. During the 4-hour steady-state and post infusion of ethanol, there were no pharmacokinetic interactions on ethanol mean plasma levels as compared to placebo when flumazenil doses were given intravenously (at 2.5 hours and 6 hours) nor were interactions of ethanol on the flumazenil elimination half-life found. Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of flumazenil have been evaluated in 29 pediatric patients ranging in age from 1 to 17 years who had undergone minor surgical procedures. The average doses administered were 0.53 mg (0.044 mg/kg) in patients aged 1 to 5years, 0.63 mg (0.020 mg/kg) in patients aged 6 to 12 years, and 0.8 mg (0.014 mg/kg) in patients aged 13 to 17 years. Compared to adults, the elimination half-life in pediatric patients was more variable, averaging 40 minutes (range: 20 to 75 minutes). Clearance and volume of distribution, normalized for body weight, were in the same range as those seen in adults, although more variability was seen in the pediatric patients.

Single doses of acetaminophen injection up to 3000 mg and repeated doses of 1000 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours have not been shown to cause a significant effect on platelet aggregation. Acetaminophen does not have any immediate or delayed effects on small-vessel hemostasis. Clinical studies of both healthy subjects and patients with hemophilia showed no significant changes in bleeding time after receiving multiple doses of oral acetaminophen. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen injection has been studied in patients and healthy subjects up to 60 years old. The pharmacokinetic profile of acetaminophen injection has been demonstrated to be dose proportional in adults following administration of single doses of 500, 650, and 1000 mg. The maximum concentration (C max ) occurs at the end of the 15 minute intravenous infusion of acetaminophen injection. Compared to the same dose of oral acetaminophen, the C max following administration of acetaminophen injection is up to 70% higher, while overall exposure (area under the concentration time curve [AUC]) is very similar.

At therapeutic levels, binding of acetaminophen to plasma proteins is low (ranging from 10% to 25%). Acetaminophen appears to be widely distributed throughout most body tissues except fat. Metabolism and Excretion Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver by first-order kinetics and involves three principal separate pathways: Conjugation with glucuronide, conjugation with sulfate, and oxidation via the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway, primarily CYP2E1, to form a reactive intermediate metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine or NAPQI). With therapeutic doses, NAPQI undergoes rapid conjugation with glutathione and is then further metabolized to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.

The electrolyte composition approaches that of the principal ions of normal plasma (extracellular fluid). The electrolyte concentration is approximately isotonic in relation to the extracellular fluid (approx. 280 mOsmol/liter) and provides a physiologic sodium to chloride ratio, normal plasma concentrations of potassium and magnesium and two bicarbonate alternates, acetate and gluconate. Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl\u00af) ions. Sodium (Na + ) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl\u00af) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl\u00af) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output. Potassium chloride in water dissociates to provide potassium (K + ) and chloride (Cl\u00af) ions. Potassium is the chief cation of body cells (160 mEq/liter of intracellular water). It is found in low concentration in plasma and extracellular fluids (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter in a healthy adult and child over 10 days old; 3.5 to 6.0 mEq/liter in a child less than 10 days old). Potassium plays an important role in electrolyte balance. Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium-free diet, potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion. Magnesium chloride in water dissociates to provide magnesium (Mg ++ ) and chloride (Cl\u00af) ions. Magnesium is the second most plentiful cation of the intracellular fluids. It is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Normal plasma concentration ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 or 3.0 mEq/liter. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration. Sodium acetate provides sodium (Na + ) and acetate (CH 3 COO\u00af) ions, the latter anion (a source of hydrogen ion acceptors) serving as an alternate source of bicarbonate (HCO 3 \u00af) by metabolic conversion in the liver. This has been shown to proceed readily even in the presence of severe liver disease. Thus, acetate anion exerts a mild systemic antiacidotic action that may be advantageous during fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy. Sodium gluconate provides sodium (Na + ) and gluconate (C 6 H 11 O 7 \u00af) ions. Although gluconate is a theoretical alternate metabolic source of bicarbonate (HCO 3 \u00af) anion, a significant antiacidotic action has not been established. Thus, the gluconate anion serves primarily to complete the cation-anion balance of the solutions. Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Distribution Aprepitant is greater than 95% bound to plasma proteins. The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vd ss ) was approximately 70 L in humans. Aprepitant crosses the blood brain barrier in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . Elimination Metabolism Fosaprepitant is converted to aprepitant in in vitro incubations with human liver preparations and in S9 preparations from multiple other human tissues including kidney, lung and ileum. Thus, it appears that the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant can occur in multiple extrahepatic tissues in addition to the liver. Aprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Metabolism is largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side chains. No metabolism by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, or CYP2E1 was detected. In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for approximately 24% of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single oral 300-mg dose of [ 14 C]-aprepitant, indicating a substantial presence of metabolites in the plasma. Seven metabolites of aprepitant, which are only weakly active, have been identified in human plasma. Excretion Following administration of a single intravenous 100-mg dose of [ 14 C]-fosaprepitant to healthy subjects, 57% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 45% in feces. Aprepitant is eliminated primarily by metabolism; aprepitant is not renally excreted. The apparent terminal half-life ranged from approximately 9 to 13 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following oral administration of a single 125-mg dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 through 5, the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 21% higher on Day 1 and 36% higher on Day 5 in healthy elderly subjects (65 years and older) relative to younger adult subjects. The C max was 10% higher on Day 1 and 24% higher on Day 5 in healthy elderly subjects relative to younger adult subjects. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Pediatric Patients Single-Dose Intravenous Fosaprepitant Regimen : Simulated systemic exposures of aprepitant in patients 2 years to less than 12 years and observed systemic exposures in patients 6 months to less than 2 years and 12 to 17 years are shown in Table 9, including AUC 0-24hr , peak plasma concentration (C max ) on Day 1 and concentrations at the end of Day 1 (C 24 ), Day 2 (C 48 ) and Day 3 (C 72 ).

The geometric mean could not be estimated due to values being below the limitation of quantification. Plasma concentrations of fosaprepitant are negligible within 15-30 minutes after the completion of the infusion in pediatric patients. Male and Female Patients Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant, ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg, the AUC 0-24hr and C max are 9% and 17% higher in females as compared with males. The half-life of aprepitant is approximately 25% lower in females as compared with males and T max occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. A population pharmacokinetic analysis of aprepitant in pediatric patients (6 months to 17 years) suggests that sex has no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant. Racial and Ethnic Groups Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant, ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg, the AUC 0-24hr and C max are approximately 27% and 19% higher in Hispanics as compared with Caucasians. The AUC 0-24hr and C max were 74% and 47% higher in Asians as compared to Caucasians. There was no difference in AUC 0-24hr or C max between Caucasians and Blacks. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. A population pharmacokinetic analysis of aprepitant in pediatric patients (6 months to 17 years) suggests that race has no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant. Patients with Renal Impairment A single 240-mg oral dose of aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis. In patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC 0-\u221e of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound) decreased by 21% and C max decreased by 32%, relative to healthy subjects (creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault method). In patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis, the AUC 0-\u221e of total aprepitant decreased by 42% and C max decreased by 32%. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the AUC of pharmacologically active unbound drug was not significantly affected in patients with renal impairment compared with healthy subjects. Hemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2% of the dose was recovered in the dialysate. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Fosaprepitant is metabolized in various extrahepatic tissues; therefore, hepatic impairment is not expected to alter the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant. Following administration of a single 125-mg oral dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3 to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6), the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 11% lower on Day 1 and 36% lower on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 10% higher on Day 1 and 18% higher on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. These differences in AUC 0-24hr are not considered clinically meaningful. There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Body Mass Index (BMI) For every 5 kg/m 2 increase in BMI, AUC 0-24hr and C max of aprepitant decrease by 9% and 10%. BMI of subjects in the analysis ranged from 18 kg/m 2 to 36 kg/m 2 . This change is not considered clinically meaningful. Drug Interaction Studies Fosaprepitant, given as a single 150-mg dose, is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, with no evidence of inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 observed on Day 4. The weak inhibition of CYP3A4 continues for 2 days after single dose administration of fosaprepitant. Aprepitant is a substrate, an inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9. Fosaprepitant or aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the Pglycoprotein transporter. Effects of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Midazolam: Fosaprepitant 150 mg administered as a single intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC 0-\u221e of midazolam by approximately 1.8-fold on Day 1 and had no effect on Day 4 when midazolam was coadministered as a single oral dose of 2 mg on Days 1 and 4 [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone: Fosaprepitant administered as a single 150 mg intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC 0-24hr of dexamethasone, administered as a single 8-mg oral dose on Days 1, 2, and 3, by approximately 2-fold on Days 1 and 2 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Methylprednisolone: When oral aprepitant as a 3-day regimen (125-mg/80-mg/80-mg) was administered with intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg on Day 1 and oral methylprednisolone 40 mg on Days 2 and 3, the AUC of methylprednisolone was increased by 1.34-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3 [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Chemotherapeutic agents: Docetaxel: In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant administered as a 3-day regimen (125mg/80-mg/80-mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Vinorelbine: In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant administered as a 3-day regimen (125mg/80-mg/80-mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine to a clinically significant degree. Oral contraceptives: When oral aprepitant was administered as a 3-day regimen (125-mg/80mg/80-mg) with ondansetron and dexamethasone, and coadministered with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, the trough concentrations of both ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone were reduced by as much as 64% for 3 weeks post-treatment [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . CYP2C9 substrates (Warfarin, Tolbutamide): Warfarin: A single 125-mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to subjects who were stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy. Although there was no effect of oral aprepitant on the plasma AUC of R(+) or S(-) warfarin determined on Day 3, there was a 34% decrease in S(-) warfarin trough concentration accompanied by a 14% decrease in the prothrombin time (reported as International Normalized Ratio or INR) 5 days after completion of dosing with oral aprepitant [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Tolbutamide: Oral aprepitant, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of tolbutamide by 23% on Day 4, 28% on Day 8, and 15% on Day 15, when a single dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered prior to the administration of the 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant and on Days 4, 8, and 15. This effect was not considered clinically important. Other Drugs P-glycoprotein substrates: Aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the Pglycoprotein transporter, as demonstrated by the lack of interaction of oral aprepitant with digoxin in a clinical drug interaction study. 5-HT 3 antagonists: In clinical drug interaction studies, aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron, granisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of dolasetron). Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant Rifampin: When a single 375-mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14-day regimen of 600 mg/day of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased approximately 11-fold and the mean terminal half-life decreased approximately 3-fold [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Ketoconazole: When a single 125-mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Diltiazem: In a study in 10 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of 100 mg of fosaprepitant as an intravenous infusion with 120 mg of diltiazem, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor administered three times daily, resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the aprepitant AUC and a 1.4-fold increase in the diltiazem AUC. When fosaprepitant was administered with diltiazem, the mean maximum decrease in diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater than that observed with diltiazem alone [24.3 \u00b1 10.2 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 15.6 \u00b1 4.1 mm Hg without fosaprepitant]. The mean maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure was also greater after co-administration of diltiazem with fosaprepitant than administration of diltiazem alone [29.5 \u00b1 7.9 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 23.8 \u00b1 4.8 mm Hg without fosaprepitant]. Co-administration of fosaprepitant and diltiazem; however, did not result in any additional clinically significant changes in heart rate or PR interval, beyond those changes observed with diltiazem alone [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. Paroxetine: Coadministration of once daily doses of oral aprepitant 170 mg, with paroxetine 20 mg once daily, resulted in a decrease in AUC by approximately 25% and C max by approximately 20% of both aprepitant and paroxetine. This effect was not considered clinically important. Additional pediatric use information is approved for Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC\u2019s EMEND (fosaprepitant) for injection.

Clofarabine has affinity for the activating phosphorylating enzyme, deoxycytidine kinase, equal to or greater than that of the natural substrate, deoxycytidine. Clofarabine inhibits DNA synthesis by decreasing cellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools through an inhibitory action on ribonucleotide reductase, and by terminating DNA chain elongation and inhibiting repair through incorporation into the DNA chain by competitive inhibition of DNA polymerases. The affinity of clofarabine triphosphate for these enzymes is similar to or greater than that of deoxyadenosine triphosphate. In preclinical models, clofarabine has demonstrated the ability to inhibit DNA repair by incorporation into the DNA chain during the repair process. Clofarabine 5\u2019-triphosphate also disrupts the integrity of mitochondrial membrane, leading to the release of the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor, leading to programmed cell death. Clofarabine is cytotoxic to rapidly proliferating and quiescent cancer cell types in vitro . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The population pharmacokinetics of clofarabine were studied in 40 pediatric patients aged 2 to 19 years (21 males/19 females) with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). At the given 52 mg/m 2 dose, similar concentrations were obtained over a wide range of body surface areas (BSAs). Clofarabine was 47% bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to albumin. Based on non-compartmental analysis, systemic clearance and volume of distribution at steady-state were 28.8 L/h/m 2 and 172 L/m 2 , respectively. The terminal half-life was 5.2 hours. No apparent difference in pharmacokinetics was observed between patients with ALL and AML or between males and females. No relationship between clofarabine or clofarabine triphosphate exposure and toxicity or response was found in this population. Based on 24-hour urine collections in the pediatric studies, 49% to 60% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged. In vitro studies using isolated human hepatocytes indicate very limited metabolism (0.2%). The pathways of non-hepatic elimination remain unknown. Clofarabine has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Drug-Drug Interactions In vitro studies suggested that clofarabine undergoes limited metabolism and does not inhibit or induce major CYP enzymes. CYP inhibitors and inducers are unlikely to affect the metabolism of clofarabine. Clofarabine is unlikely to affect the metabolism of CYP substrates. However, no in vivo drug interaction studies have been conducted. An in vitro transporter study suggested that clofarabine is a substrate of human transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OCT1. A preclinical study using perfused rat kidney demonstrated that the renal excretion of clofarabine was decreased by cimetidine, an inhibitor of the hOCT2. Although the clinical implications of this finding have not been determined, signs of clofarabine toxicity should be monitored when administered with other hOAT1, hOAT3, hOCT1 and hOCT2 substrates or inhibitors."], "manufacturer_name": ["Eugia US LLC"], "substance_name": ["CLOFARABINE"], "effective_time": "20221010", "product_ndc": ["55150-326"], "brand_name": ["CLOFARABINE"]}

The perioperative use of cefazolin for injection may also be effective in surgical patients in whom infection at the operative site would present a serious risk (e.g., during open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty). The prophylactic administration of cefazolin for injection should usually be discontinued within a 24-hour period after the surgical procedure. In surgery where the occurrence of infection may be particularly devastating (e.g., open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty), the prophylactic administration of cefazolin for injection may be continued for 3 to 5 days following the completion of surgery. If there are signs of infection, specimens for cultures should be obtained for the identification of the causative organism so that appropriate therapy may be instituted.

Studies have shown that following intravenous administration of cefazolin for injection to normal volunteers, mean serum concentrations peaked at approximately 185 mcg/mL and were approximately 4 mcg/mL at 8 hours for a 1-gram dose. The serum half-life for cefazolin is approximately 1.8 hours following intravenous administration and approximately 2 hours following intramuscular administration. In a study (using normal volunteers) of constant intravenous infusion with dosages of 3.5 mg/kg for one hour (approximately 250 mg) and 1.5 mg/kg the next 2 hours (approximately 100 mg), cefazolin produced a steady serum level at the third hour of approximately 28 mcg/mL. Studies in patients hospitalized with infections indicate that cefazolin produces mean peak serum levels approximately equivalent to those seen in normal volunteers. Bile levels in patients without obstructive biliary disease can reach or exceed serum levels by up to five times; however, in patients with obstructive biliary disease, bile levels of cefazolin are considerably lower than serum levels (< 1 mcg/mL). In synovial fluid, the level of cefazolin becomes comparable to that reached in serum at about 4 hours after drug administration. Studies of cord blood show prompt transfer of cefazolin across the placenta. Cefazolin is present in very low concentrations in the milk of nursing mothers. Cefazolin is excreted unchanged in the urine. In the first 6 hours approximately 60% of the drug is excreted in the urine and this increases to 70% to 80% within 24 hours. Cefazolin achieves peak urine concentrations of approximately 2,400 mcg/mL and 4,000 mcg/mL, respectively following 500-mg and 1-gram intramuscular doses. In patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (2L/hour.), cefazolin produced mean serum levels of approximately 10 and 30 mcg/mL after 24 hours\u2019 instillation of a dialyzing solution containing 50 mg/L and 150 mg/L, respectively.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Nicardipine produces significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of less than 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and less than 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 \u00b1 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 \u00b1 1 bpm in patients with severe hypertension at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In congestive heart failure patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine increased cardiac output both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure. \u201cCoronary steal\u201d has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine capsules. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.) In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. *PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system. Hepatic Function Because nicardipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with nicardipine capsules in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatic disease when nicardipine hydrochloride was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr. Renal Function When nicardipine was given to mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of renal impairment, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) were observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. When nicardipine capsules (20 or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with impaired renal function, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C max were approximately two-fold higher than in healthy controls. There was a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type ll diabetic patients with nephropathy, nicardipine capsules (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal vascular resistance. Pulmonary Function In two well-controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with nicardipine capsules, no evidence of increased bronchospasm was seen. In one of the studies, nicardipine capsules improved forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison with metoprolol. Adverse reactions reported in a limited number of patients with asthma, reactive airway disease, or obstructive airway disease were similar to reactions in other patients treated with nicardipine capsules. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution A rapid dose-related increase in nicardipine plasma concentrations is seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (greater than 65 years) and young healthy adults. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations. Nicardipine is highly protein bound (greater than 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline triexponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (\u03b1-half-life of 3 minutes), an intermediate phase (\u00df-half-life of 45 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (\u01b4-half-life of 14 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hr\u2022kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine is linear over the dosage range of 0.5 mg/hr to 40 mg/hr. Metabolism and Excretion Nicardipine has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, 2D6, and 3A4. Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism; however, nicardipine has been shown to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19). Inhibition of these enzymes may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )]. The altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dosage adjustment of the affected drug or discontinuation of treatment. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine."], "manufacturer_name": ["Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc."], "substance_name": ["NICARDIPINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240824", "product_ndc": ["0143-9633", "0143-9689", "0143-9634"], "brand_name": ["Nicardipine Hydrochloride"]}

The accumulation of amyloid beta plaques in the brain is a defining pathophysiological feature of Alzheimer's disease. Donanemab-azbt reduces amyloid beta plaques, as evaluated in Study 1 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect of KISUNLA on Amyloid Beta Pathology The effect of KISUNLA on amyloid beta plaque levels in the brain was evaluated using amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging ( 18 F-florbetapir tracer). The PET signal was quantified using the Standard Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) method to estimate brain levels of amyloid beta plaque in composites of brain areas expected to be widely affected by Alzheimer's disease pathology (precuneus, frontal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, parietal, and temporal cortices), compared to a brain region expected to be spared of such pathology (cerebellum). Results of amyloid PET were also expressed on the Centiloid scale. In Study 1 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , KISUNLA reduced amyloid beta plaque levels in the brain in a time-dependent manner, starting at Week 24, and continuing through Week 76 (p<0.0001), compared to placebo ( see Figure 1 and Table 7 ). In clinical pharmacology studies, KISUNLA demonstrated a dose- and time-dependent reduction in amyloid beta plaque, with the decrease observed starting at Week 12.

An association between reduction in amyloid beta plaque from baseline and clinical decline on iADRS and CDR-SB was also observed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics (PK) of KISUNLA were characterized using a population PK analysis with concentration data collected from 2131 patients with Alzheimer's disease who received KISUNLA in single or multiple doses. Accumulation of <1.3-fold occurs with every-4-week dosing; steady-state exposures are achieved after a single dose. In single doses from 10 to 40 mg/kg (~2 times the approved recommended dosage of 1400 mg for 70 kg of body weight), and multiple 10 and 20 mg/kg doses, exposures (C max and AUC) increased proportionally. Distribution The central volume of distribution is 3.36 L. Elimination KISUNLA is expected to be degraded by proteolytic enzymes in the same manner as endogenous IgG. The mean terminal half-life of donanemab-azbt is approximately 12.1 days. Donanemab-azbt clearance is 0.0255 L/h. Specific Populations Age, sex, or race were not found to affect the pharmacokinetics of donanemab-azbt. While body weight was found to influence both clearance and volume of distribution, the resulting changes were not clinically significant. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of donanemab-azbt in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Donanemab-azbt is degraded by proteolytic enzymes and is not expected to undergo renal elimination or metabolism by hepatic enzymes. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the incidence of ADAs in other studies, including those of donanemab-azbt or of other donanemab products. In up to 18 months of treatment in Study 1, 87% (691/792) of patients receiving KISUNLA once monthly developed anti-donanemab-azbt antibodies, and of those, 100% (691/691) had neutralizing antibodies. Anti-donanemab-azbt antibody formation was associated with a higher incidence of infusion-related reactions compared to placebo [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics The presence of anti-donanemab-azbt antibodies increased donanemab-azbt clearance.

It is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient. This solution also contains lactate which produces a metabolic alkalinizing effect. Sodium, the major cation of the extracellular fluid, functions primarily in the control of water distribution, fluid balance and osmotic pressure of body fluids. Sodium is also associated with chloride and bicarbonate in the regulation of the acid-base equilibrium of body fluid. Potassium, the principal cation of intracellular fluid, participates in carbohydrate utilization and protein synthesis, and is critical in the regulation of nerve conduction and muscle contraction, particularly in the heart. Chloride, the major extracellular anion, closely follows the metabolism of sodium, and changes in the acid-base balance of the body are reflected by changes in the chloride concentration. Calcium, an important cation, provides the framework of bones and teeth in the form of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. In the ionized form, calcium is essential for the functional mechanism of the clotting of blood, normal cardiac function, and regulation of neuromuscular irritability. Sodium lactate is a racemic salt containing both the levo form, which is oxidized by the liver to bicarbonate, and the dextro form, which is converted to glycogen. Lactate is slowly metabolized to carbon dioxide and water, accepting one hydrogen ion and resulting in the formation of bicarbonate for the lactate consumed. These reactions depend on oxidative cellular activity. Dextrose provides a source of calories. Dextrose is readily metabolized, may decrease losses of body protein and nitrogen, promotes glycogen deposition and decreases or prevents ketosis if sufficient doses are provided."], "manufacturer_name": ["B.

When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Ceftriaxone for injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms: Lower Respiratory Tract Infections Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis or Serratia marcescens . Acute Bacterial Otitis Media Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains) or Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains). NOTE: In one study lower clinical cure rates were observed with a single dose of ceftriaxone compared to 10 days of oral therapy. In a second study comparable cure rates were observed between single dose ceftriaxone and the comparator. The potentially lower clinical cure rate of ceftriaxone should be balanced against the potential advantages of parenteral therapy (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). Skin and Skin Structure Infections Caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes , Viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii * , Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis * or Peptostreptococcus species. Urinary Tract Infections (complicated and uncomplicated) Caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii or Klebsiella pneumoniae . Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral and rectal) Caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae , including both penicillinase- and nonpenicillinase-producing strains, and pharyngeal gonorrhea caused by nonpenicillinase-producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Ceftriaxone sodium, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis . Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added. Bacterial Septicemia Caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae or Klebsiella pneumoniae . Bone and Joint Infections Caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Enterobacter species. Intra-abdominal Infections Caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium species (Note: most strains of Clostridium difficile are resistant) or Peptostreptococcus species. Meningitis Caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae .

Pharmacokinetics in the Middle Ear Fluid In one study, total ceftriaxone concentrations (bound and unbound) were measured in middle ear fluid obtained during the insertion of tympanostomy tubes in 42 pediatric patients with otitis media. Sampling times were from 1 to 50 hours after a single intramuscular injection of 50 mg/kg of ceftriaxone. Mean (\u00b1SD) ceftriaxone levels in the middle ear reached a peak of 35 (\u00b112) mcg/mL at 24 hours, and remained at 19 (\u00b17) mcg/mL at 48 hours. Based on middle ear fluid ceftriaxone concentrations in the 23 to 25 hour and the 46 to 50 hour sampling time intervals, a half-life of 25 hours was calculated. Ceftriaxone is highly bound to plasma proteins. The extent of binding to proteins in the middle ear fluid is unknown. Interaction with Calcium Two in vitro studies, one using adult plasma and the other neonatal plasma from umbilical cord blood have been carried out to assess interaction of ceftriaxone and calcium. Ceftriaxone concentrations up to 1 mM (in excess of concentrations achieved in vivo following administration of 2 grams ceftriaxone infused over 30 minutes) were used in combination with calcium concentrations up to 12 mM (48 mg/dL). Recovery of ceftriaxone from plasma was reduced with calcium concentrations of 6 mM (24 mg/dL) or higher in adult plasma or 4 mM (16 mg/dL) or higher in neonatal plasma. This may be reflective of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitation. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Ceftriaxone is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Ceftriaxone has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Grampositive bacteria. Mechanism of Resistance Resistance to ceftriaxone is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In an in vitro study antagonistic effects have been observed with the combination of chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone. Antibacterial Activity Ceftriaxone has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1) section: \u2022 Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Enterobacter aerogenes Enterobacter cloacae Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Haemophilus parainfluenzae Klebsiella oxytoca Klebsiella pneumoniae Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Pseudomonas aeruginosa Serratia marcescens \u2022 Gram-positive Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci \u2022 Anaerobic Bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Clostridium species Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown .

Bortezomib Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro . Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following twice weekly administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 bortezomib doses, the maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (relative to baseline) in whole blood was observed five minutes after drug administration. Comparable maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was observed between 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses. Maximal inhibition ranged from 70% to 84% and from 73% to 83% for the 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 dose regimens, respectively. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 doses, the mean maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib (C max ) after the first dose (Day 1) were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively. When administered twice weekly, the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1 mg/m 2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m 2 dose to patients with multiple myeloma, the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC last ) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The AUC last geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) was 0.99 (0.80 to 1.23). The C max after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/mL) was lower than after intravenous administration (223 ng/mL) with repeat dose administration. Distribution The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 L/m 2 following single- or repeat-dose administration of 1 mg/m 2 or 1.3mg/m 2 to patients with multiple myeloma. The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg/m2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1.3 mg/m 2 dose. The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg/m 2 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1.3 mg/m 2 , respectively. Metabolism Bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized to several inactive metabolites in vitro via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. Excretion The pathways of elimination of bortezomib have not been characterized in humans. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were observed based on age, sex, or renal impairment (including patients administered Bortezomib for injection after dialysis). The effect of race on bortezomib pharmacokinetics is unknown. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following administration of bortezomib doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/m 2 , mild (total bilirubin \u22641x ULN and AST >ULN, or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment did not alter dose-normalized bortezomib AUC when compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Dose normalized mean bortezomib AUC increased by approximately 60% in patients with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3x ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose is recommended in patients with moderate or severe (total bilirubin >3x ULN and any AST) hepatic hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinically significant differences in bortezomib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with dexamethasone (weak CYP3A4 inducer), omeprazole (strong CYP2C19 inhibitor), or melphalan in combination with prednisone. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor Coadministration with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased bortezomib exposure by 35%.

The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with daptomycin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Daptomycin Administered over a 30-Minute Period in Adults The mean and standard deviation (SD) pharmacokinetic parameters of daptomycin at steady-state following intravenous (IV) administration of daptomycin over a 30-minute period at 4 to 12 mg/kg every 24h to healthy young adults are summarized in Table 11 .

Steady-state trough concentrations were achieved by the third daily dose. The mean (SD) steady-state trough concentrations attained following the administration of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg every 24h were 5.9 (1.6), 6.7 (1.6), 10.3 (5.5), 12.9 (2.9), and 13.7 (5.2) mcg/mL, respectively. Daptomycin Administered over a 2-Minute Period in Adults Following IV administration of daptomycin over a 2-minute period to healthy adult volunteers at doses of 4 mg/kg (N=8) and 6 mg/kg (N=12), the mean (SD) steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) values were 475 (71) and 701 (82) mcg\u2022h/mL, respectively. Values for maximum plasma concentration (C max ) at the end of the 2-minute period could not be determined adequately in this study. However, using pharmacokinetic parameters from 14 healthy adult volunteers who received a single dose of daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 30-minute period in a separate study, steady-state C max values were simulated for daptomycin 4 and 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 2-minute period. The simulated mean (SD) steady-state C max values were 77.7 (8.1) and 116.6 (12.2) mcg/mL, respectively. Distribution Daptomycin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin, in a concentration-independent manner. The overall mean binding ranges from 90 to 93%. In clinical studies, mean serum protein binding in adult subjects with creatinine clearance (CL CR ) \u226530 mL/min was comparable to that observed in healthy adult subjects with normal renal function. However, there was a trend toward decreasing serum protein binding among subjects with CL CR <30 mL/min (88%), including those receiving hemodialysis (86%) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (84%). The protein binding of daptomycin in adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was similar to that in healthy adult subjects. The volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) of daptomycin in healthy adult subjects was approximately 0.1 L/kg and was independent of dose. Metabolism In in vitro studies, daptomycin was not metabolized by human liver microsomes. In 5 healthy adults after infusion of radiolabeled 14 C-daptomycin, the plasma total radioactivity was similar to the concentration determined by microbiological assay. Inactive metabolites were detected in urine, as determined by the difference between total radioactive concentrations and microbiologically active concentrations. In a separate study, no metabolites were observed in plasma on Day 1 following the administration of daptomycin at 6 mg/kg to adult subjects. Minor amounts of three oxidative metabolites and one unidentified compound were detected in urine. The site of metabolism has not been identified. Excretion Daptomycin is excreted primarily by the kidneys. In a mass balance study of 5 healthy adult subjects using radiolabeled daptomycin, approximately 78% of the administered dose was recovered from urine based on total radioactivity (approximately 52% of the dose based on microbiologically active concentrations), and 5.7% of the administered dose was recovered from feces (collected for up to 9 days) based on total radioactivity. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Population-derived pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for infected adult patients (complicated skin and skin structure infections [cSSSI] and S. aureus bacteremia) and noninfected adult subjects with various degrees of renal function ( Table 12 ). Total plasma clearance (CL T ), elimination half-life (t 1/2 ), and volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) in patients with cSSSI were similar to those in patients with S. aureus bacteremia. Following administration of daptomycin 4 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean CL T was 9%, 22%, and 46% lower among subjects and patients with mild (CL CR 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (CL CR 30 to <50 mL/min), and severe (CL CR <30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, than in those with normal renal function (CL CR >80 mL/min). The mean steady-state systemic exposure (AUC), t 1/2 , and V ss increased with decreasing renal function, although the mean AUC for patients with CL CR 30 to 80 mL/min was not markedly different from the mean AUC for patients with normal renal function. The mean AUC for patients with CL CR <30 mL/min and for patients on dialysis (CAPD and hemodialysis dosed post-dialysis) was approximately 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, than for patients with normal renal function. The mean C max ranged from 60 to 70 mcg/mL in patients with CL CR \u226530 mL/min, while the mean C max for patients with CL CR <30 mL/min ranged from 41 to 58 mcg/mL. After administration of daptomycin 6 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean C max ranged from 80 to 114 mcg/mL in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and was similar to that of patients with normal renal function.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 10 adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and compared with those in healthy adult volunteers (N=9) matched for gender, age, and weight. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were not altered in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is warranted when daptomycin is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been evaluated. Gender No clinically significant gender-related differences in daptomycin pharmacokinetics have been observed. No dosage adjustment is warranted based on gender when daptomycin is administered. Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 12 healthy elderly subjects (\u226575 years of age) and 11 healthy young adult controls (18 to 30 years of age). Following administration of a single 4 mg/kg dose of daptomycin by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean total clearance of daptomycin was approximately 35% lower and the mean AUC 0-\u221e was approximately 58% higher in elderly subjects than in healthy young adult subjects. There were no differences in C max [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Obese Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 6 moderately obese (Body Mass Index [BMI] 25 to 39.9 kg/m 2 ) and 6 extremely obese (BMI \u226540 kg/m 2 ) adult subjects and controls matched for age, gender, and renal function. Following administration of daptomycin by IV infusion over a 30-minute period as a single 4 mg/kg dose based on total body weight, the total plasma clearance of daptomycin normalized to total body weight was approximately 15% lower in moderately obese subjects and 23% lower in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The AUC 0-\u221e of daptomycin was approximately 30% higher in moderately obese subjects and 31% higher in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The differences were most likely due to differences in the renal clearance of daptomycin. No adjustment of daptomycin dosage is warranted in obese patients. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric subjects was evaluated in 3 single-dose pharmacokinetic studies. In general, body weight-normalized total body clearance in pediatric patients was higher than in adults and increased with a decrease of age, whereas elimination half-life tends to decrease with a decrease of age. Body weight-normalized total body clearance and elimination half-life of daptomycin in children 2 to 6 years of age were similar at different doses. A study was conducted to assess safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric patients (1 to 17 years old, inclusive) with cSSSI caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Patients were enrolled into 4 age groups [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , and intravenous daptomycin doses of 5 to 10 mg/kg once daily were administered. Following administration of multiple doses, daptomycin exposure (AUC ss and C max,ss ) was similar across different age groups after dose adjustment based on body weight and age ( Table 13 ).

Following administration of multiple doses, daptomycin exposure (AUC ss and C max,ss ) was similar across different age groups after dose adjustment based on body weight and age ( Table 14 ).

It is unlikely that daptomycin will inhibit or induce the metabolism of drugs metabolized by the P450 system. Aztreonam In a study in which 15 healthy adult subjects received a single dose of daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV and a combination dose of daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV and aztreonam 1 g IV, administered over a 30-minute period, the C max and AUC 0-\u221e of daptomycin were not significantly altered by aztreonam. Tobramycin In a study in which 6 healthy adult males received a single dose of daptomycin 2 mg/kg IV, tobramycin 1 mg/kg IV, and both in combination, administered over a 30-minute period, the mean C max and AUC 0-\u221e of daptomycin were 12.7% and 8.7% higher, respectively, when daptomycin was coadministered with tobramycin. The mean C max and AUC 0-\u221e of tobramycin were 10.7% and 6.6% lower, respectively, when tobramycin was coadministered with daptomycin. These differences were not statistically significant. The interaction between daptomycin and tobramycin with a clinical dose of daptomycin is unknown. Warfarin In 16 healthy adult subjects, administration of daptomycin 6 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 5 days, with coadministration of a single oral dose of warfarin (25 mg) on the 5th day, had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug and did not significantly alter the INR (International Normalized Ratio). Simvastatin In 20 healthy adult subjects on a stable daily dose of simvastatin 40 mg, administration of daptomycin 4 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 14 days (N=10) had no effect on plasma trough concentrations of simvastatin and was not associated with a higher incidence of adverse events, including skeletal myopathy, than in subjects receiving placebo once daily (N=10) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid (500 mg 4 times daily) and a single dose of daptomycin 4 mg/kg by IV infusion over a 30-minute period in adults did not significantly alter the C max or AUC 0-\u221e of daptomycin. 12.4 Microbiology Daptomycin belongs to the cyclic lipopeptide class of antibacterials. Daptomycin has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of daptomycin encompasses most clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro. This has been demonstrated both by time-kill curves and by MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. Daptomycin maintained bactericidal activity in vitro against stationary phase S. aureus in simulated endocardial vegetations. The clinical significance of this is not known. Mechanism of Action Daptomycin binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death. Resistance The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is not fully understood. Currently, there are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to daptomycin. Interactions with Other Antibacterials In vitro studies have investigated daptomycin interactions with other antibacterials. Antagonism, as determined by kill curve studies, has not been observed. In vitro synergistic interactions of daptomycin with aminoglycosides, \u03b2-lactam antibacterials, and rifampin have been shown against some isolates of staphylococci (including some methicillin-resistant isolates) and enterococci (including some vancomycin-resistant isolates). Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI in adult patients. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received daptomycin at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial. S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis and Other Post-Approval Trials in Adults In subsequent clinical trials in adult patients, non-susceptible isolates were recovered. S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a compassionate-use trial and from 7 patients in the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . An E. faecium was isolated from a patient in a vancomycin-resistant enterococci trial. Antimicrobial Activity Daptomycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )]. Gram-Positive Bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant isolates) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis Streptococcus pyogenes The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for daptomycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of daptomycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

The magnetic moment alters the relaxation rates of water protons in its vicinity in the body, leading to an increase in signal intensity (brightness) of tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with: differences in proton density differences of the spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation times (T 1 ) differences in the spin-spin or transverse relaxation time (T 2 ). When placed in a magnetic field (patient in MRI machine), gadopiclenol shortens the T 1 and T 2 relaxation times in targeted tissues. The extent to which a contrast agent can affect the relaxation rate of tissue water (1/T 1 or 1/T 2 ) is termed relaxivity (r 1 or r 2 ). The relaxivity of GBCAs is presented in Table 3 . Table 3.

At the recommended dose, the mean (CV%) C max and AUC inf were 525 (13%) \u00b5g/mL and 569 (18%) \u00b5g\u00b7h/mL, respectively. Distribution After intravenous administration of Vueway, gadopiclenol is distributed in the extracellular fluids. The mean (CV%) volume of distribution of gadopiclenol at steady state is 13 (13%) L. Protein binding of gadopiclenol is \u2264 1.8% at clinically relevant concentrations. Following GBCA administration, gadolinium is present for months or years in brain, bone, skin, and other organs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . It is unknown whether the recommended dose of Vueway results in similar or different levels of gadolinium retention relative to those of other approved macrocyclic GBCAs at their recommended doses. Elimination The mean (CV%) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of gadopiclenol is 1.5 (14%) hour. The mean (CV%) total body clearance (CL) and renal clearance (CLr) of gadopiclenol are 100 (9.5%) mL/min and 81 (35%) mL/min, respectively. Metabolism Gadopiclenol is not metabolized.

Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY IN ADULTS GI Effects Famotidine is a competitive inhibitor of histamine H 2 -receptors. The primary clinically important pharmacologic activity of famotidine is inhibition of gastric secretion. Both the acid concentration and volume of gastric secretion are suppressed by famotidine, while changes in pepsin secretion are proportional to volume output. In normal volunteers and hypersecretors, famotidine inhibited basal and nocturnal gastric secretion, as well as secretion stimulated by food and pentagastrin. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurred within one hour; the maximum effect was dose-dependent, occurring within one to three hours. Duration of inhibition of secretion by doses of 20 and 40 mg was 10 to 12 hours. After intravenous administration, the maximum effect was achieved within 30 minutes. Single intravenous doses of 10 and 20 mg inhibited nocturnal secretion for a period of 10 to 12 hours. The 20 mg dose was associated with the longest duration of action in most subjects. Single evening oral doses of 20 and 40 mg inhibited basal and nocturnal acid secretion in all subjects; mean nocturnal gastric acid secretion was inhibited by 86% and 94%, respectively, for a period of at least 10 hours. The same doses given in the morning suppressed food-stimulated acid secretion in all subjects. The mean suppression was 76% and 84%, respectively, 3 to 5 hours after administration, and 25% and 30%, respectively, 8 to 10 hours after administration. In some subjects who received the 20 mg dose, however, the antisecretory effect was dissipated within 6 to 8 hours. There was no cumulative effect with repeated doses. The nocturnal intragastric pH was raised by evening doses of 20 and 40 mg of famotidine to mean values of 5.0 and 6.4, respectively. When famotidine was given after breakfast, the basal daytime interdigestive pH at 3 and 8 hours after 20 or 40 mg of famotidine was raised to about 5. Famotidine had little or no effect on fasting or postprandial serum gastrin levels. Gastric emptying and exocrine pancreatic function were not affected by famotidine. Other Effects Systemic effects of famotidine in the CNS, cardiovascular, respiratory or endocrine systems were not noted in clinical pharmacology studies. Also, no antiandrogenic effects were noted. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Serum hormone levels, including prolactin, cortisol, thyroxine (T 4 ), and testosterone, were not altered after treatment with famotidine. Pharmacokinetics Orally administered famotidine is incompletely absorbed and its bioavailability is 40 to 45%. Famotidine undergoes minimal first-pass metabolism. After oral doses, peak plasma levels occur in 1 to 3 hours. Plasma levels after multiple doses are similar to those after single doses. Fifteen to 20% of famotidine in plasma is protein bound. Famotidine has an elimination half-life of 2.5 to 3.5 hours. Famotidine is eliminated by renal (65 to 70%) and metabolic (30 to 35%) routes. Renal clearance is 250 to 450 mL/min, indicating some tubular excretion. Twenty-five to 30% of an oral dose and 65 to 70% of an intravenous dose are recovered in the urine as unchanged compound. The only metabolite identified in man is the S-oxide. There is a close relationship between creatinine clearance values and the elimination half-life of famotidine. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, i.e., creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min, the elimination half-life of famotidine may exceed 20 hours and adjustment of dose or dosing intervals in moderate and severe renal insufficiency may be necessary (see PRECAUTIONS , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In elderly patients, there are no clinically significant age-related changes in the pharmacokinetics of famotidine. However, in elderly patients with decreased renal function, the clearance of the drug may be decreased (see PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use ). Clinical Studies The majority of clinical study experience involved oral administration of famotidine tablets, and is provided herein for reference. Duodenal Ulcer In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind study in outpatients with endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcer, orally administered famotidine was compared to placebo. As shown in Table 1, 70% of patients treated with famotidine 40 mg h.s. were healed by week 4. Table 1: Outpatients with Endoscopically Confirmed Healed Duodenal Ulcers * Statistically significantly different than placebo (p<0.001) Famotidine 40 mg h.s. (N=89) Famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. (N=84) Placebo h.s. (N=97) Week 2 * 32% * 38% 17% Week 4 * 70% * 67% 31% Patients not healed by week 4 were continued in the study. By week 8, 83% of patients treated with famotidine had healed versus 45% of patients treated with placebo. The incidence of ulcer healing with famotidine was significantly higher than with placebo at each time point based on proportion of endoscopically confirmed healed ulcers. In this study, time to relief of daytime and nocturnal pain was significantly shorter for patients receiving famotidine than for patients receiving placebo; patients receiving famotidine also took less antacid than the patients receiving placebo. Long-Term Maintenance Treatment of Duodenal Ulcers Famotidine, 20 mg p.o. h.s. was compared to placebo h.s. as maintenance therapy in two double-blind, multicenter studies of patients with endoscopically confirmed healed duodenal ulcers. In the U.S. study the observed ulcer incidence within 12 months in patients treated with placebo was 2.4 times greater than in the patients treated with famotidine. The 89 patients treated with famotidine had a cumulative observed ulcer incidence of 23.4% compared to an observed ulcer incidence of 56.6% in the 89 patients receiving placebo (p<0.01). These results were confirmed in an international study where the cumulative observed ulcer incidence within 12 months in the 307 patients treated with famotidine was 35.7%, compared to an incidence of 75.5% in the 325 patients treated with placebo (p<0.01). Gastric Ulcer In both a U.S. and an international multicenter, double-blind study in patients with endoscopically confirmed active benign gastric ulcer, orally administered famotidine, 40 mg h.s., was compared to placebo h.s. Antacids were permitted during the studies, but consumption was not significantly different between the famotidine and placebo groups. As shown in Table 2, the incidence of ulcer healing (dropouts counted as unhealed) with famotidine was statistically significantly better than placebo at weeks 6 and 8 in the U.S. study, and at weeks 4, 6 and 8 in the international study, based on the number of ulcers that healed, confirmed by endoscopy.

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Orally administered famotidine was compared to placebo in a U.S. study that enrolled patients with symptoms of GERD and without endoscopic evidence of erosion or ulceration of the esophagus. Famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. was statistically significantly superior to 40 mg h.s. and to placebo in providing a successful symptomatic outcome, defined as moderate or excellent improvement of symptoms (Table 3). Table 3: % Successful Symptomatic Outcome \u2020 p\u22640.01 vs Placebo Famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. (N=154) Famotidine 40 mg h.s. (N=149) Placebo (N=73) Week 6 82 \u2020 69 62 By two weeks of treatment, symptomatic success was observed in a greater percentage of patients taking famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. compared to placebo (p\u22640.01). Symptomatic improvement and healing of endoscopically verified erosion and ulceration were studied in two additional trials. Healing was defined as complete resolution of all erosions or ulcerations visible with endoscopy. The U.S. study comparing famotidine 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. to placebo and famotidine 20 mg p.o. b.i.d., showed a significantly greater percentage of healing for famotidine 40 mg b.i.d. at weeks 6 and 12 (Table 4).

These differences were statistically significant. In the international study, when famotidine 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. was compared to ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., a statistically significantly greater percentage of healing was observed with famotidine 40 mg b.i.d. at week 12 (Table 5). There was, however, no significant difference among treatments in symptom relief. Table 5: % Endoscopic Healing - International Study \u2021\u2021 p\u22640.05 vs Ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d.

Orally administered doses from 20 to 160 mg q 6 h maintained basal acid secretion below 10 mEq/hr; initial doses were titrated to the individual patient need and subsequent adjustments were necessary with time in some patients. Famotidine was well tolerated at these high dose levels for prolonged periods (greater than 12 months) in eight patients, and there were no cases reported of gynecomastia, increased prolactin levels, or impotence which were considered to be due to the drug.

The pharmacokinetic parameters for pediatric patients, ages >3 months to 15 years, are comparable to those obtained for adults. Bioavailability studies of 8 pediatric patients (11 to 15 years of age) showed a mean oral bioavailability of 0.5 compared to adult values of 0.42 to 0.49. Oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg achieved AUCs of 645 \u00b1 249 ng-hr/mL and 580 \u00b1 60 ng-hr/mL in pediatric patients <1 year of age (N=5) and in pediatric patients 11 to 15 years of age, respectively, compared to 482 \u00b1 181 ng-hr/mL in adults treated with 40 mg orally. Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of famotidine were evaluated in 5 pediatric patients 2 to 13 years of age using the sigmoid E max model. These data suggest that the relationship between serum concentration of famotidine and gastric acid suppression is similar to that observed in one study of adults (Table 7).

Fatty acids serve as an important substrate for energy production. The most common mechanism of action for energy production derived from fatty acid metabolism is beta oxidation. Fatty acids are important for membrane structure and function, precursors for bioactive molecules (such as prostaglandins), and as regulators of gene expression. Nutrilipid 20% causes an increase in heat production, decrease in respiratory quotient, and increase in oxygen consumption following its administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The infused lipid particles are removed from the bloodstream in a manner generally thought to be similar to the enzymatic clearance of naturally produced chylomicrons formed after enteral fat intake. Following infusion, there is a transient increase in plasma triglycerides. The triglycerides are hydrolyzed to free fatty acids and glycerol by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase. The free fatty acids either enter the tissues (where they may be oxidized or resynthesized into triglycerides and stored) or circulate in the plasma, bound to albumin. In the liver, circulating free fatty acids are oxidized or converted to very low-density lipoproteins that re-enter the bloodstream. Phosphatides are the hydrophobic components of membranes and provide electrically insulated layers. They are involved in the formation of membrane structures.

However, penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain occurs only when the meninges are inflamed. Ampicillin is excreted largely unchanged in the urine and its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid. Due to maturational changes in renal function, ampicillin half-life decreases as postmenstrual age (a sum of gestational age and postnatal age) increases for infants with postnatal age of less than 28 days. The active form appears in the bile in higher concentrations than those found in serum. Ampicillin is the least serum-bound of all the penicillins, averaging about 20% compared to approximately 60 to 90% for other penicillins. Ampicillin for Injection, USP is well tolerated by most patients and has been given in doses of 2 grams daily for many weeks without adverse reactions.

Steady-state trough concentrations were achieved by the third daily dose. The mean (SD) steady-state trough concentrations attained following the administration of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg every 24h were 5.9 (1.6), 6.7 (1.6), 10.3 (5.5), 12.9 (2.9), and 13.7 (5.2) mcg/mL, respectively. Daptomycin for Injection Administered over a 2-Minute Period in Adults Following IV administration of daptomycin for injection over a 2-minute period to healthy adult volunteers at doses of 4 mg/kg (N=8) and 6 mg/kg (N=12), the mean (SD) steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) values were 475 (71) and 701 (82) mcg\u2219h/mL, respectively. Values for maximum plasma concentration (C max ) at the end of the 2-minute period could not be determined adequately in this study. However, using pharmacokinetic parameters from 14 healthy adult volunteers who received a single-dose of daptomycin for injection 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 30-minute period in a separate study, steady-state C max values were simulated for daptomycin for injection 4 and 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 2-minute period. The simulated mean (SD) steady-state C max values were 77.7 (8.1) and 116.6 (12.2) mcg/mL, respectively. Distribution Daptomycin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin, in a concentration-independent manner. The overall mean binding ranges from 90 to 93%. In clinical studies, mean serum protein binding in adult subjects with creatinine clearance (CL CR ) \u226530 mL/min was comparable to that observed in healthy adult subjects with normal renal function. However, there was a trend toward decreasing serum protein binding among subjects with CL CR <30 mL/min (88%), including those receiving hemodialysis (86%) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (84%). The protein binding of daptomycin in adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was similar to that in healthy adult subjects. The volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) of daptomycin in healthy adult subjects was approximately 0.1 L/kg and was independent of dose. Metabolism In in vitro studies, daptomycin was not metabolized by human liver microsomes. In 5 healthy adults after infusion of radiolabeled 14 C-daptomycin, the plasma total radioactivity was similar to the concentration determined by microbiological assay. Inactive metabolites were detected in urine, as determined by the difference between total radioactive concentrations and microbiologically active concentrations. In a separate study, no metabolites were observed in plasma on Day 1 following the administration of daptomycin for injection at 6 mg/kg to adult subjects. Minor amounts of three oxidative metabolites and one unidentified compound were detected in urine. The site of metabolism has not been identified. Excretion Daptomycin is excreted primarily by the kidneys. In a mass balance study of 5 healthy adult subjects using radiolabeled daptomycin, approximately 78% of the administered dose was recovered from urine based on total radioactivity (approximately 52% of the dose based on microbiologically active concentrations), and 5.7% of the administered dose was recovered from feces (collected for up to 9 days) based on total radioactivity. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Population-derived pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for infected adult patients (complicated skin and skin structure infections [cSSSI] and S. aureus bacteremia) and noninfected adult subjects with various degrees of renal function (Table 8). Total plasma clearance (CL T ), elimination half-life (t 1/2 ), and volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) in patients with cSSSI were similar to those in patients with S. aureus bacteremia. Following administration of daptomycin for injection 4 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean CL T was 9%, 22%, and 46% lower among subjects and patients with mild (CL CR 50\u201380 mL/min), moderate (CL CR 30\u2013<50 mL/min), and severe (CL CR <30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, than in those with normal renal function (CL CR >80 mL/min). The mean steady-state systemic exposure (AUC), t 1/2 , and V ss increased with decreasing renal function, although the mean AUC for patients with CL CR 30\u201380 mL/min was not markedly different from the mean AUC for patients with normal renal function. The mean AUC for patients with CL CR <30 mL/min and for patients on dialysis (CAPD and hemodialysis dosed post-dialysis) was approximately 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, than for patients with normal renal function. The mean C max ranged from 60 to 70 mcg/mL in patients with CL CR \u226530 mL/min, while the mean C max for patients with CL CR <30 mL/min ranged from 41 to 58 mcg/mL. After administration of daptomycin for injection 6 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean C max ranged from 80 to 114 mcg/mL in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and was similar to that of patients with normal renal function.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 10 adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and compared with those in healthy adult volunteers (N=9) matched for gender, age, and weight. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were not altered in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is warranted when daptomycin for injection is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been evaluated. Gender No clinically significant gender-related differences in daptomycin pharmacokinetics have been observed. No dosage adjustment is warranted based on gender when daptomycin for injection is administered. Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 12 healthy elderly subjects (\u226575 years of age) and 11 healthy young adult controls (18 to 30 years of age). Following administration of a single 4 mg/kg dose of daptomycin for injection by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean total clearance of daptomycin was approximately 35% lower and the mean AUC 0\u2013\u221e was approximately 58% higher in elderly subjects than in healthy young adult subjects. There were no differences in C max [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Obese Patients The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 6 moderately obese (Body Mass Index [BMI] 25 to 39.9 kg/m 2 ) and 6 extremely obese (BMI \u226540 kg/m 2 ) adult subjects and controls matched for age, gender, and renal function. Following administration of daptomycin for injection by IV infusion over a 30-minute period as a single 4 mg/kg dose based on total body weight, the total plasma clearance of daptomycin normalized to total body weight was approximately 15% lower in moderately obese subjects and 23% lower in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The AUC 0\u2013\u221e of daptomycin was approximately 30% higher in moderately obese subjects and 31% higher in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The differences were most likely due to differences in the renal clearance of daptomycin. No adjustment of Daptomycin for Injection dosage is warranted in obese patients. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies In vitro studies with human hepatocytes indicate that daptomycin does not inhibit or induce the activities of the following human cytochrome P450 isoforms: 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. It is unlikely that daptomycin will inhibit or induce the metabolism of drugs metabolized by the P450 system. Aztreonam In a study in which 15 healthy adult subjects received a single dose of daptomycin for injection 6 mg/kg IV and a combination dose of daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV and aztreonam 1 g IV, administered over a 30-minute period, the C max and AUC 0\u2013\u221e of daptomycin were not significantly altered by aztreonam. Tobramycin In a study in which 6 healthy adult males received a single dose of daptomycin for injection 2 mg/kg IV, tobramycin 1 mg/kg IV, and both in combination, administered over a 30-minute period, the mean C max and AUC 0\u2013\u221e of daptomycin were 12.7% and 8.7% higher, respectively, when daptomycin for injection was co-administered with tobramycin. The mean C max and AUC 0\u2013\u221e of tobramycin were 10.7% and 6.6% lower, respectively, when tobramycin was co-administered with daptomycin for injection. These differences were not statistically significant. The interaction between daptomycin and tobramycin with a clinical dose of daptomycin for injection is unknown. Warfarin In 16 healthy adult subjects, administration of daptomycin for injection 6 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 5 days, with co-administration of a single oral dose of warfarin (25 mg) on the 5 th day, had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug and did not significantly alter the INR (International Normalized Ratio). Simvastatin In 20 healthy adult subjects on a stable daily dose of simvastatin 40 mg, administration of daptomycin for injection 4 mg/kg every 24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for 14 days (N=10) had no effect on plasma trough concentrations of simvastatin and was not associated with a higher incidence of adverse events, including skeletal myopathy, than in subjects receiving placebo once daily (N=10) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid (500 mg 4 times daily) and a single dose of daptomycin for injection 4 mg/kg by IV infusion over a 30-minute period in adults did not significantly alter the C max or AUC 0\u2013\u221e of daptomycin. 12.4 Microbiology Daptomycin belongs to the cyclic lipopeptide class of antibacterials. Daptomycin has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of daptomycin encompasses most clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro . This has been demonstrated both by time-kill curves and by MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. Daptomycin maintained bactericidal activity in vitro against stationary phase S. aureus in simulated endocardial vegetations. The clinical significance of this is not known. Mechanism of Action Daptomycin binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death. Resistance The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is not fully understood. Currently, there are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to daptomycin. Interactions with Other Antibacterials In vitro studies have investigated daptomycin interactions with other antibacterials. Antagonism, as determined by kill curve studies, has not been observed. In vitro synergistic interactions of daptomycin with aminoglycosides, \u03b2-lactam antibacterials, and rifampin have been shown against some isolates of staphylococci (including some methicillin-resistant isolates) and enterococci (including some vancomycin-resistant isolates). Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI in adult patients. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received daptomycin for injection at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial. S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis and Other Post-Approval Trials in Adults In subsequent clinical trials in adult patients, non-susceptible isolates were recovered. S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a compassionate-use trial and from 7 patients in the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. An E. faecium was isolated from a patient in a vancomycin-resistant enterococci trial. Antimicrobial Activity Daptomycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Gram-Positive Bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant isolates) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis Streptococcus pyogenes The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for daptomycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of daptomycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Slow I.V. administration of 500 mg gives a peak serum level of 43 mcg/mL after 5 minutes with a half-life of 20 to 30 minutes. Oxacillin sodium, with normal doses, has insignificant concentrations in the cerebrospinal and ascitic fluids. It is found in therapeutic concentrations in the pleural, bile, and amniotic fluids. Oxacillin sodium is rapidly excreted as unchanged drug in the urine by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. The elimination half-life for oxacillin is about 0.5 hours. Nonrenal elimination includes hepatic inactivation and excretion in bile. Oxacillin sodium binds to serum protein, mainly albumin. The degree of protein binding reported varies with the method of study and the investigator, but generally has been found to be 94.2 \u00b1 2.1%. Probenecid blocks the renal tubular secretion of penicillins. Therefore, the concurrent administration of probenecid prolongs the elimination of oxacillin and, consequently, increases the serum concentration. Intramuscular injections give peak serum levels 30 minutes after injection. A 250 mg dose gives a level of 5.3 mcg/mL while a 500 mg dose peaks at 10.9 mcg/mL. Intravenous injection gives a peak about 5 minutes after the injection is completed. Slow IV dosing with 500 mg gives a 5 minute peak of 43 mcg/mL with a half-life of 20 to 30 minutes. Microbiology Mode of Action Penicillinase-resistant penicillins exert a bactericidal action against penicillin susceptible microorganisms during the state of active multiplication. All penicillins inhibit the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Mechanism of Resistance Resistance to penicillins may be mediated by destruction of the beta-lactam ring by a beta-lactamase, altered affinity of penicillin for target, or decreased penetration of the antibiotic to reach the target site. Cross Resistance Resistance to oxacillin (or cefoxitin) implies resistance to all other beta-lactam agents, except newer agents with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported through the cell membrane by facilitative glucose transporter proteins and is phosphorylated within the cell to [18F] FDG-6-phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase. Once phosphorylated it cannot exit until it is dephosphorylated by glucose-6-phosphatase. Therefore, within a given tissue or pathophysiological process, the retention and clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect a balance involving glucose transporter, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is used to assess glucose metabolism. In comparison to background activity of the specific organ or tissue type, regions of decreased or absent uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect the decrease or absence of glucose metabolism. Regions of increased uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect greater than normal rates of glucose metabolism. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection USP is rapidly distributed to all organs of the body after intravenous administration. After background clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection USP, optimal PET imaging is generally achieved between 30 to 40 minutes after administration. In cancer, the cells are generally characterized by enhanced glucose metabolism partially due to (1) an increase in activity of glucose transporters, (2) an increased rate of phosphorylation activity, (3) a reduction of phosphatase activity or, (4) a dynamic alteration in the balance among all these processes. However, glucose metabolism of cancer as reflected by Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation shows considerable variability. Depending on tumor type, stage, and location, Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation may be increased, normal, or decreased. Also, inflammatory cells can have the same variability of uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18. In the heart, under normal aerobic conditions, the myocardium meets the bulk of its energy requirements by oxidizing free fatty acids. Most of the exogenous glucose taken up by the myocyte is converted into glycogen. However, under ischemic conditions, the oxidation of free fatty acids decreases, exogenous glucose becomes the preferred myocardial substrate, glycolysis is stimulated, and glucose taken up by the myocyte is metabolized immediately instead of being converted into glycogen. Under these conditions, phosphorylated Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulates in the myocyte and can be detected with PET imaging. In the brain, cells normally rely on aerobic metabolism. In epilepsy, the glucose metabolism varies. Generally, during a seizure, glucose metabolism increases. Interictally, the seizure focus tends to be hypometabolic. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution: In four healthy male volunteers, receiving an intravenous administration of 30 seconds in duration, the arterial blood level profile for Fludeoxyglucose F 18 decayed triexponentially. The effective half-life ranges of the three phases were 0.2-0.3 minutes, 10-13 minutes with a mean and standard deviation (STD) of 12 (\u00b1) 1 min, and 80-95 minutes with a mean and STD of 88 (\u00b1) 4 min.

Inactive Ingredients: 4950 mg of mannitol, USP; and 30 mg of sodium citrate, USP. Zoledronic Acid Structural Formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zoledronic acid is a bisphosphonate and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously administered zoledronic acid rapidly partitions to bone and localizes preferentially at sites of high bone turnover. The main molecular target of zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. The relatively long duration of action of zoledronic acid is attributable to its high binding affinity to bone mineral. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic data in patients with Paget\u2019s disease of bone are not available. Distribution Single or multiple (every 28 days) 5-minute or 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 or 16 mg zoledronic acid were given to 64 patients with cancer and bone metastases. The post-infusion decline of zoledronic acid concentrations in plasma was consistent with a triphasic process showing a rapid decrease from peak concentrations at end-of-infusion to less than 1% of Cmax 24 hours post infusion with population half-lives of t1/2\u03b1 0.24 hour and t1/2\u03b2 1.87 hours for the early disposition phases of the drug. The terminal elimination phase of zoledronic acid was prolonged, with very low concentrations in plasma between Days 2 and 28 post infusion, and a terminal elimination half-life t1/2\u03b3 of 146 hours. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC0-24h) of zoledronic acid was dose proportional from 2 to 16 mg. The accumulation of zoledronic acid measured over three cycles was low, with mean AUC0-24h ratios for cycles 2 and 3 versus 1 of 1.13 \u00b1 0.30 and 1.16 \u00b1 0.36, respectively. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed low affinity of zoledronic acid for the cellular components of human blood. In vitro mean zoledronic acid protein binding in human plasma ranged from 28% at 200 ng/mL to 53% at 50 ng/mL. Metabolism Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro . Zoledronic acid does not undergo biotransformation in vivo . In animal studies, less than 3% of the administered intravenous dose was found in the feces, with the balance either recovered in the urine or taken up by bone, indicating that the drug is eliminated intact via the kidney. Following an intravenous dose of 20 nCi 14C-zoledronic acid in a patient with cancer and bone metastases, only a single radioactive species with chromatographic properties identical to those of parent drug was recovered in urine, which suggests that zoledronic acid is not metabolized. Excretion In 64 patients with cancer and bone metastases on average (\u00b1 SD) 39 \u00b1 16% of the administered zoledronic acid dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours, with only trace amounts of drug found in urine post Day 2. The cumulative percent of drug excreted in the urine over 0 to 24 hours was independent of dose. The balance of drug not recovered in urine over 0 to 24 hours, representing drug presumably bound to bone, is slowly released back into the systemic circulation, giving rise to the observed prolonged low plasma concentrations. The 0 to 24 hour renal clearance of zoledronic acid was 3.7 \u00b1 2.0 L/h. Zoledronic acid clearance was independent of dose but dependent upon the patient\u2019s creatinine clearance. In a study in patients with cancer and bone metastases, increasing the infusion time of a 4 mg dose of zoledronic acid from 5 minutes (n = 5) to 15 minutes (n = 7) resulted in a 34% decrease in the zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion ([mean \u00b1 SD] 403 \u00b1 118 ng/mL vs. 264 \u00b1 86 ng/mL) and a 10% increase in the total AUC (378 \u00b1 116 ng x h/mL vs. 420 \u00b1 218 ng x h/mL). The difference between the AUC means was not statistically significant. Specific Populations Pediatrics Zoledronic acid is not indicated for use in children [see Pediatric Use (8.4) ] . Geriatrics The pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid was not affected by age in patients with cancer and bone metastases whose age ranged from 38 years to 84 years. Race The pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid was not affected by race in patients with cancer and bone metastases. Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetic studies conducted in 64 cancer patients represented typical clinical populations with normal to moderately-impaired renal function. Compared to patients with creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/min (N = 37), patients with creatinine clearance = 50 to 80 mL/min (N = 15) showed an average increase in plasma AUC of 15%, whereas patients with creatinine clearance = 30 to 50 mL/min (N = 11) showed an average increase in plasma AUC of 43%. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with a creatinine clearance of greater than or equal to 35 mL/min.

Perioperative Prophylaxis: The prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection preoperatively, intraoperatively and postoperatively may reduce the incidence of certain postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures which are classified as contaminated or potentially contaminated (e.g., vaginal hysterectomy, and cholecystectomy in high-risk patients such as those older than 70 years, with acute cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, or common duct bile stones). The perioperative use of Cefazolin for Injection may also be effective in surgical patients in whom infection at the operative site would present a serious risk (e.g., during open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty). The prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection should usually be discontinued within a 24 hour period after the surgical procedure. In surgery where the occurrence of infection may be particularly devastating (e.g., open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty), the prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection may be continued for 3 to 5 days following the completion of surgery. If there are signs of infection, specimens for cultures should be obtained for the identification of the causative organism so that appropriate therapy may be instituted (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Cefazolin for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

Studies have shown that following intravenous administration of Cefazolin for Injection to normal volunteers, mean serum concentrations peaked at approximately 185 mcg/mL and were approximately 4 mcg/mL at 8 hours for a 1 gram dose. The serum half-life for Cefazolin for Injection is approximately 1.8 hours following IV administration and approximately 2 hours following IM administration. In a study (using normal volunteers) of constant intravenous infusion with dosages of 3.5 mg/kg for 1 hour (approximately 250 mg) and 1.5 mg/kg the next 2 hours (approximately 100 mg), Cefazolin for Injection produced a steady serum level at the third hour of approximately 28 mcg/mL. Studies in patients hospitalized with infections indicate that Cefazolin for Injection produces mean peak serum levels approximately equivalent to those seen in normal volunteers. Bile levels in patients without obstructive biliary disease can reach or exceed serum levels by up to five times; however, in patients with obstructive biliary disease, bile levels of Cefazolin for Injection are considerably lower than serum levels (< 1 mcg/mL). In synovial fluid, the level of Cefazolin for Injection becomes comparable to that reached in serum at about 4 hours after drug administration. Studies of cord blood show prompt transfer of Cefazolin for Injection across the placenta. Cefazolin for Injection is present in very low concentrations in the milk of nursing mothers. Cefazolin for Injection is excreted unchanged in the urine. In the first 6 hours approximately 60% of the drug is excreted in the urine and this increases to 70% to 80% within 24 hours. Cefazolin for Injection achieves peak urine concentrations of approximately 2,400 mcg/mL and 4,000 mcg/mL respectively following 500 mg and 1 gram intramuscular doses.

The maximum plasma concentration (C max ) of edaravone was reached by the end of infusion. There was a trend of more than dose-proportional increase in area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and Cmax of edaravone. With multiple-dose administration, edaravone does not accumulate in plasma. Distribution Edaravone is bound to human serum proteins (92%), mainly to albumin, with no concentration dependence in the range of 0.1 to 50 micromol/L. Edaravone has a mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of 63.1 L. Elimination The mean terminal elimination half-life of edaravone is approximately 4.5 to 9 hours. The half-lives of its metabolites are 3 to 6 hours. Following intravenous administration, the total clearance of edaravone is estimated to be 35.9 L/h. Metabolism Edaravone is metabolized to a sulfate conjugate and a glucuronide conjugate, which are not pharmacologically active. The glucuronide conjugation of edaravone involves multiple uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms (UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT1A10, UGT2B7, and UGT2B17). In human plasma, edaravone is mainly detected as the sulfate conjugate, which is presumed to be formed by sulfotransferases. Excretion In Japanese and Caucasian healthy volunteer studies, edaravone was excreted mainly in the urine as its glucuronide conjugate (60-80% of the dose up to 48 hours). Approximately 6-8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as the sulfate conjugate, and < 1% of the dose was recovered in the urine as the unchanged drug. In vitro studies suggest that the sulfate conjugate of edaravone is hydrolyzed back to edaravone, which is then converted to the glucuronide conjugate in the kidney before excretion into the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No age effect on edaravone pharmacokinetics has been found [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment Following single IV infusion of 30 mg edaravone (half the recommended dosage of edaravone injection) over 60 minutes, mean C max and AUC 0- \u221e of unchanged edaravone were 1.15 and 1.20-fold greater in the subjects with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), and were 1.25 and 1.29-fold greater in the subjects with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) when compared to subjects with normal renal function, respectively. These changes in exposures are not considered to be clinically significant and therefore no dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effects of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of edaravone have not been studied. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following single IV infusion of 30 mg edaravone (half of the recommended dose of edaravone injection) over 60 minutes, mean C max and AUC 0- \u221e of unchanged edaravone were 1.20 and 1.07-fold greater in the subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 or 6), were 1.24 and 1.14-fold greater in the subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), and were 1.20 and 1.19-fold greater in the subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 10 to 14) when compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, respectively. These changes in exposures are not considered to be clinically significant and therefore no dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment. Male and Female Patients No gender effect on edaravone pharmacokinetics has been found. Racial or Ethnic Groups There were no significant racial differences in C max and AUC of edaravone between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Drug Interaction Studies The pharmacokinetics of edaravone is not expected to be significantly affected by inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, UGTs, or major transporters. In vitro studies demonstrated that, at the recommended dosage, edaravone and its metabolites are not expected to significantly inhibit CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A), conjugating enzymes UGT1A1 and UGT2B7, or other transporters (P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K) in humans.

Bone and Joint Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase- and non\u2013penicillinase-producing strains). Clinical microbiological studies in skin and skin\u00ad-structure infections frequently reveal the growth of susceptible strains of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Cefuroxime for Injection has been used successfully in these mixed infections in which several organisms have been isolated. In certain cases of confirmed or suspected gram-positive or gram-negative sepsis or in patients with other serious infections in which the causative organism has not been identified, Cefuroxime for Injection may be used concomitantly with an aminoglycoside (see PRECAUTIONS ). The recommended doses of both antibiotics may be given depending on the severity of the infection and the patient's condition. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefuroxime for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Cefuroxime for Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Prevention: The preoperative prophylactic administration of Cefuroxime for Injection may prevent the growth of susceptible disease-causing bacteria and thereby may reduce the incidence of certain postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures (e.g., vaginal hysterectomy) that are classified as clean-contaminated or potentially contaminated procedures. Effective prophylactic use of antibiotics in surgery depends on the time of administration. Cefuroxime for Injection should usually be given one-half to 1 hour before the operation to allow sufficient time to achieve effective antibiotic concentrations in the wound tissues during the procedure. The dose should be repeated intraoperatively if the surgical procedure is lengthy. Prophylactic administration is usually not required after the surgical procedure ends and should be stopped within 24 hours. In the majority of surgical procedures, continuing prophylactic administration of any antibiotic does not reduce the incidence of subsequent infections but will increase the possibility of adverse reactions and the development of bacterial resistance. The perioperative use of Cefuroxime for Injection has also been effective during open heart surgery for surgical patients in whom infections at the operative site would present a serious risk. For these patients it is recommended that therapy with Cefuroxime for Injection be continued for at least 48 hours after the surgical procedure ends.

Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK 1 ) receptors. Aprepitant has little or no affinity for serotonin (5-HT 3 ), dopamine, and corticosteroid receptors, the targets of existing therapies for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Aprepitant has been shown in animal models to inhibit emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, via central actions. Animal and human Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies with aprepitant have shown that it crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK 1 receptors. Animal and human studies have shown that aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5-HT 3 -receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin-induced emesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled, thorough QTc study, a single 200 mg dose of fosaprepitant (approximately 1.3 times the recommended dose) had no effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Aprepitant after Fosaprepitant Administration Following administration of a single intravenous 150 mg dose of fosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant administered as a 20-minute infusion to healthy subjects, the mean AUC 0-\u221e of aprepitant was 37.4 (\u00b1 14.8) mcg\u2022hr/mL and the mean maximal aprepitant concentration (C max ) was 4.2 (\u00b1 1.2) mcg/mL. Plasma concentrations of fosaprepitant are below the limits of quantification (10 ng/mL) within 30 minutes of the completion of infusion. Distribution Aprepitant is greater than 95% bound to plasma proteins. The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vd ss ) was approximately 70 L in humans. Aprepitant crosses the blood brain barrier in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Elimination Metabolism Fosaprepitant is converted to aprepitant in in vitro incubations with human liver preparations and in S9 preparations from multiple other human tissues including kidney, lung and ileum. Thus, it appears that the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant can occur in multiple extrahepatic tissues in addition to the liver. Aprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Metabolism is largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side chains. No metabolism by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, or CYP2E1 was detected. In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for approximately 24% of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single oral 300 mg dose of [ 14 C]-aprepitant, indicating a substantial presence of metabolites in the plasma. Seven metabolites of aprepitant, which are only weakly active, have been identified in human plasma. Excretion Following administration of a single intravenous 100 mg dose of [ 14 C]-fosaprepitant to healthy subjects, 57% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 45% in feces. Aprepitant is eliminated primarily by metabolism; aprepitant is not renally excreted. The apparent terminal half-life ranged from approximately 9 to 13 hours. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 through 5, the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 21% higher on Day 1 and 36% higher on Day 5 in elderly (65 years and older) relative to younger adults. The C max was 10% higher on Day 1 and 24% higher on Day 5 in elderly relative to younger adults. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Sex Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant, ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg, the AUC 0-24hr and C max are 9% and 17% higher in females as compared with males. The half-life of aprepitant is approximately 25% lower in females as compared with males and T max occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. Race/Ethnicity Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant, ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg, the AUC 0-24hr and C max are approximately 27% and 19% higher in Hispanics as compared with Caucasians. The AUC 0-24hr and C max were 74% and 47% higher in Asians as compared to Caucasians. There was no difference in AUC 0-24hr or C max between Caucasians and Blacks. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. Renal Impairment A single 240 mg oral dose of aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis. In patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC 0-\u221e of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound) decreased by 21% and C max decreased by 32%, relative to healthy subjects (creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault method). In patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis, the AUC 0-\u221e of total aprepitant decreased by 42% and C max decreased by 32%. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the AUC of pharmacologically active unbound drug was not significantly affected in patients with renal impairment compared with healthy subjects. Hemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2% of the dose was recovered in the dialysate. Hepatic Impairment Fosaprepitant is metabolized in various extrahepatic tissues; therefore hepatic impairment is not expected to alter the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant. Following administration of a single 125 mg oral dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3 to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6), the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 11% lower on Day 1 and 36% lower on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), the AUC 0-24hr of aprepitant was 10% higher on Day 1 and 18% higher on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. These differences in AUC 0-24hr are not considered clinically meaningful. There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Body Mass Index (BMI) For every 5 kg/m 2 increase in BMI, AUC 0-24hr and C max of aprepitant decrease by 9% and 10%. BMI of subjects in the analysis ranged from 18 kg/m 2 to 36 kg/m 2 . This change is not considered clinically meaningful. Drug Interactions Studies Fosaprepitant, given as a single 150 mg dose, is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, with no evidence of inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 observed on Day 4. The weak inhibition of CYP3A4 continues for 2 days after single dose administration of fosaprepitant. Aprepitant is a substrate, an inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9. Fosaprepitant or aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P\u00ad-glycoprotein transporter. Effects of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Midazolam: Fosaprepitant 150 mg administered as a single intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC 0-\u221e of midazolam by approximately 1.8-fold on Day 1 and had no effect on Day 4 when midazolam was coadministered as a single oral dose of 2 mg on Days 1 and 4 [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone: Fosaprepitant administered as a single 150 mg intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC 0-24hr of dexamethasone, administered as a single 8 mg oral dose on Days 1, 2, and 3, by approximately 2-fold on Days 1 and 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Methylprednisolone: When oral aprepitant as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) was administered with intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg on Day 1 and oral methylprednisolone 40 mg on Days 2 and 3, the AUC of methylprednisolone was increased by 1.34-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3 [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Chemotherapeutic agents: Docetaxel: In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant administered as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Vinorelbine: In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant administered as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine to a clinically significant degree. Oral contraceptives: When oral aprepitant was administered as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) with ondansetron and dexamethasone, and coadministered with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, the trough concentrations of both ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone were reduced by as much as 64% for 3 weeks post-treatment [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. CYP2C9 substrates (Warfarin, Tolbutamide): Warfarin: A single 125 mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to subjects who were stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy. Although there was no effect of oral aprepitant on the plasma AUC of R(+) or S(-) warfarin determined on Day 3, there was a 34% decrease in S(-) warfarin trough concentration accompanied by a 14% decrease in the prothrombin time (reported as International Normalized Ratio or INR) 5 days after completion of dosing with oral aprepitant [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Tolbutamide: Oral aprepitant, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of tolbutamide by 23% on Day 4, 28% on Day 8, and 15% on Day 15, when a single dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered prior to the administration of the 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant and on Days 4, 8, and 15. This effect was not considered clinically important. Other Drugs P-glycoprotein substrates: Aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P-\u00adglycoprotein transporter, as demonstrated by the lack of interaction of oral aprepitant with digoxin in a clinical drug interaction study. 5-HT 3 antagonists: In clinical drug interaction studies, aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron, granisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of dolasetron). Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant Rifampin: When a single 375 mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14-day regimen of 600 mg/day of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased approximately 11-fold and the mean terminal half-life decreased approximately 3-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Ketoconazole: When a single 125 mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Diltiazem: In a study in 10 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of 100 mg of fosaprepitant as an intravenous infusion with 120 mg of diltiazem, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor administered three times daily, resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the aprepitant AUC and a 1.4-fold increase in the diltiazem AUC. When fosaprepitant was administered with diltiazem, the mean maximum decrease in diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater than that observed with diltiazem alone [24.3 \u00b1 10.2 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 15.6 \u00b1 4.1 mm Hg without fosaprepitant]. The mean maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure was also greater after co-administration of diltiazem with fosaprepitant than administration of diltiazem alone [29.5 \u00b1 7.9 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 23.8 \u00b1 4.8 mm Hg without fosaprepitant]. Co-administration of fosaprepitant and diltiazem; however, did not result in any additional clinically significant changes in heart rate or PR interval, beyond those changes observed with diltiazem alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Paroxetine: Coadministration of once daily doses of oral aprepitant 170 mg, with paroxetine 20 mg once daily, resulted in a decrease in AUC by approximately 25% and C max by approximately 20% of both aprepitant and paroxetine. This effect was not considered clinically important. Pediatric use information is approved for Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.\u2019s Emend (fosaprepitant) for injection.

Studies have shown that following intravenous administration of Cefazolin for Injection to normal volunteers, mean serum concentrations peaked at approximately 185 mcg/mL and were approximately 4 mcg/mL at 8 hours for a 1\u2011gram dose. The serum half\u2011life for Cefazolin for Injection is approximately 1.8 hours following I.V. administration. In a study (using normal volunteers) of constant intravenous infusion with dosages of 3.5 mg/kg for 1 hour (approximately 250 mg) and 1.5 mg/kg the next 2 hours (approximately 100 mg), Cefazolin for Injection produced a steady serum level at the third hour of approximately 28 mcg/mL.

Fluorouracil is converted to three main active metabolites: 5-fluoro-2\u2019-deoxyuridine-5\u2019-monophosphate (FdUMP), 5-fluorouridine-5\u2019-triphosphate (FUTP) and 5-fluoro-2\u2019-deoxyuridine-5\u2019-triphosphate (FdUTP). These metabolites have several effects including the inhibition of thymidylate synthase by FdUMP, incorporation of FUTP into RNA and incorporation of FdUTP into DNA. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Following bolus intravenous injection, fluorouracil distributes throughout the body including the intestinal mucosa, bone marrow, liver, cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue. Elimination Following bolus intravenous injection, 5 to 20% of the parent drug is excreted unchanged in the urine in six hours. The remaining percentage of the administered dose is metabolized, primarily in the liver. The metabolites of fluorouracil (e.g., urea and \u03b1-fluoro-\u00df-alanine) are excreted in the urine over 3 to 4 hours. Following bolus intravenous injection of fluorouracil, as a single agent, the elimination half-life increased with dose from 8 to 20 minutes. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics The DPYD gene encodes the enzyme DPD, which is responsible for the catabolism of >80% of fluorouracil. Approximately 3 to 5% of White populations have partial DPD deficiency and 0.2% of White populations have complete DPD deficiency, which may be due to certain genetic no function or decreased function variants in DPYD resulting in partial to complete or near complete absence of enzyme activity. DPD deficiency is estimated to be more prevalent in Black or African American populations compared to White populations. Insufficient information is available to estimate the prevalence of DPD deficiency in other populations. Patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for no function DPYD variants (i.e., carry two no function DPYD variants) or are compound heterozygous for a no function DPYD variant plus a decreased function DPYD variant have complete DPD deficiency and are at increased risk for acute early-onset of toxicity and serious life-threatening, or fatal adverse reactions due to increased systemic exposure to fluorouracil. Partial DPD deficiency can result from the presence of either two decreased function DPYD variants or one normal function plus either a decreased function or a no function DPYD variant. Patients with partial DPD deficiency may also be at an increased risk for toxicity from fluorouracil. Four DPYD variants have been associated with impaired DPD activity in White populations, especially when present as homozygous or compound heterozygous variants: c.1905+1G>A ( DPYD *2A), c.1679T>G ( DPYD *13), c.2846A>T, and c.1129-5923C>G (Haplotype B3).

Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework, which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release. The binding of bivalirudin to thrombin is reversible as thrombin slowly cleaves the bivalirudin-Arg 3 -Pro 4 bond, resulting in recovery of thrombin active site functions. In in vitro studies, bivalirudin inhibited both soluble (free) and clot-bound thrombin, was not neutralized by products of the platelet release reaction, and prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin time (PT) of normal human plasma in a concentration-dependent manner. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy volunteers and patients (with \u226570% vessel occlusion undergoing routine PTCA), bivalirudin exhibited dose- and concentration-dependent anticoagulant activity as evidenced by prolongation of the ACT, aPTT, PT, and TT. Intravenous administration of bivalirudin produces an immediate anticoagulant effect. Coagulation times return to baseline approximately 1 hour following cessation of bivalirudin administration. Bivalirudin also increases INR. Therefore, INR measurements made in bivalirudin treated patients may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. In 291 patients with \u226570% vessel occlusion undergoing routine PTCA, a positive correlation was observed between the dose of bivalirudin and the proportion of patients achieving ACT values of 300 sec or 350 sec. At a bivalirudin dose of 1 mg/kg IV bolus plus 2.5 mg/kg/h IV infusion for 4 hours, followed by 0.2 mg/kg/h, all patients reached maximal ACT values greater than 300 sec. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Bivalirudin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics following IV administration to patients undergoing PTCA. In these patients, a mean steady state bivalirudin concentration of 12.3 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL is achieved following an IV bolus of 1 mg/kg and a 4-hour 2.5 mg/kg/h IV infusion. Distribution Bivalirudin does not bind to plasma proteins (other than thrombin) or to red blood cells. Elimination Bivalirudin has a half-life of 25 minutes in PTCA patients with normal renal function. The total body clearance of bivalirudin in PTCA patients with normal renal function is 3.4 mL/min/kg. Metabolism Bivalirudin is metabolized by proteolytic cleavage. Excretion Bivalirudin undergoes glomerular filtration. Tubular secretion and tubular reabsorption are also implicated in the excretion of bivalirudin, although the extent is unknown.

Piperacillin plasma concentrations, following a 30-minute infusion of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection, were similar to those attained when equivalent doses of piperacillin were administered alone. Steady-state plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam were similar to those attained after the first dose due to the short half-lives of piperacillin and tazobactam. Distribution Both piperacillin and tazobactam are approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. The protein binding of either piperacillin or tazobactam is unaffected by the presence of the other compound. Protein binding of the tazobactam metabolite is negligible. Piperacillin and tazobactam are widely distributed into tissues and body fluids including intestinal mucosa, gallbladder, lung, female reproductive tissues (uterus, ovary, and fallopian tube), interstitial fluid, and bile. Mean tissue concentrations are generally 50% to 100% of those in plasma. Distribution of piperacillin and tazobactam into cerebrospinal fluid is low in subjects with non-inflamed meninges, as with other penicillins (see Table 8 ).

Tazobactam is metabolized to a single metabolite that lacks pharmacological and antibacterial activities. Excretion Following single or multiple piperacillin and tazobactam for injection doses to healthy subjects, the plasma half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 hours and was unaffected by dose or duration of infusion. Both piperacillin and tazobactam are eliminated via the kidney by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Piperacillin is excreted rapidly as unchanged drug with 68% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. Tazobactam and its metabolite are eliminated primarily by renal excretion with 80% of the administered dose excreted as unchanged drug and the remainder as the single metabolite. Piperacillin, tazobactam and desethyl piperacillin are also secreted into the bile. Specific Populations Renal Impairment After the administration of single doses of piperacillin and tazobactam to subjects with renal impairment, the half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. At creatinine clearance below 20 mL/min, the increase in half-life is twofold for piperacillin and fourfold for tazobactam compared to subjects with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments for piperacillin and tazobactam for injection are recommended when creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min in patients receiving the usual recommended daily dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection. See Dosage and Administration (2) for specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with renal impairment. Hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of a piperacillin and tazobactam dose with an additional 5% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. Peritoneal dialysis removes approximately 6% and 21% of the piperacillin and tazobactam doses, respectively, with up to 16% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. For dosage recommendations for patients undergoing hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Hepatic Impairment The half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases by approximately 25% and 18%, respectively, in patients with hepatic cirrhosis compared to healthy subjects. However, this difference does not warrant dosage adjustment of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection due to hepatic cirrhosis. Pediatrics Piperacillin and tazobactam pharmacokinetics were studied in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older. The clearance of both compounds is slower in the younger patients compared to older children and adults. In a population PK analysis, estimated clearance for 9 month-old to 12 year-old patients was comparable to adults, with a population mean (SE) value of 5.64 (0.34) mL/min/kg. The piperacillin clearance estimate is 80% of this value for pediatric patients 2 to 9 months old. In patients younger than 2 months of age, clearance of piperacillin is slower compared to older children; however, it is not adequately characterized for dosing recommendations. The population mean (SE) for piperacillin volume of distribution is 0.243 (0.011) L/kg and is independent of age. Geriatrics The impact of age on the pharmacokinetics of piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male subjects, aged 18 to 35 years (n=6) and aged 65 to 80 years (n=12). Mean half-life for piperacillin and tazobactam was 32% and 55% higher, respectively, in the elderly compared to the younger subjects. This difference may be due to age-related changes in creatinine clearance. Race The effect of race on piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male volunteers. No difference in piperacillin or tazobactam pharmacokinetics was observed between Asian (n=9) and Caucasian (n=9) healthy volunteers who received single 4/0.5 g doses. Drug Interactions The potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between piperacillin and tazobactam for injection and aminoglycosides, probenecid, vancomycin, heparin, vecuronium, and methotrexate has been evaluated [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Piperacillin sodium exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting septum formation and cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. In vitro , piperacillin is active against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Tazobactam sodium has little clinically relevant in vitro activity against bacteria due to its reduced affinity to penicillin-binding proteins. It is, however, a beta-lactamase inhibitor of the Molecular class A enzymes, including Richmond-Sykes class III (Bush class 2b & 2b\u2019) penicillinases and cephalosporinases. It varies in its ability to inhibit class II and IV (2a & 4) penicillinases. Tazobactam does not induce chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases at tazobactam concentrations achieved with the recommended dosage regimen. Antimicrobial Activity Piperacillin and tazobactam has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Aerobic bacteria Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae (excluding beta-lactamase negative, ampicillin-resistant isolates) Klebsiella pneumoniae Pseudomonas aeruginosa (given in combination with an aminoglycoside to which the isolate is susceptible) Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis group ( B. fragilis , B. ovatus , B. thetaiotaomicron , and B. vulgatus ) The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for piperacillin and tazobactam against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

The mean time to peak flow velocity was 6.5 minutes from the start of the 4-minute infusion (range 2.5 to 8.7 minutes). Cardiovascular responses to the intravenous administration of Dipyridamole Injection when given to patients in the supine position include a mild but significant increase in heart rate of approximately 20% and mild but significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure of approximately 2-8%, with vital signs returning to baseline values in approximately 30 minutes. Mechanism of Action Dipyridamole is a coronary vasodilator in man. The mechanism of vasodilation has not been fully elucidated, but may result from inhibition of uptake of adenosine, an important mediator of coronary vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole are abolished by administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline. How dipyridamole-induced vasodilation leads to abnormalities in thallium distribution and ventricular function is also uncertain but presumably represents a \u201csteal\u201d phenomenon in which relatively intact vessels dilate and sustain enhanced flow, leaving reduced pressure and flow across areas of hemodynamically important coronary vascular constriction.

By the end of short-term intravenous infusion, peak serum concentrations of active clindamycin are reached. After intramuscular injection of clindamycin phosphate, peak concentrations of active clindamycin are reached within 3 hours in adults and 1 hour in pediatric patients. Serum concentration-time curves may be constructed from IV peak serum concentrations as given in Table 1 by application of elimination half-lives (see Excretion ). Serum concentrations of clindamycin can be maintained above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations for most indicated organisms by administration of clindamycin phosphate every 8 to 12 hours in adults and every 6 to 8 hours in pediatric patients, or by continuous intravenous infusion. An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose. No significant concentrations of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid even in the presence of inflamed meninges. Metabolism In vitro studies in human liver and intestinal microsomes indicated that clindamycin is predominantly metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with minor contribution from CYP3A5, to form clindamycin sulfoxide and a minor metabolite, N\u2011desmethylclindamycin. Excretion Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears from the serum with 6 minutes of the average elimination half-life; however, the average serum elimination half-life of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2\u00bd hours in pediatric patients. Specific Populations Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules do not need to be modified in patients with renal or hepatic disease. Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61-79 years) and younger adults (18-39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, the average elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4-5.1 h) in the elderly, compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1-4.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function 1 . Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients with PMA \u2264 32 weeks, or > 32 to \u2264 40 weeks Systemic clearance (CL) in premature infants increases with increases in bodyweight (kg) and post-menstrual age (PMA).

Microbiology Mechanism of Action Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic. Resistance Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B. Macrolide-inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test. Antimicrobial Activity Clindamycin has been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ]: Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pyogenes Anaerobic bacteria Clostridium perfringens Fusobacterium necrophorum Fusobacterium nucleatum Peptostreptococcus anaerobius Prevotella melaninogenica The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

While ondansetron\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, it is not a dopamine-receptor antagonist. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In normal volunteers, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. In another trial in six normal male volunteers, a 16 mg dose infused over 5 minutes showed no effect of the drug on cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, blood pressure, or electrocardiogram (ECG). Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in normal volunteers. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations. In a gender balanced pharmacodynamic trial (n = 56), ondansetron 4 mg administered intravenously or intramuscularly was dynamically similar in the prevention of nausea and vomiting using the ipecacuanha model of emesis. Cardiac Electrophysiology QTc interval prolongation was studied in a double-blind, single intravenous dose, placebo- and positive-controlled, crossover trial in 58 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline correction was 19.5 (21.8) ms and 5.6 (7.4) ms after 15-minute intravenous infusions of 32 mg and 8 mg Ondansetron Injection, respectively. A significant exposure-response relationship was identified between ondansetron concentration and \u0394\u0394QTcF. Using the established exposure-response relationship, 24 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes had a mean predicted (95% upper prediction interval) \u0394\u0394QTcF of 14.0 (16.3) ms. In contrast, 16 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes using the same model had a mean predicted (95% upper prediction interval) \u0394\u0394QTcF of 9.1 (11.2) ms. In this study, the 8-mg dose infused over 15 minutes did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In normal adult volunteers, the following mean pharmacokinetic data have been determined following a single 0.15-mg/kg intravenous dose. Absorption A trial was performed in normal volunteers (n = 56) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single 4-mg dose administered as a 5-minute infusion compared with a single intramuscular injection. Systemic exposure as measured by mean AUC were equivalent, with values of 156 [95% CI: 136, 180] and 161 [95% CI: 137, 190] ng\u2022h/mL for intravenous and intramuscular groups, respectively. Mean peak plasma concentrations were 42.9 [95% CI: 33.8, 54.4] ng/mL at 10 minutes after intravenous infusion and 31.9 [95% CI: 26.3, 38.6] ng/mL at 41 minutes after intramuscular injection. Distribution Plasma protein binding of ondansetron as measured in vitro was 70% to 76%, over the pharmacologic concentration range of 10 to 500 ng/mL. Circulating drug also distributes into erythrocytes. Elimination Metabolism : Ondansetron is extensively metabolized in humans, with approximately 5% of a radiolabeled dose recovered as the parent compound from the urine. The primary metabolic pathway is hydroxylation on the indole ring followed by subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. Although some nonconjugated metabolites have pharmacologic activity, these are not found in plasma at concentrations likely to significantly contribute to the biological activity of ondansetron. The metabolites are observed in the urine. In vitro metabolism studies have shown that ondansetron is a substrate for multiple human hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. In terms of overall ondansetron turnover, CYP3A4 plays a predominant role while formation of the major in vivo metabolites is apparently mediated by CYP1A2. The role of CYP2D6 in ondansetron in vivo metabolism is relatively minor. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous ondansetron did not differ between subjects who were poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 and those who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, further supporting the limited role of CYP2D6 in ondansetron disposition in vivo. Excretion : In adult cancer patients, the mean ondansetron elimination half\u2011life was 4.0 hours, and there was no difference in the multidose pharmacokinetics over a 4\u2011day period. In a dose-proportionality trial, systemic exposure to 32 mg of ondansetron was not proportional to dose as measured by comparing dose-normalized AUC values with an 8\u2011mg dose. This is consistent with a small decrease in systemic clearance with increasing plasma concentrations. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients : A reduction in clearance and increase in elimination half\u2011life are seen in patients older than 75 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Pediatric Patients : Pharmacokinetic samples were collected from 74 cancer patients aged 6 to 48 months, who received a dose of 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron every 4 hours for 3 doses during a safety and efficacy trial. These data were combined with sequential pharmacokinetics data from 41 surgery patients aged 1 month to 24 months, who received a single dose of 0.1 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron prior to surgery with general anesthesia, and a population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on the combined data set. The results of this analysis are included in Table 5 and are compared with the pharmacokinetic results in cancer patients aged 4 to 18 years. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, cancer patients aged 6 to 48 months who receive a dose of 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron every 4 hours for 3 doses would be expected to achieve a systemic exposure (AUC) consistent with the exposure achieved in previous pediatric trials in cancer patients (4 to 18 years) at similar doses. In a trial of 21 pediatric patients (3 to 12 years) who were undergoing surgery requiring anesthesia for a duration of 45 minutes to 2 hours, a single intravenous dose of ondansetron, 2 mg (3 to 7 years) or 4 mg (8 to 12 years), was administered immediately prior to anesthesia induction. Mean weight\u2011normalized clearance and volume of distribution values in these pediatric surgical patients were similar to those previously reported for young adults. Mean terminal half\u2011life was slightly reduced in pediatric patients (range: 2.5 to 3 hours) in comparison with adults (range: 3 to 3.5 hours). In a trial of 51 pediatric patients (aged 1 month to 24 months) who were undergoing surgery requiring general anesthesia, a single intravenous dose of ondansetron, 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg, was administered prior to surgery. As shown in Table 6, the 41 patients with pharmacokinetic data were divided into 2 groups, patients aged 1 month to 4 months and patients aged 5 to 24 months, and are compared with pediatric patients aged 3 to 12 years. In general, surgical and cancer pediatric patients younger than 18 years tend to have a higher ondansetron clearance compared with adults leading to a shorter half-life in most pediatric patients. In patients aged 1 month to 4 months, a longer half-life was observed due to the higher volume of distribution in this age-group. In a trial of 21 pediatric cancer patients (aged 4 to 18 years) who received three intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron at 4\u2011hour intervals, patients older than 15 years exhibited ondansetron pharmacokinetic parameters similar to those of adults. Patients with Renal Impairment : Due to the very small contribution (5%) of renal clearance to the overall clearance, renal impairment was not expected to significantly influence the total clearance of ondansetron. However, ondansetron mean plasma clearance was reduced by about 41% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). This reduction in clearance is variable and was not consistent with an increase in half\u2011life [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : In patients with mild\u2011to\u2011moderate hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced 2-fold and mean half\u2011life is increased to 11.6 hours compared with 5.7 hours in those without hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2011Pugh score of 10 or greater), clearance is reduced 2-fold to 3-fold and apparent volume of distribution is increased with a resultant increase in half\u2011life to 20 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interaction Studies CYP 3A4 Inducers : Ondansetron elimination may be affected by cytochrome P-450 inducers. In a pharmacokinetic trial of 16 epileptic patients maintained chronically on CYP3A4 inducers, carbamazepine, or phenytoin, a reduction in AUC, Cmax, and t\u00bd of ondansetron was observed. This resulted in a significant increase in the clearance of ondansetron. In a pharmacokinetic study of 10 healthy subjects receiving a single-dose intravenous dose of ondansetron 8 mg after 600 mg rifampin once daily for five days, the AUC and the t\u00bd of ondansetron were reduced by 48% and 46%, respectively. These changes in ondansetron exposure with CYP3A4 inducers are not thought to be clinically relevant [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Chemotherapeutic Agents: Carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron [see Drug Interactions (7.6)].

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that reversibly binds to the thrombin active site. Argatroban does not require the co-factor antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Argatroban exerts its anticoagulant effects by inhibiting thrombin-catalyzed or -induced reactions, including fibrin formation; activation of coagulation factors V, VIII, and XIII; activation of protein C; and platelet aggregation. Argatroban inhibits thrombin with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.04 \u00b5M. At therapeutic concentrations, argatroban has little or no effect on related serine proteases (trypsin, factor Xa, plasmin, and kallikrein). Argatroban is capable of inhibiting the action of both free and clot-associated thrombin. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics When argatroban is administered by continuous infusion, anticoagulant effects and plasma concentrations of argatroban follow similar, predictable temporal response profiles, with low intersubject variability. Immediately upon initiation of argatroban infusion, anticoagulant effects are produced as plasma argatroban concentrations begin to rise. Steady-state levels of both drug and anticoagulant effect are typically attained within 1 to 3 hours and are maintained until the infusion is discontinued or the dosage adjusted. Steady-state plasma argatroban concentrations increase proportionally with dose (for infusion doses up to 40 mcg/kg/min in healthy subjects) and are well correlated with steady-state anticoagulant effects. For infusion doses up to 40 mcg/kg/min, argatroban increases in a dose-dependent fashion, the aPTT, the ACT, the prothrombin time (PT), the International Normalized Ratio (INR), and the thrombin time (TT) in healthy volunteers and cardiac patients. Representative steady-state plasma argatroban concentrations and anticoagulant effects are shown below for argatroban infusion doses up to 10 mcg/kg/min (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Relationship at Steady State Between Argatroban Dose, Plasma Argatroban Concentration and Anticoagulant Effect Effect on International Normalized Ratio (INR): Because argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor, coadministration of argatroban and warfarin produces a combined effect on the laboratory measurement of the INR. However, concurrent therapy, compared to warfarin monotherapy, exerts no additional effect on vitamin K\u2013dependent factor Xa activity. The relationship between INR on co-therapy and warfarin alone is dependent on both the dose of argatroban and the thromboplastin reagent used. This relationship is influenced by the International Sensitivity Index (ISI) of the thromboplastin. Data for 2 commonly utilized thromboplastins with ISI values of 0.88 (Innovin, Dade) and 1.78 (Thromboplastin C Plus, Dade) are presented in Figure 2 for an argatroban dose of 2 mcg/kg/min. Thromboplastins with higher ISI values than shown result in higher INRs on combined therapy of warfarin and argatroban. These data are based on results obtained in normal individuals [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ]. Figure 2. INR Relationship of Argatroban Plus Warfarin Versus Warfarin Alone Figure 2 demonstrates the relationship between INR for warfarin alone and INR for warfarin coadministered with argatroban at a dose of 2 mcg/kg/min. To calculate INR for warfarin alone (INR W ), based on INR for co-therapy of warfarin and argatroban (INR WA ), when the argatroban dose is 2 mcg/kg/min, use the equation next to the appropriate curve. Example: At a dose of 2 mcg/kg/min and an INR performed with Thromboplastin A, the equation 0.19 + 0.57 (INR WA ) = INR W would allow a prediction of the INR on warfarin alone (INR W ). Thus, using an INR WA value of 4.0 obtained on combined therapy: INR W = 0.19 + 0.57 (4) = 2.47 as the value for INR on warfarin alone. The error (confidence interval) associated with a prediction is \u00b1 0.4 units. Similar linear relationships and prediction errors exist for argatroban at a dose of 1 mcg/kg/min. Thus, for argatroban doses of 1 or 2 mcg/kg/min, INR W can be predicted from INR WA . For argatroban doses greater than 2 mcg/kg/min, the error associated with predicting INR W from INR WA is \u00b1 1. Thus, INR W cannot be reliably predicted from INR WA at doses greater than 2 mcg/kg/min. Figure 1 Figure2 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution: Argatroban distributes mainly in the extra cellular fluid as evidenced by an apparent steady-state volume of distribution of 174 mL/kg (12.18 L in a 70 kg adult). Argatroban is 54% bound to human serum proteins, with binding to albumin and \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein being 20% and 34%, respectively. Metabolism: The main route of argatroban metabolism is hydroxylation and aromatization of the 3-methyltetrahydroquinoline ring in the liver. The formation of each of the 4 known metabolites is catalyzed in vitro by the human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4/5. The primary metabolite (M1) exerts 3- to 5-fold weaker anticoagulant effects than argatroban. Unchanged argatroban is the major component in plasma. The plasma concentrations of M1 range between 0% and 20% of that of the parent drug. The other metabolites (M2 to M4) are found only in very low quantities in the urine and have not been detected in plasma or feces. These data, together with the lack of effect of erythromycin (a potent CYP3A4/5 inhibitor) on argatroban pharmacokinetics, suggest that CYP3A4/5-mediated metabolism is not an important elimination pathway in vivo . Total body clearance is approximately 5.1 mL/kg/min (0.31 L/kg/hr) for infusion doses up to 40 mcg/kg/min. The terminal elimination half-life of argatroban ranges between 39 and 51 minutes. There is no interconversion of the 21\u2013(R):21\u2013(S) diastereoisomers. The plasma ratio of these diastereoisomers is unchanged by metabolism or hepatic impairment, remaining constant at 65:35 (\u00b1 2%). Excretion: Argatroban is excreted primarily in the feces, presumably through biliary secretion. In a study in which 14 C-argatroban (5 mcg/kg/min) was infused for 4 hours into healthy subjects, approximately 65% of the radioactivity was recovered in the feces within 6 days of the start of infusion with little or no radioactivity subsequently detected. Approximately 22% of the radioactivity appeared in the urine within 12 hours of the start of infusion. Little or no additional urinary radioactivity was subsequently detected. Average percent recovery of unchanged drug, relative to total dose, was 16% in urine and at least 14% in feces. Special Populations: Hepatic Impairment: The dosage of argatroban should be decreased in patients with hepatic impairment [s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Patients with hepatic impairment were not studied in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) trials. At a dose of 2.5 mcg/kg/min, hepatic impairment is associated with decreased clearance and increased elimination half-life of argatroban (to 1.9 mL/kg/min and 181 minutes, respectively, for patients with a Child-Pugh score greater than 6). Renal Impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal dysfunction. The effect of renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of argatroban was studied in 6 subjects with normal renal function (mean Clcr = 95 \u00b1 16 mL/min) and in 18 subjects with mild (mean Clcr = 64 \u00b1 10 mL/min), moderate (mean Clcr = 41 \u00b1 5.8 mL/min), and severe (mean Clcr = 5 \u00b1 7 mL/min) renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of argatroban at dosages up to 5 mcg/kg/min were not significantly affected by renal dysfunction. Use of argatroban was evaluated in a study of 12 patients with stable end-stage renal disease undergoing chronic intermittent hemodialysis. Argatroban was administered at a rate of 2 to 3 mcg/kg/min (begun at least 4 hours prior to dialysis) or as a bolus dose of 250 mcg/kg at the start of dialysis followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mcg/kg/min. Although these regimens did not achieve the goal of maintaining ACT values at 1.8 times the baseline value throughout most of the hemodialysis period, the hemodialysis sessions were successfully completed with both of these regimens. The mean ACTs produced in this study ranged from 1.39 to 1.82 times baseline, and the mean aPTTs ranged from 1.96 to 3.4 times baseline. When argatroban was administered as a continuous infusion of 2 mcg/kg/min prior to and during a 4-hour hemodialysis session, approximately 20% was cleared through dialysis. Age, Gender: There are no clinically significant effects of age or gender on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (e.g., aPTT) of argatroban in adults. Drug-Drug Interactions: Digoxin: In 12 healthy volunteers, intravenous infusion of argatroban (2 mcg/kg/min) over 5 days (study days 11 to 15) did not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of oral digoxin (0.375 mg daily for 15 days). Erythromycin: In 10 healthy subjects, orally administered erythromycin (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5) at 500 mg four times daily for 7 days had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of argatroban at a dose of 1 mcg/kg/min for 5 hours. These data suggest oxidative metabolism by CYP3A4/5 is not an important elimination pathway in vivo for argatroban. Aspirin and Acetaminophen: Drug-drug interactions have not been demonstrated between argatroban and concomitantly administered aspirin (162.5 mg orally given 26 and 2 hours prior to initiation of argatroban 1 mcg/kg/min over 4 hours) or acetaminophen (1,000 mg orally given 12, 6, and 0 hours prior to, and 6 and 12 hours subsequent to, initiation of argatroban 1.5 mcg/kg/min over 18 hours)."], "manufacturer_name": ["Endo USA, Inc."], "substance_name": ["ARGATROBAN"], "effective_time": "20230801", "product_ndc": ["42023-182"], "brand_name": ["Argatroban"]}
