{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS Studies have shown that properly performed an interpreted skin tests with ragweed pollen extract are useful in the diagnosis of allergy to ragweed pollen 7, 8, 20, 21 . Immunotherapy with the appropriate dosage of short ragweed pollen extract is effective in reducing symptoms of hay fever and asthma resulting from exposure to short ragweed pollen (9, 10, 11), and it is believed to be effective with extract of giant ragweed, although carefully controlled studies are unavailable. However, clinical observations and known cross reactivity between short and giant ragweed pollens have led to the practice of using a mixture of the two species for skin testing and treatment 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 . This form of treatment is recommended for patients who cannot avoid exposure to pollen and who do not obtain satisfactory relief of symptoms from other medications, such as antihistamines. Immunologic changes resulting from treatment with short ragweed pollen extract are believed to include: The induction of specific anti-ragweed IgG antibodies commonly referred to as \"blocking antibodies\" 12, 13 . A decrease in the elevation of ragweed specific IgE during and immediately following the ragweed pollen season 14 . A reduction of circulating anti-ragweed IgE after long-term immunotherapy 15 . A decrease in skin reactivity to the extract 16 and a decrease in leukocyte sensitivity to histamine release 17 after long-term immunotherapy."], "generic_name": ["AMBROSIA ARTEMISIIFOLIA"], "id": "21dcef59-8042-ec6f-e063-6394a90a2c01", "route": ["CUTANEOUS", "INTRADERMAL", "SUBCUTANEOUS"], "description": ["DESCRIPTION INGREDIENTS - Allergenic extract of short ragweed pollen is a clear, amber-colored solution prepared from the dry, defatted pollen of Ambrosia elatior . The extract contains the water extractables of the pollen, 0.25% sodium chloride, 0.125% sodium bicarbonate, 0.5% phenol and 50% glycerol by volume. Extract of mixed short-giant ragweed has the same appearance as short ragweed pollen extract and contains the same chemical ingredients. It is prepared from equal gram weights of the pollens of Ambrosia elatior and Ambrosia trifida . STANDARDIZATION - The potency of ragweed pollen extract is based on antigen E, a protein component which is believed to be the most important allergen of short ragweed pollen. Extracts of short ragweed pollen sold in the U.S. must have a minimum antigen E content of 67.5 units per ml for a 1:20 w/v concentrate. Extracts of mixed short-giant ragweed must have a minimum antigen E content of 33.75 units/ml for a 1:20 w/v concentrate. The importance of antigen E in ragweed allergy is based on the following observations: In vitro studies with antigen E have shown that it is capable of causing histamine release from peripheral leukocytes of ragweed sensitive persons 1 . The antigen E content of short ragweed pollen extract has been found to correlate with extract potency when measured by skin test response in persons allergic to short ragweed pollen 2 . Immunotherapy with antigen E has been shown to be comparably effective to whole short ragweed pollen extract in reducing symptoms related to ragweed pollen exposure 3 . The weight by volume value shown on the label is a measurement of extract concentration, rather than extract potency. Weight by volume designations may be used to identify dilutions of extract for skin testing and immunotherapy, and are useful from a practical standpoint in identifying the relative strength of a given extract. However, studies have shown that the antigen E content varies in extracts with the same weight by volume concentration 4 . EXPIRATION DATING - Expiration dating is based on the antigen E content of the extract. Extracts containing 50% glycerol by volume have longer dating periods due to the protective effects of glycerol on antigen E 5, 6 . The expiration period of aqueous concentrate and saline dilutions of glycerinated concentrate is approximately one-half that of glycerinated extract containing comparable antigen E content. Ragweed extract should be kept at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C during use and office storage to retain potency. Higher temperatures have an adverse affect on antigen E."], "manufacturer_name": ["Allermed Laboratories, Inc."], "substance_name": ["AMBROSIA ARTEMISIIFOLIA POLLEN"], "effective_time": "20240911", "product_ndc": ["49643-315"], "brand_name": ["Short Ragweed"]}
