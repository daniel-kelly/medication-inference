Taurolidine Taurolidine is an antimicrobial agent derived from the naturally occurring amino acid taurine. The chemical name is 4,4'-methylenebis(1,2,4-thiadiazinane)-1,1,1',1'-tetraoxide. The molecular weight is 284.36, and the molecular formula is C 7 H 16 N 4 O 4 S 2 . The structural formula of taurolidine is: Heparin Sodium Heparin is an anticoagulant consisting of heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic mucopolysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans. It is composed of polymers of alternating derivatives of \u03b1-D-glucosamido ( N -sulfated, O -sulfated, or N -acetylated) and O -sulfated uronic acid (\u03b1-L-iduronic acid or \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid). Heparin is derived from porcine intestinal mucosa. The structure of heparin sodium (representative subunits) is: DEFENCATH is for central venous catheter instillation use. DEFENCATH CLS is available as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, preservative-free, clear, aqueous-based solution of taurolidine and heparin with a pH of 5.5-6.5 in the following strengths: 3 mL of catheter lock solution in a single-dose vial containing taurolidine 40.5 mg/3 mL (13.5 mg/mL), and heparin 3,000 USP Units/3 mL (1,000 USP Units/mL) 5 mL of catheter lock solution in a single-dose vial containing taurolidine 67.5 mg/5 mL (13.5 mg/mL), and heparin 5,000 USP Units/5 mL (1,000 USP Units/mL) The heparin potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard based on units of heparin activity per milligram. The inactive ingredients are 26.1 mg/mL of citric acid, anhydrous (which is added to control pH and maintain the solubility of taurolidine),and may include hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment.

Small amounts of heparin inhibit Factor Xa, and larger amounts inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa). Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor. Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots. Taurolidine Taurolidine is an antimicrobial drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of DEFENCATH are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted because DEFENCATH is intended to be instilled into the catheter lumens at the conclusion of each HD session for patients with kidney failure requiring chronic HD. DEFENCATH is not intended for systemic administration [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of taurolidine and its metabolites is non-specific, causing damage to microbial cell walls and inhibiting adherence of microorganisms to biological surfaces. Resistance Time kill studies showed that taurolidine is bactericidal (>3 log 10 CFU reduction) at 1x to 4x minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The frequency of resistant mutants was <10 -9 at 2x and 4x MIC for two strains each of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . 1 Antimicrobial Activity The following in vitro data are available but their clinical significance is unknown. Taurolidine has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms: Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) Staphylococcus epidermidis Enterococcus faecalis Gram-negative Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae Pseudomonas aeruginosa Serratia marcescens Fungi Candida albicans Candida glabrata"], "manufacturer_name": ["CorMedix Inc."], "substance_name": ["HEPARIN", "TAUROLIDINE"], "effective_time": "20241223", "product_ndc": ["72990-103", "72990-105"], "brand_name": ["DEFENCATH"]}
