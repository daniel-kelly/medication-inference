Baclofen's pharmacological class is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic agonist. Baclofen's chemical name is 4-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl) butanoic acid, and its structural formula is: Baclofen C 10 H 12 ClNO 2 Baclofen is a white to off-white powder, with a molecular weight of 213.66. It is slightly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in methanol and ethanol, practically insoluble in acetone and ether, soluble in 0.1N hydrochloric acid, 0.1N sodium hydroxide, and insoluble in chloroform. GABLOFEN is a sterile, pyrogen-free, isotonic solution free of antioxidants, preservatives or other potentially neurotoxic additives indicated only for intrathecal administration. The drug is stable in solution at 37\u00b0C and compatible with CSF.

Baclofen inhibits both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level, possibly by decreasing excitatory neurotransmitter release from primary afferent terminals, although actions at supraspinal sites may also occur and contribute to its clinical effect. Baclofen is a structural analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and may exert its effects by stimulation of the GABAB receptor subtype. Baclofen when introduced directly into the intrathecal space permits effective CSF concentrations to be achieved with resultant plasma concentrations 100 times less than those occurring with oral administration. In people, as well as in animals, baclofen has been shown to have general CNS depressant properties as indicated by the production of sedation with tolerance, somnolence, ataxia, and respiratory and cardiovascular depression. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Intrathecal Bolus Adult Patients The onset of action is generally one-half hour to one hour after an intrathecal bolus. Peak spasmolytic effect is seen at approximately four hours after dosing and effects may last four to eight hours. Onset, peak response, and duration of action may vary with individual patients depending on the dose and severity of symptoms. Pediatric Patients The onset, peak response and duration of action are similar to those seen in adult patients. Continuous Infusion Adult Patients Intrathecal baclofen's antispastic action is first seen at 6 to 8 hours after initiation of continuous infusion. Maximum activity is observed in 24 to 48 hours. Pediatric Patients No additional information on continuous infusions is available for pediatric patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clearance of intrathecal baclofen calculated from intrathecal bolus or continuous infusion studies approximates CSF turnover, suggesting elimination is by bulk-flow removal of CSF. Intrathecal Bolus After a bolus lumbar injection of 50 mcg or 100 mcg intrathecal baclofen in seven patients, the average CSF elimination half-life was 1.51 hours over the first four hours and the average CSF clearance was approximately 30 mL/hour. Continuous Infusion The mean CSF clearance for intrathecal baclofen was approximately 30 mL/hour in a study involving ten patients on continuous intrathecal infusion. Concurrent plasma concentrations of baclofen during intrathecal administration are expected to be low (0 to 5 ng/mL). Limited pharmacokinetic data suggest that a lumbar-cisternal concentration gradient of about 4:1 is established along the neuroaxis during baclofen infusion. This is based upon simultaneous CSF sampling via cisternal and lumbar tap in 5 patients receiving continuous baclofen infusion at the lumbar level at doses associated with therapeutic efficacy; the interpatient variability was great.

{"indications_and_usage": ["INDICATIONS AND USAGE Acute Infections Caused by Susceptible Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Polymyxin B sulfate is a drug of choice in the treatment of infections of the urinary tract, meninges, and bloodstream caused by susceptible strains of Ps. aeruginosa. It may also be used topically and subconjunctivally in the treatment of infections of the eye caused by susceptible strains of Ps. aeruginosa . It may be indicated in serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the following organisms, when less potentially toxic drugs are ineffective or contraindicated: H influenzae , specifically meningeal infections. Escherichia coli , specifically urinary tract infections. Aerobacter aerogenes , specifically bacteremia. Klebsiella pneumoniae , specifically bacteremia. NOTE: IN MENINGEAL INFECTIONS, POLYMYXIN B SULFATE SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED ONLY BY THE INTRATHECAL ROUTE. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of polymyxin B and other antibacterial drugs, polymyxin B should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."], "generic_name": ["POLYMYXIN B SULFATE"], "id": "dc529b6b-bbf4-44da-a829-f506c41d47f6", "route": ["INTRAMUSCULAR", "INTRATHECAL", "INTRAVENOUS", "OPHTHALMIC"], "description": ["DESCRIPTION Polymyxin B for Injection, USP is one of a group of basic polypeptide antibiotics derived from B polymyxa (B aerosporous) . Polymyxin B sulfate is the sulfate salt of Polymyxins B 1 and B 2 , which are produced by the growth of Bacillus polymyxa (Prazmowski) Migula (Fam. Bacillacea). It has a potency of not less than 6000 polymyxin B units per mg, calculated on the anhydrous basis. The structural formulae are: Each vial contains Polymyxin B Sulfate equivalent to 500,000 polymyxin B units for parenteral or ophthalmic administration. Polymyxin B for Injection, USP is in powder form suitable for preparation of sterile solutions for intramuscular, intravenous drip, intrathecal, or ophthalmic use. In the medical literature, dosages have frequently been given in terms of equivalent weights of pure polymyxin B base. Each milligram of pure polymyxin B base is equivalent to 10,000 units of polymyxin B and each microgram of pure polymyxin B base is equivalent to 10 units of polymyxin B. Aqueous solutions of polymyxin B sulfate may be stored up to 12 months without significant loss of potency if kept under refrigeration. In the interest of safety, solutions for parenteral use should be stored under refrigeration and any unused portion should be discarded after 72 hours. Polymyxin B sulfate should not be stored in alkaline solutions since they are less stable. structural formula"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Polymyxin B sulfate has a bactericidal action against almost all gram-negative bacilli except the Proteus group. Polymyxins increase the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane leading to death of the cell. All gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and gram-negative cocci are resistant to polymyxin B. For specific information regarding susceptibility test criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC. Polymyxin B sulfate is not absorbed from the normal alimentary tract. Since the drug loses 50 percent of its activity in the presence of serum, active blood levels are low. Repeated injections may give a cumulative effect. Levels tend to be higher in infants and children. The drug is excreted slowly by the kidneys. Tissue diffusion is poor and the drug does not pass the blood brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid. In therapeutic dosage, polymyxin B sulfate causes some nephrotoxicity with tubule damage to a slight degree."], "manufacturer_name": ["Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc."], "substance_name": ["POLYMYXIN B SULFATE"], "effective_time": "20220428", "product_ndc": ["0143-9941"], "brand_name": ["Polymyxin B"]}
