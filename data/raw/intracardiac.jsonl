Diastolic pressure falls. Renal blood flow is decreased in normotensive subjects but is increased markedly in shock. Systolic blood pressure may remain unchanged or rise, although mean arterial pressure typically falls. Cardiac output is increased because of the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of the drug in the face of diminished peripheral vascular resistance. Isoproterenol relaxes almost all varieties of smooth muscle when the tone is high, but this action is most pronounced on bronchial and gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It prevents or relieves bronchoconstriction, but tolerance to this effect develops with overuse of the drug. In man, isoproterenol causes less hyperglycemia than does epinephrine. Isoproterenol and epinephrine are equally effective in stimulating the release of free fatty acids and energy production. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Isoproterenol is readily absorbed when given parenterally or as an aerosol. Elimination Isoproterenol is metabolized primarily in the liver and other tissues by COMT. Isoproterenol is a relatively poor substrate for MAO and is not taken up by sympathetic neurons to the same extent as are epinephrine and norepinephrine. The duration of action of isoproterenol may therefore be longer than that of epinephrine but is still brief."], "manufacturer_name": ["Nordic Pharma, Inc."], "substance_name": ["ISOPROTERENOL HYDROCHLORIDE"], "effective_time": "20240627", "product_ndc": ["69918-731", "69918-735"], "brand_name": ["Isoproterenol Hydrochloride"]}
