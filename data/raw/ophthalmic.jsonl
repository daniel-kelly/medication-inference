This binding is stronger for the bacterial enzyme than for the corresponding mammalian enzyme and therefore selectively interferes with bacterial biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. Polymyxin B, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, is bactericidal for a variety of gram-negative organisms, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It increases the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane by interacting with the phospholipid components of the membrane.

When instilled into the eye, IOPIDINE 1% (apraclonidine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution) has the action of reducing intraocular pressure (IOP). Ophthalmic apraclonidine has minimal effect on cardiovascular parameters. Optic nerve head damage and visual field loss may result from an acute elevation in IOP that can occur after argon or Nd:YAG laser surgical procedures. Elevated IOP, whether acute or chronic in duration, is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of visual field loss. The higher the peak or spike of IOP, the greater the likelihood of visual field loss and optic nerve damage especially in patients with previously compromised optic nerves. The onset of action with IOPIDINE 1% Ophthalmic Solution can usually be noted within one hour and the maximum IOP reduction usually occurs three to five hours after application of a single dose. The precise mechanism of the ocular hypotensive action of IOPIDINE 1% Ophthalmic Solution is not completely established at this time.

Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma, by reducing aqueous humor secretion. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Dorzolamide hydrochloride is an inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase II. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. Timolol maleate is a beta1 and beta2 (non-selective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. The combined effect of these two agents administered as dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily results in additional intraocular pressure reduction compared to either component administered alone, but the reduction is not as much as when dorzolamide administered three times daily and timolol twice daily are administered concomitantly. [See Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Dorzolamide Hydrochloride When topically applied, dorzolamide reaches the systemic circulation. To assess the potential for systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibition following topical administration, drug and metabolite concentrations in RBCs and plasma and carbonic anhydrase inhibition in RBCs were measured. Dorzolamide accumulates in RBCs during chronic dosing as a result of binding to CA-II. The parent drug forms a single N-desethyl metabolite, which inhibits CA-II less potently than the parent drug but also inhibits CA-I. The metabolite also accumulates in RBCs where it binds primarily to CA-I. Plasma concentrations of dorzolamide and metabolite are generally below the assay limit of quantitation (15nM). Dorzolamide binds moderately to plasma proteins (approximately 33%). Dorzolamide is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine; the metabolite also is excreted in urine. After dosing is stopped, dorzolamide washes out of RBCs nonlinearly, resulting in a rapid decline of drug concentration initially, followed by a slower elimination phase with a half-life of about four months. To simulate the systemic exposure after long-term topical ocular administration, dorzolamide was given orally to eight healthy subjects for up to 20 weeks. The oral dose of 2 mg twice daily closely approximates the amount of drug delivered by topical ocular administration of dorzolamide 2% three times daily. Steady state was reached within 8 weeks. The inhibition of CA-II and total carbonic anhydrase activities was below the degree of inhibition anticipated to be necessary for a pharmacological effect on renal function and respiration in healthy individuals.

Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade reduces cardiac output in both healthy subjects and patients with heart disease. In patients with severe impairment of myocardial function, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may inhibit the stimulatory effect of the sympathetic nervous system necessary to maintain adequate cardiac function. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in the bronchi and bronchioles results in increased airway resistance from unopposed parasympathetic activity. Such an effect in patients with asthma or other bronchospastic conditions is potentially dangerous. Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution, when applied topically on the eye, has the action of reducing elevated as well as normal intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. The onset of reduction in intraocular pressure following administration of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution can usually be detected within one-half hour after a single dose. The maximum effect usually occurs in one to two hours, and significant lowering of intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods as long as 24 hours with a single dose. Repeated observations over a period of one year indicate that the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution is well maintained. The precise mechanism of the ocular hypotensive action of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution is not clearly established at this time. Tonography and fluorophotometry studies in man suggest that its predominant action may be related to reduced aqueous formation.

Preservative: benzalkonium chloride 0.01%. Inactives: hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide (to adjust pH), purified water, sodium acetate, and sodium chloride. image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Apraclonidine hydrochloride is a relatively selective alpha-2-adrenergic agonist. When instilled in the eye, apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0.5%, has the action of reducing elevated, as well as normal, intraocular pressure (IOP), whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Ophthalmic apraclonidine has minimal effect on cardiovascular parameters. Elevated IOP presents a major risk factor in glaucomatous field loss. The higher the level of IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss. Apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0.5% has the action of reducing IOP. The onset of action of apraclonidine can usually be noted within one hour, and maximum IOP reduction occurs about three hours after instillation. Aqueous fluorophotometry studies demonstrate that apraclonidine's predominant mechanism of action is reduction of aqueous flow via stimulation of the alpha-adrenergic system. Repeated dose-response and comparative studies (0.125%-1.0% apraclonidine) demonstrate that 0.5% apraclonidine is at the top of the dose-response IOP reduction curve. The clinical utility of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0.5% is most apparent for those glaucoma patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy. Patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy with uncontrolled IOP, and scheduled to undergo laser trabeculoplasty or trabeculectomy surgery were enrolled into a double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial to determine if apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0.5%, dosed three times daily, could delay the need for surgery for up to three months. All patients enrolled into this trial had advanced glaucoma and were undergoing maximally tolerated medical therapy, i.e., patients were using combinations of a topical beta blocker, sympathomimetics, parasympathomimetics and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Patients were considered to be treatment failures in this study if, in the opinion of the investigators, their IOP was uncontrolled by the masked study medication or there was evidence of further optic nerve damage or visual field loss, and surgery was indicated. Of 171 patients receiving masked medication, 84 were treated with apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0.5% and 87 were treated with placebo (apraclonidine vehicle). Apraclonidine treatment resulted in a significantly greater percentage of treatment successes compared to patients treated with placebo. In this placebo-controlled maximum therapy trial, 14.3% of patients treated with apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0.5% were discontinued due to adverse events, primarily allergic-like reactions (12.9%). The IOP lowering efficacy of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0.5% diminishes over time in some patients. This loss of effect, or tachyphylaxis, appears to be an individual occurrence with a variable time of onset and should be closely monitored. An unpredictable decrease of IOP control in some patients, incidence of ocular allergic responses and systemic side effects, may limit the utility of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0.5%. However, patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy may still benefit from the additional IOP reduction provided by the short-term use of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0.5%. Topical use of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0.5% leads to systemic absorption. Studies of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0.5% dosed one drop three times a day in both eyes for 10 days, in normal volunteers, yielded mean peak and trough concentrations of 0.9 ng/mL and 0.5 ng/mL, respectively. The half-life of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0.5% was calculated to be 8 hours. Apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0.5%, because of its alpha adrenergic activity, is a vasoconstrictor.

Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body including the eye. It catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In humans, carbonic anhydrase exists as a number of isoenzymes, the most active being carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II), found primarily in red blood cells (RBCs), but also in other tissues. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. The result is a reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP). Dorzolamide hydrochloride ophthalmic solution contains dorzolamide hydrochloride, an inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase II. Following topical ocular administration, dorzolamide hydrochloride ophthalmic solution reduces elevated intraocular pressure. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics When topically applied, dorzolamide reaches the systemic circulation. To assess the potential for systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibition following topical administration, drug and metabolite concentrations in RBCs and plasma and carbonic anhydrase inhibition in RBCs were measured. Dorzolamide accumulates in RBCs during chronic dosing as a result of binding to CA-II. The parent drug forms a single N-desethyl metabolite, which inhibits CA-II less potently than the parent drug but also inhibits CA-I. The metabolite also accumulates in RBCs where it binds primarily to CA-I. Plasma concentrations of dorzolamide and metabolite are generally below the assay limit of quantitation (15nM). Dorzolamide binds moderately to plasma proteins (approximately 33%). Dorzolamide is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine; the metabolite also is excreted in urine. After dosing is stopped, dorzolamide washes out of RBCs nonlinearly, resulting in a rapid decline of drug concentration initially, followed by a slower elimination phase with a half-life of about four months. To simulate the systemic exposure after long-term topical ocular administration, dorzolamide was given orally to eight healthy subjects for up to 20 weeks. The oral dose of 2 mg twice daily closely approximates the amount of drug delivered by topical ocular administration of dorzolamide 2% three times daily. Steady state was reached within 8 weeks.

They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. It is highly lipid soluble which enhances its penetration into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivo and in vitro preclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days.

Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30% to 40% lower with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known.

Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Dorzolamide hydrochloride is an inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase II. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 (non-selective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane- stabilizing) activity. The combined effect of these two agents administered as dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily results in additional intraocular pressure reduction compared to either component administered alone, but the reduction is not as much as when dorzolamide administered three times daily and timolol twice daily are administered concomitantly. [See Clinical Studies (14) .] 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Dorzolamide Hydrochloride When topically applied, dorzolamide reaches the systemic circulation. To assess the potential for systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibition following topical administration, drug and metabolite concentrations in RBCs and plasma and carbonic anhydrase inhibition in RBCs were measured. Dorzolamide accumulates in RBCs during chronic dosing as a result of binding to CA-II. The parent drug forms a single N-desethyl metabolite, which inhibits CA-II less potently than the parent drug but also inhibits CA-I. The metabolite also accumulates in RBCs where it binds primarily to CA-I. Plasma concentrations of dorzolamide and metabolite are generally below the assay limit of quantitation (15nM). Dorzolamide binds moderately to plasma proteins (approximately 33%). Dorzolamide is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine; the metabolite also is excreted in urine. After dosing is stopped, dorzolamide washes out of RBCs nonlinearly, resulting in a rapid decline of drug concentration initially, followed by a slower elimination phase with a half-life of about four months. To simulate the systemic exposure after long-term topical ocular administration, dorzolamide was given orally to eight healthy subjects for up to 20 weeks. The oral dose of 2 mg twice daily closely approximates the amount of drug delivered by topical ocular administration of dorzolamide 2% three times daily. Steady state was reached within 8 weeks. The inhibition of CA-II and total carbonic anhydrase activities was below the degree of inhibition anticipated to be necessary for a pharmacological effect on renal function and respiration in healthy individuals.

It catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In humans, carbonic anhydrase exists as a number of isoenzymes, the most active being carbonic anhydrase II, found primarily in red blood cells (RBCs), but also in other tissues. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. The result is a reduction in IOP. AZOPT contains brinzolamide, an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase II. Following topical ocular administration, brinzolamide inhibits aqueous humor formation and reduces elevated IOP. Elevated IOP is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical ocular administration, brinzolamide is absorbed into the systemic circulation. Due to its affinity for carbonic anhydrase II, brinzolamide distributes extensively into the RBCs and exhibits a long half-life in whole blood (approximately 111 days). In humans, the metabolite N-desethyl brinzolamide is formed, which also binds to carbonic anhydrase and accumulates in RBCs. This metabolite binds mainly to carbonic anhydrase I in the presence of brinzolamide. In plasma, both parent brinzolamide and N-desethyl brinzolamide concentrations are low and generally below assay quantitation limits (less than 10 ng/mL). Binding to plasma proteins is approximately 60%. Brinzolamide is eliminated predominantly in the urine as unchanged drug. N-Desethyl brinzolamide is also found in the urine along with lower concentrations of the N-desmethoxypropyl and O-desmethyl metabolites. An oral pharmacokinetic study was conducted in which healthy volunteers received 1 mg capsules of brinzolamide twice per day for up to 32 weeks. This regimen approximates the amount of drug delivered by topical ocular administration of AZOPT dosed to both eyes 3 times per day and simulates systemic drug and metabolite concentrations similar to those achieved with long-term topical dosing. Red blood cell carbonic anhydrase activity was measured to assess the degree of systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Brinzolamide saturation of RBC carbonic anhydrase II was achieved within 4 weeks (RBC concentrations of approximately 20 mcM). N-Desethyl brinzolamide accumulated in RBCs to steady-state within 20 to 28 weeks reaching concentrations ranging from 6 to 30 mcM. The inhibition of carbonic anhydrase II activity at steady-state was approximately 70% to 75%, which is below the degree of inhibition expected to have a pharmacological effect on renal function or respiration in healthy subjects."], "manufacturer_name": ["Sandoz Inc"], "substance_name": ["BRINZOLAMIDE"], "effective_time": "20231124", "product_ndc": ["66758-085"], "brand_name": ["Azopt"]}

To assess the potential for systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibition following topical administration, drug and metabolite concentrations in RBCs and plasma and carbonic anhydrase inhibition in RBCs were measured. Dorzolamide accumulates in RBCs during chronic dosing as a result of binding to CA-II. The parent drug forms a single N-desethyl metabolite, which inhibits CA-II less potently than the parent drug but also inhibits CA-I. The metabolite also accumulates in RBCs where it binds primarily to CA-I. Plasma concentrations of dorzolamide and metabolite are generally below the assay limit of quantitation (15nM). Dorzolamide binds moderately to plasma proteins (approximately 33%). Dorzolamide is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine; the metabolite also is excreted in urine. After dosing is stopped, dorzolamide washes out of RBCs nonlinearly, resulting in a rapid decline of drug concentration initially, followed by a slower elimination phase with a half-life of about four months. To simulate the systemic exposure after long-term topical ocular administration, dorzolamide was given orally to eight healthy subjects for up to 20 weeks. The oral dose of 2 mg twice daily closely approximates the amount of drug delivered by topical ocular administration of dorzolamide 2% three times daily. Steady state was reached within 8 weeks.

Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade reduces cardiac output in both healthy subjects and patients with heart disease. In patients with severe impairment of myocardial function, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may inhibit the stimulatory effect of the sympathetic nervous system necessary to maintain adequate cardiac function. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in the bronchi and bronchioles results in increased airway resistance from unopposed parasympathetic activity. Such an effect in patients with asthma or other bronchospastic conditions is potentially dangerous. Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution, when applied topically on the eye, has the action of reducing elevated as well as normal intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. The onset of reduction in intraocular pressure following administration of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution can usually be detected within one-half hour after a single dose. The maximum effect usually occurs in one to two hours, and significant lowering of intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods as long as 24 hours with a single dose. Repeated observations over a period of one year indicate that the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution is well maintained. The precise mechanism of the ocular hypotensive action of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution is not clearly established at this time. Tonography and fluorophotometry studies in man suggest that its predominant action may be related to reduced aqueous formation. However, in some studies a slight increase in outflow facility was also observed. Pharmacokinetics In a study of plasma drug concentration in six subjects, the systemic exposure to timolol was determined following twice daily administration of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution 0.5%. The mean peak plasma concentration following morning dosing was 0.46 ng/mL and following afternoon dosing was 0.35 ng/mL. Clinical Studies In controlled multiclinic studies in patients with untreated intraocular pressures of 22 mmHg or greater, Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution 0.25 or 0.5% administered twice a day produced a greater reduction in intraocular pressure than 1, 2, 3, or 4% pilocarpine solution administered four times a day or 0.5, 1, or 2% epinephrine hydrochloride solution administered twice a day. In these studies, Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution was generally well tolerated and produced fewer and less severe side effects than either pilocarpine or epinephrine.

The mean steady-state C max (2.7 ng/mL) and AUC 0-\u221e (41.9 ng\u2022hr/mL) values were 1600 and 1100 times lower than the mean C max and AUC reported after therapeutic 400 mg doses of moxifloxacin. The plasma half-life of moxifloxacin was estimated to be 3 hours. 12.4 Microbiology The antibacterial action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme that is involved in the replication, transcription and repair of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme known to play a key role in the partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division. The mechanism of action for quinolones, including moxifloxacin, is different from that of macrolides, aminoglycosides, or tetracyclines. Therefore, moxifloxacin may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics and these antibiotics may be active against pathogens that are resistant to moxifloxacin. There is no cross-resistance between moxifloxacin and the aforementioned classes of antibiotics. Cross resistance has been observed between systemic moxifloxacin and some other quinolones. In vitro resistance to moxifloxacin develops via multiple-step mutations. Resistance to moxifloxacin occurs in vitro at a general frequency of between 1.8 x 10 -9 to less than 1 x 10 -11 for gram-positive bacteria. Moxifloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the Indications and Usage section: Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms: Corynebacterium species* Micrococcus luteus* Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Staphylococcus haemolyticus Staphylococcus hominis Staphylococcus warneri* Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus viridans group Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms: Acinetobacter lwoffii* Haemophilus influenzae Haemophilus parainfluenzae* Other microorganisms: Chlamydia trachomatis *Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections. The following in vitro data are also available, but their clinical significance in ophthalmic infections is unknown . The safety and effectiveness of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in treating ophthalmological infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials. The following organisms are considered susceptible when evaluated using systemic breakpoints. However, a correlation between the in vitro systemic breakpoint and ophthalmological efficacy has not been established. The list of organisms is provided as guidance only in assessing the potential treatment of conjunctival infections.

Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30-40% lower with Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized-by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. S pecial Populations Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known.

At all time points, serum gatifloxacin levels were below the lower limit of quantification (5 ng/mL) in all subjects. 12.4 Microbiology Gatifloxacin is an 8-methoxyfluoroquinolone with a 3-methylpiperazinyl substituent at C7. The antibacterial action of gatifloxacin results from inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme that is involved in the replication, transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme known to play a key role in the partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division. The mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones including gatifloxacin is different from that of aminoglycoside, macrolide, and tetracycline antibiotics. Therefore, gatifloxacin may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics and these antibiotics may be active against pathogens that are resistant to gatifloxacin. There is no cross-resistance between gatifloxacin and the aforementioned classes of antibiotics. Cross-resistance has been observed between systemic gatifloxacin and some other fluoroquinolones.

The mean steady-state C max (2.7 ng/mL) and AUC 0-\u221e (41.9 ng\u25cfhr/mL) values were 1600 and 1100 times lower than the mean C max and AUC reported after therapeutic 400 mg doses of moxifloxacin. The plasma half-life of moxifloxacin was estimated to be 13 hours. 12.4 Microbiology The antibacterial action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme that is involved in the replication, transcription and repair of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme known to play a key role in the partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division. The mechanism of action for quinolones, including moxifloxacin, is different from that of macrolides, aminoglycosides, or tetracyclines. Therefore, moxifloxacin may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics and these antibiotics may be active against pathogens that are resistant to moxifloxacin. There is no cross-resistance between moxifloxacin and the aforementioned classes of antibiotics. Cross-resistance has been observed between systemic moxifloxacin and some other quinolones. In vitro resistance to moxifloxacin develops via multiple-step mutations. Resistance to moxifloxacin occurs in vitro at a general frequency of between 1.8 x 10 -9 to less than 1 x 10 -11 for gram-positive bacteria. Moxifloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the Indications and Usage section: Aerobic Gram-Positive Microorganisms Corynebacterium species* Micrococcus luteus* Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Staphylococcus haemolyticus Staphylococcus hominis Staphylococcus warneri* Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus viridans group Aerobic Gram-Negative Microorganisms Acinetobacter lwoffii* Haemophilus influenza Haemophilus parainfluenzae* Other Microorganisms Chlamydia trachomatis *Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections.

Chemical Structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is a reversible antagonist of muscarine-like actions of acetyl-choline and is therefore classified as an antimuscarinic agent. Atropine is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at non-muscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically. Atropine does not distinguish among the M1, M2, and M3 subgroups of muscarinic receptors. The pupillary constrictor muscle depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine resulting in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis. Atropine also weakens the contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate such that the eye cannot focus for near vision. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, USP 1%, is usually within 40 minutes with maximal effect being reached in about 2 hours. The effect can last for up to 2 weeks in a normal eye. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The bioavailability of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% was assessed in six healthy subjects, 24 to 29 years of age. Subjects received either 0.3 mg atropine sulfate administered as bolus intravenous injection or 0.3 mg administered as 30 mcL instilled unilaterally in the cul-de-sac of the eye. Plasma l-hyoscyamine concentrations were determined over selected intervals up to eight hours after dose administration. The mean bioavailability of topically applied atropine was 63.5 \u00b1 29% (range 19 to 95%) with large inter-individual differences. Mean maximum observed plasma concentration for the ophthalmic solution was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL. Maximum concentration was reached in 28 \u00b1 27 min after administration. Terminal half-life of l-hyoscamine was not affected by route of administration and was calculated to be 3 \u00b1 1.2 hours (intravenous) and 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours (topical ophthalmic). In another placebo-controlled study, the systemic exposure to l-hyoscyamine, and the anti-cholinergic effects of atropine were investigated in eight ocular surgery patients 56 to 66 years of age, following single topical ocular 0.4 mg atropine dose (given as 40 microliters of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%). The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation (SD)) C max of l-hyoscyamine in these patients was 860 \u00b1 402 pg/mL, achieved within 8 minutes of eyedrop instillation. Following intravenous administration, the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of atropine was reported to be longer in pediatric subjects under 2 years (6.9 \u00b1 3.3 hours) and in geriatric patients 65 to 75 years (10 \u00b1 7.3 hours), compared to in children over 2 years (2.5 \u00b1 1.2 hours) and in adults 16 to 58 years (3 \u00b1 0.9 hours). (see 8.4 Pediatric Use). Atropine is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid.

There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids.

It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotreines by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid.

Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade reduces cardiac output in both healthy subjects and patients with heart disease. In patients with severe impairment of myocardial function, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may inhibit the stimulatory effect of the sympathetic nervous system necessary to maintain adequate cardiac function. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in the bronchi and bronchioles results in increased airway resistance from unopposed parasympathetic activity. Such an effect in patients with asthma or other bronchospastic conditions is potentially dangerous. Timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, when applied topically on the eye, has the action of reducing elevated as well as normal intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. The onset of reduction in intraocular pressure following administration of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution can usually be detected within one-half hour after a single dose. The maximum effect usually occurs in one to two hours and significant lowering of intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods as long as 24 hours with a single dose. Repeated observations over a period of one year indicate that the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is well maintained. The precise mechanism of the ocular hypotensive action of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is not clearly established at this time. Tonography and fluorophotometry studies in man suggest that its predominant action may be related to reduced aqueous formation. However, in some studies a slight increase in outflow facility was also observed. Pharmacokinetics In a study of plasma drug concentration in six subjects, the systemic exposure to timolol was determined following twice daily administration of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5%. The mean peak plasma concentration following morning dosing was 0.46 ng/mL and following afternoon dosing was 0.35 ng/mL. Clinical Studies In controlled multiclinic studies in patients with untreated intraocular pressures of 22 mmHg or greater, timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.25% or 0.5% administered twice a day produced a greater reduction in intraocular pressure than 1, 2, 3, or 4% pilocarpine solution administered four times a day or 0.5, 1, or 2% epinephrine hydrochloride solution administered twice a day. In these studies, timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was generally well tolerated and produced fewer and less severe side effects than either pilocarpine or epinephrine.

The mean steady-state C max (2.7 ng/mL) and AUC 0 to \u221e (41.9 ng\u2022hr/mL) values were 1600 and 1100 times lower than the mean C max and AUC reported after therapeutic 400 mg doses of moxifloxacin. The plasma half-life of moxifloxacin was estimated to be 13 hours. 12.4 Microbiology The antibacterial action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme that is involved in the replication, transcription and repair of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme known to play a key role in the partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division. The mechanism of action for quinolones, including moxifloxacin, is different from that of macrolides, aminoglycosides, or tetracyclines. Therefore, moxifloxacin may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics and these antibiotics may be active against pathogens that are resistant to moxifloxacin. There is no cross-resistance between moxifloxacin and the aforementioned classes of antibiotics. Cross-resistance has been observed between systemic moxifloxacin and some other quinolones. In vitro resistance to moxifloxacin develops via multiple-step mutations. Resistance to moxifloxacin occurs in vitro at a general frequency of between 1.8 x 10 -9 to less than 1 x 10 -11 for gram-positive bacteria.

It selectively mimics the effects of naturally occurring substances, prostamides. Bimatoprost is believed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in humans by increasing outflow of aqueous humor through both the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral routes. Elevated IOP presents a major risk factor for glaucomatous field loss. The higher the level of IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After one drop of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution, 0.03% was administered once daily to both eyes of 15 healthy subjects for two weeks, blood concentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and were below the lower limit of detection (0.025 ng/mL) in most subjects within 1.5 hours after dosing.

Its chemical name is (-)-1-(tert-butylamino)-3-[(4-morpholino-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-yl)oxy]-2-propanol maleate (1:1) (salt). Timolol maleate possesses an asymmetric carbon atom in its structure and is provided as the levo-isomer.

Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade reduces cardiac output in both healthy subjects and patients with heart disease. In patients with severe impairment of myocardial function, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may inhibit the stimulatory effect of the sympathetic nervous system necessary to maintain adequate cardiac function. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in the bronchi and bronchioles results in increased airway resistance from unopposed parasympathetic activity. Such an effect in patients with asthma or other bronchospastic conditions is potentially dangerous. Timolol maleate ophthalmic solution USP, when applied topically on the eye, has the action of reducing elevated as well as normal intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. The onset of reduction in intraocular pressure following administration of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution USP can usually be detected within one-half hour after a single dose. The maximum effect usually occurs in one to two hours and significant lowering of intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods as long as 24 hours with a single dose. Repeated observations over a period of one year indicate that the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution USP is well maintained. The precise mechanism of the ocular hypotensive action of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution USP is not clearly established at this time. Tonography and fluorophotometry studies in man suggest that its predominant action may be related to reduced aqueous formation. However, in some studies a slight increase in outflow facility was also observed. Pharmacokinetics In a study of plasma drug concentration in six subjects, the systemic exposure to timolol was determined following twice daily administration of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution USP 0.5%. The mean peak plasma concentration following morning dosing was 0.46 ng/mL and following afternoon dosing was 0.35 ng/mL. Clinical Studies In controlled multiclinic studies in patients with untreated intraocular pressures of 22 mmHg or greater, timolol maleate ophthalmic solution USP 0.25% or 0.5% administered twice a day produced a greater reduction in intraocular pressure than 1, 2, 3, or 4% pilocarpine solution administered four times a day or 0.5, 1, or 2% epinephrine hydrochloride solution administered twice a day. In these studies, timolol maleate ophthalmic solution USP was generally well tolerated and produced fewer and less severe side effects than either pilocarpine or epinephrine. A slight reduction of resting heart rate in some patients receiving timolol maleate ophthalmic solution USP (mean reduction 2.9 beats/minute standard deviation 10.2) was observed."], "manufacturer_name": ["Nordic Pharma, Inc."], "substance_name": ["TIMOLOL MALEATE"], "effective_time": "20250320", "product_ndc": ["69918-601", "69918-602"], "brand_name": ["Timoptic in Ocudose"]}

The pH of the solution is approximately 5.65, and the osmolarity is 242 to 323 mOsM.

Inactive ingredients are sodium citrate dihydrate, hydroxyethyl cellulose, sodium hydroxide, mannitol, and water for injection. Benzalkonium chloride 0.0075% is added as a preservative. Image Image"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma, by reducing aqueous humor secretion. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Dorzolamide hydrochloride is an inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase II. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. Timolol maleate is a beta1 and beta2 (non-selective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. The combined eff ect of these two agents administered as dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily results in additional intraocular pressure reduction compared to either component administered alone, but the reduction is not as much as when dorzolamide administered three times daily and timolol twice daily are administered concomitantly. [See Clinical Studies (14)] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Dorzolamide Hydrochloride When topically applied, dorzolamide reaches the systemic circulation. To assess the potential for systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibition following topical administration, drug and metabolite concentrations in RBCs and plasma and carbonic anhydrase inhibition in RBCs were measured. Dorzolamide accumulates in RBCs during chronic dosing as a result of binding to CA-II. The parent drug forms a single N-desethyl metabolite, which inhibits CA-II less potently than the parent drug but also inhibits CA-I. The metabolite also accumulates in RBCs where it binds primarily to CA-I. Plasma concentrations of dorzolamide and metabolite are generally below the assay limit of quantitation (15nM). Dorzolamide binds moderately to plasma proteins (approximately 33%). Dorzolamide is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine; the metabolite also is excreted in urine. After dosing is stopped, dorzolamide washes out of RBCs nonlinearly, resulting in a rapid decline of drug concentration initially, followed by a slower elimination phase with a half-life of about four months. To simulate the systemic exposure after long-term topical ocular administration, dorzolamide was given orally to eight healthy subjects for up to 20 weeks. The oral dose of 2 mg twice daily closely approximates the amount of drug delivered by topical ocular administration of dorzolamide 2% three times daily. Steady state was reached within 8 weeks. The inhibition of CA-II and total carbonic anhydrase activities was below the degree of inhibition anticipated to be necessary for a pharmacological effect on renal function and respiration in healthy individuals.

Studies in animals and man suggest that the main mechanism of action is increased uveoscleral outflow. Elevated IOP represents a major risk factor for glaucomatous field loss. The higher the level of IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Reduction of the IOP in man starts about 3-4 hours after administration and maximum effect is reached after 8-12 hours. IOP reduction is present for at least 24 hours. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Latanoprost is absorbed through the cornea where the isopropyl ester prodrug is hydrolyzed to the acid form to become biologically active. Distribution The distribution volume in humans is 0.16 \u00b1 0.02 L/kg. The acid of latanoprost can be measured in aqueous humor during the first 4 hours, and in plasma only during the first hour after local administration. Studies in man indicate that the peak concentration in the aqueous humor is reached about two hours after topical administration. Elimination Metabolism Latanoprost, an isopropyl ester prodrug, is hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea to the biologically active acid. The active acid of latanoprost reaching the systemic circulation is primarily metabolized by the liver to the 1,2-dinor and 1,2,3,4-tetranor metabolites via fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. Excretion The elimination of the acid of latanoprost from human plasma is rapid (t 1/2 = 17 min) after both IV and topical administration. Systemic clearance is approximately 7 mL/min/kg.
