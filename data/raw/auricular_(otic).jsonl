Peak plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin were observed within 15 minutes to 2 hours post dose application. Mean \u00b1 SD peak plasma concentrations of dexamethasone were 1.14 \u00b1 1.54 ng/mL (n=9). Peak plasma concentrations ranged from 0.135 ng/mL to 5.10 ng/mL and were on average approximately 14% of peak concentrations reported in the literature following an oral 0.5-mg tablet dose. Peak plasma concentrations of dexamethasone were observed within 15 minutes to 2 hours post dose application. Dexamethasone has been added to aid in the resolution of the inflammatory response accompanying bacterial infection (such as otorrhea in pediatric patients with AOMT). 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme, DNA gyrase, which is needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA.

Ciprofloxacin otic solution, 0.2% is a sterile, preservative-free solution for otic use. Each single-dose container of ciprofloxacin otic solution, 0.2% delivers 0.25 mL of solution equivalent to 0.5 mg of ciprofloxacin. The inactive ingredients are povidone, glycerin, and water for injection. Sodium hydroxide and/or lactic acid may be added to adjust pH. Ciprofloxacin, a fluroquinolone is available as the monohydrochloride, monohydrate salt of 1cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid.

However, the maximum plasma concentration of ciprofloxacin is anticipated to be less than 5 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology The bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase, which is needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Bacterial resistance to quinolones can develop through chromosomally- or plasmid-mediated mechanisms. The mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, is different from that of macrolides. Therefore, ciprofloxacin may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics, and these antibiotics may be active against pathogens that are resistant to ciprofloxacin. In vitro studies demonstrated cross-resistance between ciprofloxacin and some fluoroquinolones.
